# Dinner

Emilio and Kai walked back to the compound.  There was little else they could do other than start tracking Bernstein down, but it was getting dark and that would likely end badly, and dinner called.  Keeping Dolores waiting was not something Emilio wanted to do and Kai was more than happy for the free hot meal.

Their home on the third level of the residences was a showcase of what it meant to gain high rank with in the Venatori.  Their once three children household with Dolores being the leader of the Scrin, their esteemed Watcher, she brought plenty of status to the Vegas.  Emilio's status among the venatori was also very high, just as high as his own, but Kai didn't have live in children, or a spouse, his status was lesser in accommodations, but his place was just as nice.

The entrance to their house was just as Kai remembered it, even though they had been renovating much of the space since all the children have been long and well gone.  Their house was spotless, light greens and white.  The floor was hardwood and polished.  Shoes were discarded neatly by the side of the door.  If Kai had been younger he might have slide across the floor, but the likelihood he'd end up on his ass was high, he refrained from the childish gesture that had always seem to come on such high shined floors.

Dolores greeted Emilio at the door with a casual kiss, then turned to Kai, "It is lovely to have you for dinner."  She wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug.  Had she been any other woman he would have copped a feel, but Dolores was not any other woman, and Kai didn't feel like being kicked out without having been fed - or tarnishing the friendship between him and Emilio.  It would be a waste of over 50 years of understanding.

The eldest of the Vega children and their families were already present.  Eli and his wife sat on the black leather couch, their teen age daughter was sitting next to them typing furiously on her phone.  He would have taken the thing away by now, but these were not his children or his grandchildren he would try to refrain his commentary, but it was difficult.

Sahara and her current lover were sitting across her younger brother and chatting, Kai couldn't make out exactly what the siblings were having a arguing over, likely Kai wouldn't care.

The doorbell rang and Dolores wiped her hands on her apron and went to the door.  She hugged and kissed her youngest son on the cheek and lead him towards the living room.  Dorian was alone, he was the black sheep of his family.  It seemed every family had at least one.  He preferred the company of men and his bloodline was muchly needed, one of the few Venatori who could see the patterns even if he couldn't manipulate them with any strength.  He was the perfect choice for teaching and recruiting Magnus.  And the Venatori knew this.  They wanted more like him, but that required well women to be involved.  It was a challenge, but the man was stepping up to do his duty regardless of his tendancies, Kai could only hope his own son would do the same thing.  He sighed at his own thoughts as he offered the youngest Vega a hand.  "Been a while."

Dorian smiled, "About three years."  Kai frowned, had it really been so long since he'd shared a room with the Vega man?  Dorian added, "Photographic memory."

Kai nodded, "Yes, it must be a terrible nuisance at times.  Never can say Oh I forgot."

Dorian laughed, "I can still claim it but most people who know me will know that I lie.  It's best not to tempt the fates I guess."

Dolores called from the dining room off of the kitchen and living room.  "Dinner is served."

Kai wondered if the matriarch of the Vegas needed a dinner bell at Christmas time.  It might be fun to get get her one for the holiday.  Kai didn't think she'd ever use it, she was far to professional in all things for that.  That was one thing about all the Vegas, they were prim and proper at all times, even in the comforts of their own home.  It had been that way since Emilio was little and he'd come for dinner.

Sahara said grace.  While not overly religious family grace was still one thing they had done.  Kai didn't know any Venatori that followed a strict religious regime.  There were no devote Catholics or Methodist or even Buddhists among them.  The had their own ideology of course but it was not one of worship, that was a personal choice, and it was typically regional, in the United States, most Venatori did not practice any religion, a few families such as the Vegas chose pieces to follow.  Kia suspected it was just a way to bring the family together, and the Vegas were a very close knit family compared to any Kia had ever seen.  His own children he tried to model after the Vegas but it was a poor imitation of what they were.

Even though it was a family dinner Dolores had more than enough places and more than enough food to go around, almost as if she had expected Kai to join them all along.  And perhaps she had.  It wasn't unusual for him to join in their family gatherings even as a boy.

Dinner was chicken stuffed with some delicious cheese type sauce, Dolores didn't reveal her secrets when Sahara asked, not that many of them cooked often.  The cafeteria was usually plenty fine for most anyone, including the Vegas.  

Kai's cellphone buzzed in his pocket, he'd at least remembered to put it on vibrate.  With dinner nearing the end he excused himself, "I need to take this."

A man answered quickly, "Is this Mr. Kai Viddens, father of Nicholas Hampton?"

"What did Nicholas do now?"  Kai's voice was gruff the boy was constantly getting into trouble.  He was so thankful this was the last child, but he was well and grown and there was little need to call his father for antics.

"Sir, I'm afraid to tell you your son has been injured."
