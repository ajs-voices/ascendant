# Inspiration

J had already started his class by the time Nox and Levi had actually shown up.  Late was okay if it wasn't Dae'lin.  Nox opened the classroom door and J gave Nox a wide grin.

Jason beamed, "Everyone, I'd like you to meet my best friend.  He's going to show us all something very special today.   We are going to go up to the roof top and watch Nox skyjump.  He has a new protege, and he'll be spending some time with us today and in the future.  So let's make Mr. Hughes feel welcome."  News traveled fast around here it seemed.

Levi laughed, "I'm Mr. Hughes and, he's just Nox.  I see how I rate."

Jason grinned, "Have you ever called Nox, Mr. Durante?  I don't recommend you try.  But for me, each and ever one of my students are Mr. or Ms."

Nox leaned over and loudly whispered, "That's the southern gentleman in him."  Nox opened up the door and beckoned the class to follow, "Let's go up to the roof.  There are a few rules you must all follow the moment you step foot on the roof."

The small class of five and six year olds lined up and followed Nox out the door.  Levi took up the rear and Jason followed him.  "I am the boss.  What I say is law. If I say freeze I mean immediately.  If I say move you do it.  No one goes near the edge without being on the harness.  There is only Jason at the top and he's going to be busy.  Levi might be able to save you, but he's never seen this.  So harness before you get near the edge, or you will never make that roof again.  Ever!  And the last rule, you do not do this ever without me.  Never.  I don't care what you think you know or what your friends think they know.  I find you on the roof without me, you will NEVER do this again."  Nox pointedly looked at Levi, "That means you too."

Nox stopped at the last door, "Do we all understand?"

Everyone nodded their heads, Levi reluctantly but he did so.

Nox opened the door and J started his spiel, "Skyjumping is something Nox created to get over his fear of heights and falling.  We eventually got here, and the first hundred times or so we glided to the bottom.  Today, Nox is going to show you what inspired me and why I'm now teaching this class."

Nox grinned as he watched Jason set up the cloak around the alley below, "Mr.  Hill is setting up a default canvas so that no one outside the alley sees what is happening.  So no one sees a falling person and calls the cops.  That's kinda awkward."

Jason was finished and turned back to his class. "The belts are over here, start strapping them in, Mr. Hughes, Nox and I will help you secure yourself before you clamp on to the line."

They started strapping in and Nox showed Levi how the straps worked on the only girl in the class.  "Hi, what's your name?"

She smiled up at him, "Elena."

Nox grinned, "Elena, like on the Vampire Diaries, very nice.  You don't drink blood do you?"

Elena giggled, "No sir."

Nox strapped the girl up and tightened the cinches before he let Levi take the next little boy.  Nox smiled at him, "What's your name?"

He whispered shyly, "Charles."

Nox grinned, "Like Professor Xavier?"

The boy giggled, "No sir, like my father."

Nox nodded, "I'm sure he's proud of you."

The boy nodded, "I'm the first Mangus in the blood line."

"Very nice.  You are going to be one to watch out for I think."  Nox encouraged the boy.

All the kids were strapped up and attached to the line.  Nox went to the edge of the roof and looked down, a shiver ran down his spine.  He swallowed hard and turned back around taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly.

He stepped up onto the ledge with his back to the drop.  He gathered all the elements around him and the kids all ooh'd.  Nox could hear Jason speaking softly to them.  Nox closed his eyes as as the fire leapt from his hands, and a small drizzle of rain fell from no where.  He fell backwards feeling the rush of the air.  The air thickened and Nox felt cradled in its warm embrace.  Nox softened the earth and he could sense the world around him slowing.  It was such an odd sensation to be falling and feel completely safe.  It was exhilerating.

The ground rushed underneath him to meet him and Nox felt the earth collapse around him like he was landing in a puddle of mud.  It slowly pushed him back up and he lay on solid earth.  It was a rush.  He lay on the green grass looking up at the height of his decent.

Nox stood up slowly and headed down the alley to the entrance.  Outside the door Nox saw Dorian leaning against the opening of the door and holding the door open with a designer shoed foot.  "Hey."  Nox grinned at Dorian.

"Hey.  Enjoy that?"  Dorian genuinely asked.

Nox smiled, "It's almost heaven."

Dorian kicked the door open and Nox caught it with his hand.  He asked, "Almost heaven?  So if that's not heaven, what is?"

Nox grinned, "Wouldn't you like to know."  He winked suggestively at Dorian.

Nox could have sworn he saw a light red flush over the tanned skin of Dorian Vega.  Had he wanted to know?  Nox grinned playfully.  "I need to get back up there."

Dorian nodded and put his hand on Nox's arm, "I'd like to talk to you about patterns."

Nox smiled trying with all his might to calm his heart rate.  The jump still was causing adrenaline to course through his body, and Dorian's touch wasn't helping much. "Alright.  Whenever is convenient for you.  I've got a billion and one things to do, but no specific order they have to be done in."

Dorian nodded, "Later tonight?  I have a dinner with a new employee and then I'm free."

Nox smiled, "Sounds fine.  Stop by my room, I should be there, we can find someplace quiet to talk I'm sure."

Dorian smiled and dropped his hand back to his side and started up the stairs.  Nox watched him as he walked, his heart still pounding.  He wasn't exactly sure what just happened.  After Dorian disappeared up the stairs Nox took a deep breath and headed up that way himself.

He'd hardly been missed by the time Nox opened the door to the roof, everyone was talking frantically.  He heard Charles exclaim, "He bent all four elements at the same time."  They all turned when they saw him open the door.  It was like a mad rush to him, all of the children were trying to talk at the same time, Nox couldn't understand any of them, it was a din of chaos.  He grinned to himself.

J calmed then down with a quick whistle and they all turned their attention to him.  "Leave the man be."  J laughed.  "Come on let's go back to class and discuss what we saw calmly."

J clapped Nox on the shoulder, "Good job.  Inspiration done.  Thanks man."

Nox grinned, "No problem."

Levi looked at Nox expectantly, "Go ahead, I'll catch up on some work, just stay with J till I come get you."  Levi nodded with a smile and headed down with the much younger class.  That went well.  Nox was happy about that.  Maybe the kid would straighten out sooner rather than later.  One could only hope.
