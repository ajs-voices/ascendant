# Death of A Family Member

Nox was left up on the roof for a little while, he leaned against the wall and took in the scenery.  It had been a very long time since he'd been up this high and not have his feet on the ground.  He had loved being in the mountains.  But this was home.  It really was.

But there were things to do, Nox went to the Archives.  He smiled at the woman at the desk, he was disappointed it wasn't Mrs. Vega.  He remembered the path they had taken before and found himself in front of the door the Exuli files were located.

Nox twisted the door knob and opened the door to a dark room that smelled of old musty books.  Nox reached around the door frame and searched for the light switch.  When he found it and flipped it on the lights flickered before they stayed on permanently.  The fluorescent lighting gave off a much yellower hue than the lights in the other rooms.  This room hadn't been remodeled anytime in the recent past.

The books lining the walls were of varying sizes and shapes and you could tell which were the oldest ones.  Nox found the records for the past 6 decades all neatly stacked on the table.  He smiled at the anticipation of the Scrin who had helped him.  Nox wondered if it was Mrs. Vega's doing or if someone else had been in the room exploring.

But it didn't really matter, Nox opened the first book, it was the oldest and he started flipping through records looking for names he recognized.  A knock from the door brought Nox out of his little world.  He looked up and saw the girl at the desk.  He smiled at her and she frowned.  He voice was tight and coiled like she was ready to fly off the handle, "I was asked to give these to you when you returned."

Nox stood up and walked around the other side of the table where she stood and took the proffered file folders.  "Thanks."  He dropped them on the desk and sat back down in the seat he'd taken.  The girl watching him the whole time.  She looked like she was ready to bite nails.  He looked up, "Something else?"

She snapped her mouth shut and turned tail and left.  Nox went back to his work.  It wasn't like Kai's minions weren't all over the place.  The files looked to be the records he'd been combing through before his computer tumbled to the ground.  At least some of them, the ones related to the exiles Kai had been party too.

Ironically Nox found Levi's parents in the books.  They'd chosen to leave the community, they had moved to the Windy City.  As Low-level Magnus, they were not expected to go anywhere.  They were disgruntled but left without burning any bridges, they had even registered Levi himself.  It was sad.  Nox set the files aside for updating.  There was no point in letting something as simple as death slip through the cracks because no one was being watchful.

Nox set aside several files that held questionable Exuli who would need to be accounted for as the fire siren's started.  The loud blaring noise indicated it was a fire of sorts, it wasn't a fire-starter signal, the alarm itself indicated where it was.  If you knew the patterns you would know what it meant.  As a fire-starter himself he'd learned the codes, it was more of a way to insure he wasn't caught so much as learning about safety for Nox.

The alarm indicated with three long beeps followed by a short that it was in the adult residences, third floor.  That was were Kai and the Vegas held homes.  When he stepped off the elevator, Nox saw Kai running past him.  Nox walked quickly, he didn't run, the last thing he needed was for his father to see him.  He wasn't happy that he was on the case to begin with, he wasn't going to be happy that he was here.

The fire squad was already on the scene, the sirens had already been squelched.  Around the next corner, Nox saw Dorian consoling his father.  The man was sobbing hysterically into his son's shoulder.   Sahara, Dorian's older sister, was decked out in nothing but a tight pair of bike shorts and a sports bra.  Her hair was tied up in a ponytail, and from the looks of the sweat glistening on her body she'd run up all the flights of stairs from the gym here.  That was a lot of stairs Nox noted.  He'd done it himself on many occasions.

Sahara put her hand on Mr. Vega's shoulder and he looked up and the sobs rolled harder as he wrapped his arms around his daughter.  She gave Dorian a look of disdain and took a weird sort of pleasure having displaced her youngest brother.

Nox gave Dorian a sad frown and then walked into the living room that had once been grand from the looks of the edge, but now everything was charred black.  Soot lay everywhere, the clean white walls were now dingy gray, the white carpet looked like it had had better days.

Nox sighed when he saw what remained of the woman that had been Dorian's mother.  He fought back the bile that threatened to rise up from his boiling stomach.  He had just spoken to her, only a few hours ago.  He remembered her bright smile and her green eyes shining brightly - reminding him so much of her son who now stood beside him.  The fury, the rage, the pure hatred for someone who would do such a thing to this woman.  To anyone.  It was why Nox hunted, to stop things like this from happening, And here it was right in his back door.

Nox blinked away the tears that threatened to fall and took in the scene, the patterns, everything that was left over.  His heart went out to the Vegas.   Nox could see the lingering pattern.  But it really wasn't helpful, fire, air and earth all scattered to the winds, what it was originally had been obliterated in the expolsion.

Nox shook his head, "Another mail bomb?"

Kai pushed over to him and got into Nox's face, he was a real prick.  "Yeah, what of it?"

"No one was put on the mail room?  Like I suggested?"  Nox asked but he knew the answer already.

Kai looked at him with a blank look.  "Why would we do that?  Put some high-level Magnus on the mail room just to watch for bombs.  No one wants to do that?"

Nox sighed.  "Your son almost died and now Mrs. Vega has been blown up by a fucking mail bomb and someone could have prevented the last from going off until it was inspected by someone who can read the patterns.  It's not fucking rocket science."

Kai pushed Nox and Nox was about to throw a wall of air and push Kai into a wall when Dae'lin stepped in.  "Nox is right, we should have.  We will now.  Nox can you get anything off the patterns?"

Nox shook his head, "No everything scattered.  I'm not into the rebuilding of the pattern, but maybe you can put a call out to a Magnus that's Scrin too and can do it.  It's still here, the pieces, but they'll dissipate soon, they are already starting too."

Dae'lin nodded for Nox to follow, Kai stared at him incredulously.  He then moved to speak with Emilio.  Dae'lin lead Nox away from the apartment the Vegas kept and into much quieter hall.  The alarms had been ceased but the world around them still buzzed with excitement.  Dae'lin frowned at Dorian, "I'm so sorry for your loss."

Dorian gave her a weak grin.  Nox had no words for him.  I'm sorry just didn't cut it.  The look on Dorian's face made Nox want to reach out and comfort the man.  He put his hand on his shoulder and squeezed.  Dorian almost relaxed into the gesture, but he stood his ground.  Nox knew he was trying to be strong.  It was a lot harder than it looked.

Nox remembered the day his mother had died.  It wasn't in the cave that she'd been attacked in, no it was an infirmary much like the one Nick was in right now.  Except there was nothing they could do now.  Even Venatori are not immune to the venom of a were creature.  While they don't turn on the full moon, it is one of few venoms that override the antibodies that allow an them to heal quickly, it's not quick enough.  It was almost like lycanthropy (and vampirism for that matter) were designed just to kill Venatori.

Nox remembered watching his mother writhe in agony from the window outside her room.  She didn't want anything to do with him.  He could hear her blaming him for the pain when the nurses left the room.  His heart sank each time.  That was his mother, and that was how she felt about him.

Nox pushed the thoughts away and spoke softly,  "I'll watch the mail room since no one else can be bothered to do a check when the damn mail comes in.  Recall every package.  And under no circumstances will any packages be delivered to the Videns or the Vegas until this bastard is caught."

Dorian frowned, "Your talents can be more useful elsewhere Nox. We will find someone else."

Nox shook his head.  "No.  I'm going to do it.  Ya'll had your chance to put someone in place.  I made a suggestion, it was not followed up on by the powers that be because I'm a lowly shit hunter that Kai Videns hates.  I'll do the shit work too."

Nox started to walk away but Dorian grabbed his arm, "Nox.  Please don't..."

Nox turned and smiled at Dorian, "I'm not mad at you or Dae'lin or even the uppity ups who don't listen.  But this was your mother, Dorian.  Your. Mother.  I won't let your father die, or your brother or sister die because some idiot thinks I'm stupid. No matter what Kai says about me, I'm not going to let him, or Nick or anyone of his children be taken from this world because of his stupidity."

Dae'lin sighed, "No one thinks you are stupid Nox.  Kai's jealous.  He always has been."

Nox laughed, "Good for him.  He can get over himself.  I'm not going to let another person die on my watch because of stupidity.  And while we are at it.  I think we need to put a person who can read patterns on the regular sweeps around the compound.  If the prick is inside these walls, he can put a bomb on the doors, or toilets or anything and everything in here and half the world would be oblivious to it."

Dae'lin nodded, "I will make the suggestion, and ensure it is followed through.  And while I take no joy in taking the credit Nox, I will not mention your name."

Nox nodded, "Fine so long as it gets done."

Nox ran his hand down Dorian's arm and took his hand to pulled him away from Dae'lin.  Dorian followed still in shock.  They walked hand in hand for several corridors before Nox stopped and turned towards Dorian.  "I'm sorry about your mother.  If there is anything I can do to help you and your family.  Let me know."

Dorian gave Nox a weak smile, "You already are doing more than necessary.  I don't think I want to be alone tonight, still up for discussing patterns later?"

Nox nodded, "Sure thing, anything you need.  I'm going to hit the mail room and give the orders myself.  And scan what I can while it's there.  I'll see you later."

Dorian nodded, "Later it is then."
