# Protege

Nox left the ICU with hope on his brain.  He was lost in his thoughts as he walked down the stairs.  The sound of footsteps were just part of the surroundings until Nox rounded the last bend in the stairs down as someone was coming up.  Nox looked down and saw Dorian staring back up at him in surprise.  He smiled, "I was just coming to warn you."

Nox raised an eyebrow and took a step back to give Dorian room to step up onto the platform as he continued, "My mother informed me you were up seeing Nicholas and when I saw Kai back in the building I figured you'd need to be elsewhere."

Nox grinned, "Thanks for the warning.  Pretty sure Nick isn't going to rat me out so I am good there too."

Dorian smiled, "You sound like you know Nicholas."

Nox laughed, "We were lab partners once upon a time.  Surely you remember that."  Nox started down the stairs and Dorian followed as he parsed through his memory banks.  Nox wondered how the man did what he did.  He had to have a photographic memory for the amount of information he stored and accessed so easily.

Dorian nodded, "Chemistry yes?"

Nox grinned, "And a little Biology."

Nox smiled as it finally dawned on Dorian what he meant.  "He wasn't the boy Dae'lin caught you kissing was he?"

Nox nodded, "He was.  I wish someone would have told me he was my half brother, it would have made so much more sense why Dae'lin insisted very strongly to stay away from Nick.  I believe the threat was, 'You ever see that boy in anything other than school work and I'll not only have your hide, I'll hang it from my office wall.'"

Dorian chuckled softly as he shook his head, "That sounds like Dae'lin.  I suppose the idea of you and Nick was less of a threat than your father knowing about you or you him before you were ready.  It was better this way, I promise.  As a student here you'd never have gotten away from Kai's treatment.  At least now you can do something about it."sti

Nox laughed, "I honestly don't know what he would have done if he'd known about me from the beginning.  Maybe there would be less hatred, less jealousy.  Either way.  I kissed my brother, and not in a brotherly sort of way if Dae'lin hadn't caught us we'd probably have done a whole lot more that night.  Rather hard fact to swallow."

"I also have a favor to ask of you, " Dorian smiled.

"Shoot."

"I have a new Magnus.  He's rather ... difficult to say the least.  His third mentor resigned from his service today citing irrevocable differences.  He's a good kid - rather he could be a good kid.  I know it."  Nox trusted Dorian's opinion.  He'd come to rely on it more and more as he'd grown up  here in the academy.  He'd always been an advisor, steering him correct, but always letting him make the choices.    So if Dorian said this kid could be better than what he was, he knew it to be true.

Dorian continued without heed of Nox's internal thoughts, "Since you are here for an indeterminate amount of time I'd like you to try to mentor him.  If we cannot get him to learn about his gift, there is only one choice left.  And I do not like the idea of turning his potential into a Tacet."

"He's that bad?  And you think I can teach him."  Nox was surprised.

"You are more like him than the others.  Outcasts.  He's sixteen, Nox.  He was found on the streets, his parents dead.  A house fire they didn't escape from.  Likely he set it by accident when he came into his powers."  Dorian frowned, "He has no one.  Maybe you and he can get along, even if you can't teach him, he might listen to you."

Nox smiled, "Yeah, sure.  When?"  Dorian grinned, Nox laughed, "Now, is best I take it."

Dorian nodded with a smile and took the nearest corridor to the academy testing area. It was a familiar walk through the compound, Nox had done it many times before.  It had been nearly three years since he'd walked this way last.  Three years ago he'd followed Dorian at a small distance, today he walked evenly with him, he wasn't being lead, he was a colleague.  That was an odd feeling.  Nox grinned, "This is different."

Dorian asked, "How so?"  He glanced at Nox with a smile, a knowing smile.

Nox had to laugh, "The last time I walked this way I followed you a few paces behind."

"Tell me of the kid you are taking me to."  Might as well talk and walk at the same time. Nox couldn't help but glance Dorian's direction taking in his profile as they walked.  It was distracting and he kept his eyes forward but the urge to steal a glance never left.

"He was brought in from the streets a few months ago.  He was starved and dehydrated and was not in any shape what-so-ever to do much of anything.  We fed him and gave him a safety zone.  A hunter found him in a homeless shelter starting fires with the snap of his fingers."

"Untrained in fire, but he has control.  That's unusual.  He's sixteen?"  Nox was skeptical.

Dorian nodded, "Yes, he's 16."

Nox laughed, "Sixteen and just now being found!"  It was very hard to believe. "Someone had to find him.  No one is that talented.  Particularly fire-starters."

Dorian agreed, "Yes but he won't tell us any names.  He is hardly forth coming at all.  Every mentor we've put him under has complained and he's ended up back in my care.  You are the last one.  I've already told you the consequences of his failure to listen to you.  We've tried everything. Maybe someone closer in age will help him."

Nox nodded, "What have the others done?"

"He's working on his GED online.  He's too far behind to stick in classes his own age for schooling and if we'd stick him where he needs to be he'd be even more out of place.  He's restricted to his quarters when not with his mentor or in the lab because he's just a terror on everyone."  Dorian sighed.

Nox smiled, "Put him in classes.  I don't care what.  Art, Music, PE with kids his age.  Stick him in Jason's class, he's supposedly working some new angle. Dae'lin's got a few advanced kids she's tutoring in multiple elements, put him in there too.   I'll watch him in them until he's behaving if I have to.  You can't isolate a kid and expect him to behave like he understand social interactions.  As a matter of fact, stick him in all of Jason's classes.  The younger the better.  If he's multi-talented and you think he could be Cesari too well then he can inspire them, help them too."

Dorian laughed, "You take the opposite approach to everyone.  I will create a schedule that he can start after we get you on a real schedule here.  But more importantly how did you guess my speculation of the boy?"

Nox smiled, "Why else would you choose me as your last attempted instead of the last person.  You didn't know I was coming to town."

Dorian opened a testing room door with a smile.  Dorian let Nox go in first and closed the door behind both of them.  "Levi, this is Nox.  He is going to be your new mentor.  Remember lad, what we discussed."

The boy was slumped in the chair, one leg over the arm the opposite arm hanging over the other arm like he'd been plopped in the chair without any bones.  He hid his face beneath a baseball cap sporting the Sox logo like Aaron's earlier.  He reminded Nox of a puppet from the marionette show he'd seen as a young child.  Something to entertain the kids he didn't remember much else of it.  Nox wondered if he could pull the strings like the puppet and make him dance.  The thought brought a smile to Nox's face and the boy sneered at him.

Nox noticed that the boy wasn't actually sneering at him, but Dorian's retelling of what it meant to be Tacet.  Nox smiled and interrupted Dorian, "I got this."

Dorian chuckled, "As you wish."  Dorian left the room, but he knew he'd go to the other side of the mirror and watch them.

Nox pulled the chair out and sat down and leaned back.  The chair balanced on its two back legs.  Nox solidified the air around and under the chair to stabilize the chair from falling over.  Nox smiled, "So, Levi..."

Levi glanced at Nox and then looked under the table and stood up.  He walked around the table and squatted down to look at the chair,  "How are you doing that?"

Nox smiled, "You can't see it?"  Levi shook his head.  "You don't see the pattern holding the chair steady?  Try harder.  It's there.  You can manipulate air, Dorian says he tested you."

Levi took his hat off and clipped it to his belt loop then ran his han through his dark hair, "I just blew a bubble."  Nox grinned at the modesty.

"With your mind inside a box.  Come on, think how would you do that if you could see air?"

Nox pulled himself out of the tilting chair proving that he was indeed using his ability to hold the chair steady.  The empty chair balanced on the back two legs at a 45 degree angle.  "Here I'll add something you can see with it."

Nox manipulated his pattern and it looked like a dirt cloud had formed underneath his chair.  "Look for the pattern.  Each one is unique, everyone has their own pattern.  Think of them like lattice work.  You know those fake looking things up the side of houses that have vines and roses and such climbing up them.  But each object, each element create different lattices.  I'd go on about chemical bonds or crystalline structures and the like but that's too much like Dae'lin for my preferences."

Levi stared at the chair,and started poking his finger at it.  He asked, "Who's Dae'lin?  Your girlfriend or wife?"

Nox gave a sharp laugh which made Levi jump from where he was with a glance backwards.  "Sorry.  Dae'lin was my mentor, she's now my boss.  She insisted I maintain an A average in everything which meant I spent most of my free time with my nose in a book, or on the computer trying to find answers to things the book wasn't helping me understand."

"Sounds like torture."  Levi added without looking back at Nox.

"It was at times.  But I had an hour everyday to goof off.  J insisted that I did, or he'd beat on me until I went and did something fun."

"Your boyfriend?"

Nox laughed.  "Damn boy.  You think I'm in love with everyone?"

Levi turned around and shook his head, "No it's just the way you talk about them.  I remember my parents talking that way about each other."

Nox nodded, "Well, Jason is my best friend, never more, but the only real family I have.  And Dae'lin is just my teacher I have no feelings for her other than true respect and I suppose a vague sense of family."

"I am sorry about the loss of your parents.  I know it's not easy."  Nox added with sadness in his voice.

Levi sat flat on the ground, like the weight of the world crushed him, "What would you know about it?"

"I wasn't as young as you when I lost my mother.  But she sent me away when I was 5 years old.  I never saw her again until I was 18.  So she might as well have already been gone."  Nox sighed, "On one of my first hunts after graduation.  I went back home, to my mother's home.  She needed help with a rogue were-bear.  It was terrorizing the community and humans alike.  It needed to be stopped but bullets weren't helping so they needed something a little more powerful."

Levi looked up at Nox, the story intriguing him at least, Nox continued, "She and I went out to its lair.  It attacked, she'd insisted on going first, the veteran Venatori and all that jazz.  She took a swipe to the stomach and chest area, disemboweling her.  I managed to get a fireball off before it raked me and left me with a nice scar on my chest.  But it was dead.  I would live if I could get to help, but I was unable to save my mother.  If I'd insisted on going first I could have prevented the mess.  I'd have had shields and the like, but my mother was stubborn.  She'd told me, none of that magic stuff.  It was my magic that saved me and why I'd been called in.  But she was old school."

Levi turned back to the chair, "She was stupid.  No offense."

Nox nodded, "None taken, I think she was rather stupid myself."

Levi asked, "What about your dad?"

Nox grinned and pulled the other chair around the table to sit down, "I didn't know my dad, still technically I don't.  I mean I now know who he is, but to me he's just some punk who hates me.  He can join the club of haters.  I don't really care."

"Tell me what you see Levi."  Nox asked with caution, he didn't want to push the boy too far, too fast.

Levi shrugged.  "I don't know."

Nox pushed himself to the floor and removed the pattern holding the chair up, it fell to the ground in a noise crash echoing on the empty walls.  "Turn around, look at me."

Nox sat cross-legged on the floor and put his hands on his knees.  "What's your strongest element?"

"Water."

Nox grinned, "Of course it would be my weakest.  Okay.  There is water all around us, its in the air, its in our bodies, you are 4?  You can replicate if it's there."

Levi nodded, "That's what I've been told."

Nox sighed but the door behind him opened and Dorian was handing him a bottle of water.  Nox grinned looking over his shoulder, "You read my mind."

Dorian smiled, "I'll find the rest of the materials for you and bring them so you have things to work with."

Nox nodded as Dorian shut the door.  "Okay.  Water is slippery, it moves and shifts and it moves like, well, water, the pattern is constantly shifting, it is one of the hardest to manipulate for that fact."

Nox poured a small amount of water in his hand, "Focus on the water in my hand."  Nox shifted the water around doing nothing more than changing the patterns inside.  "I don't want you to do anything until you can see the pattern.  Until you can see the shifts."

Levi blinked, "I think I see something, but I don't know."

Nox grinned, "Hold out your hand."  Nox poured a small amount of water in Levi's hand, "Okay, replicate the pattern you see now, exactly as mine is."

Levi shifted his water and it held its form but it wasn't the same pattern.  Nox smiled, "Good try, here."  Nox pointed to a part of the pattern that was off.  "Fix this area.  Don't make it look like the water, look at the pattern."

Levi tossed the water at Nox, Nox shook his head with a grin.  "It's hard when you can just do it.  You have to see the pattern.  You can't recreate it if you can't see it.  You are a fire starter too.  Let's work with fire."

Levi shook his head, "Thanks for the reminder."  Levi got up and kicked the chair.

"Hey.  It's okay.  I was a fire-starter too.  It's why mother sent me away.  She believes that children shouldn't be treated differently because they don't know better.  When a supernatural is dangerous, they are dangerous, it doesn't matter.  So she quickly sent me away, so I didn't have to be around her and make her conflicted.  So look, I understand."

Nox pulled out a lighter from his pocket.  It was something he carried in case of an emergency.  In case he couldn't create fire, he always had some on hand.  Nox flicked the lighter open and put his hand over the fire and pulled the flame from the lighter and it sat just above his hand.  "Watch now."

Nox changed the pattern of the flame, it remained the same, but the internal structure changed, it hollowed out and was a flaming sphere instead of a solid ball.  Levi would have to see the pattern and not replicate the ball in full.  "Try."

Nox saw Levi take the fire with ease, but he couldn't exactly get the pattern, the difficulty and the frustration were lined on his face.  Nox smiled, "That's enough for now.  I know you want to just create, and replicate as you see fit.  As you see it, but if you learn the patterns, can see them in anything , you can train your eye to find them you will be able to do great things.  There are not many Cesari."

Levi's flames winked out, "What's Cesari?"

Nox smiled, "Cesari are Magnus who can bend all the elements at the same time."

"So I'm that?"  Levi sounded doubtful.

Nox grinned, "You are.  Dorian suspects it, but I know it."

"How do you know that Nox?"  A tinny version of Dorian's voice came over the intercom.

"The way the pattern around him moves.  It's different than say Dae'lin's.  Everyone's is different, we vibrate on different frequencies, but all Cesari I've ever met the patterns all flow toward them.  It's a magnetic like attraction to all elements.  A water bender attracts water and repeal everything else.  Those like Dae'lin who can bend all four, they oscillate between things.  Dae'lin attracts air much easier than fire, but the patterns shift in a pattern of osculation.  I'm sure there is a mathematical equation that could tell you but I'm not that interested in that.  But you can see the differences if you pay attention  The differences are small but I made a habit of studying patterns the day you showed me them."

Dorian chuckled over the intercom.

Nox grinned, "Come on Levi.  I have a class I want to take you to."  Nox stood up from his spot on the floor and opened the door, "It'll be a bunch of little kids, but I would like you to listen to the class.  J claims to have a new way of thinking about things, maybe he'll help you out too."

Dae'lin stood outside the door leaning against the wall waiting for them to exit.  She smiled but it was her angry smile.  Nox grinned at her with what she called his smart ass smile.  She shook her head, "You didn't tell me you saw patterns that way."

Nox shrugged, "You never asked about the things I studied outside of what you taught me."

Dae'lin nodded, "Did you tell Dorian?"

Nox shook his head, "He never asked either."

Dae'lin sighed, "Did you tell Jason?"

Nox shook his head again, "J knew I studied patterns, not specifics, but I didn't tell him about the patterns around people."

Dae'lin nodded, "The four of us need to sit down and discuss this.  You need to teach others if you won't teach them yourself.  This is new Nox.  We've never had a Cesari do what you do.  All they want to do is create and bend and be gods in their own minds."

Levi asked he was listening with interest and Nox was glad, "We can be like God?"

Nox shook his head, "No.  Some Cesari believe we can.  They've mastered the art of creating cadavers and objects that resemble living things, but it's never living.  Can't even be used for transplanting.  I don't believe you can create life.  We can't make the patterns come to life, and if we could we probably shouldn't do it.  It'd be like Frankenstein all over again."

Levi was incredulous, "That was real?"

Nox grinned and Dae'lin gave a soft giggle, but Nox was the one to respond, "Nah, man, just an analogy.  Come on we don't want to be late.  Late gets us in trouble."  Nox winked at Dae'lin and they headed towards the classrooms.
