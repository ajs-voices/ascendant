# Best Friends

The alarm on Nox's phone went off waking him up.  He hadn't realized he'd fallen asleep. Nox wiped the drool from his lips with the back of his hand and rolled over and sat up to find his phone to turn the infernal alarm off.  It squawked at him for several seconds before he could swipe it off.

Blinking away the sleep that still fogged his head, Nox saw the laptop sitting idle by the screen had turned off.  He'd been asleep at least an hour.

There was a knock at the door, Nox found his shirt crumbled in a ball on the chair and decided to leave it there as he walked to the door. A hand snaked its way to his chest before he could object and was he pushed into the room.  The southern drawl of Jason's voice punctuated everything he said, "I need to talk to you."

Jason pushed past him and Nox had no choice but to let his friend in.  

Jason was talking too fast and Nox couldn't catch anything he said, when he was flustered or excited his accent obscured everything he said.  The cajun had been smacked out of him by nearly every teacher and bully at the academy, but with Nox it came back easily and in full force.

Nox watched and Jason never stopped or slowed.  He shook his head and stepped closer, the best and easiest way to make him slow down was to make him shut up. Nox took the few steps to close the distance to Jason and tilted his friend's chin and placed a gentle kiss against Jason's lips.  

J blinked back at him but he had stopped talking.  "What the hell was that for?"


Nox grinned at him, "I had to shut you up.  It seemed to work."  Nox paused as Jason punched him in the arm.  "I did not understand anything after you said you needed to talk to me.  Slow down, and start again."

J grinned back at him, "Well don't do that again unless you intend to follow through."  J winked at Nox as he walked away and started pacing.  His other bad habit.  J walked three steps with his hands behind his back, and turned on his heel and started walking the other direction for three steps then back again.  He did that twice before he looked at Nox and shook his head.  Nox sat on the edge of the bed as he watched his friend pace.

"I got married." J looked astonished like he just realized it.

"I know.  You told me."

"You weren't there.  You weren't here to stop me."  

Nox laughed, "You wanted me to stop you?"

J flopped on the bed bouncing Nox and the laptop.  "No.  You weren't here.  That's all I'm saying."

Nox grinned, "I'm here now.  Talk."

Staring up at the ceiling J shook his head, "No.  I just missed you is all."  His best friend half sat up and leaned back on his elbows as he stared at Nox.  "I went and got married and you couldn't stop me."  He grinned playfully at Nox.  "I like Mia.  I do.  Love her even.  But I didn't have to marry her.  But we are going to have a baby.  It's what I was taught.  How my parents raised me."

Nox grinned at his friend, "I know all southern gentleman."

Jason fell backwards flailing his arms behind him.  Nox watched as his laptop flew off the bed, knocked over by one of J's arms.  Both of them moved quickly, but neither of them could stop the crash on the carpeted floor.  They could soften the ground, but carpet was a different matter, for all their throwing themselves over buildings, they couldn't stop the laptop's demise.

J looked guilty, "So sorry man."  He even winced in pain, "I know that was your life in there."

Nox picked up the laptop, it had fallen just right, and it was now a mess.  "Shit happens.  Maybe IT can get the data off the harddrive."

Jason sighed, "I'll help you replace it."

"No need.  It was time for a replacement anyway."  Nox laughed.  "But it seems I'm off to the computer dungeon's first thing though.  Then I guess I'll hit the archives to finish my research."

"You never take a break do you?"  J had that concerned looked on his face that said he knew Nox didn't plan on staying here.  And Nox still hadn't made up his mind.  This was home, but he and it never really got along.

"I have lives to save.  It's my job."  Nox grinned at his friend.  "Come on let's go get breakfast."
