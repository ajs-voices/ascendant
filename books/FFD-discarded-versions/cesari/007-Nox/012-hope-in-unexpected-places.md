# Hope In Unexpected Places

Jason walked slowly, he was stalling.  Nox stopped and turned to his friend, "What's wrong?"

J shook his head, "Nothing.  Why do you let them do that to you?  You could have stopped it before it began.  You have no idea how many people would have cheered if you'd beat him down."

Nox laughed, "To prove what?  That I'm bigger and badder than he is?  I don't care about him.  Call it a habit - self preservation.  If I don't start it, I'm not in the wrong."

J nodded, "You should still kick the shit out of him."  Jason started walking again and Nox caught up to walk with his friend.  "He's only gotten worse since we were kids."

"I noticed, he's got a whole group of boys following his every stupid move now."

Jason stopped at a set of doors leading to the stair well.  "I got a class to teach.  If you find some free time stop by.  Go sky jumping for the kids.  They'd love to see it really done by a pro.  Show them what inspired me, what they are aspiring too."

Nox grinned, "You want me to jump off a building for your class?"

J laughed, "Yeah.  Come, it'll be fun.  The kids will adore you."

"I'll try.  Catch ya later man."  Nox watched as Jason headed up the stairs.  Nox had to go the other direction, down.  But it was WAY down, in the basement, where they kept all the smart people.  A stupid place if you ask him, but he wasn't the all powerful tech god.  

Nox went to his room and grabbed the broken laptop and took the elevator down into the dungeon's below, at least that's what they had liked to call the basement as kids.  It still felt very much the same.  It smelled of must and dust.  Nox could smell the slight smell of burnt silicone from the dead and dying machines that their IT department collected. 

Nox knocked on the door to the technician's bat cave.  It actually said "Bat Cave" on the door.  A man, no he was a boy, he couldn't be more than fifteen looked up from the desk.  "Can I help you?"

Nox held up the busted laptop.  The boy looked at him with a frown, "You don't expect me to fix that do you?"

Nox laughed, "Not unless you think you can.  I'm pretty sure it's dead though.  I was hoping you could save my data on the hard drive though.  Throw it on a flash drive or into the cloud and I'll put it on a new one."

The boy looked at him with disdain, "You think I have the time to do you a favor?"

Nox grinned, he glanced at the boy's nameplate sitting at the front of his very crowded desk, 'Nate Monroe', it was a miracle the nameplate hadn't fallen off already from the number of computer parts and manuals that sat on the boy's desk.  "Well, Nate.  I don't expect it to be now.  But any help at all I would appreciate, even if it means telling me what I can do to get it done myself.  It has a lot of things I do really need to do my job when on the road.  But I'd lose music and pictures and other things of a personal nature.  Things that aren't so easily replaceable."

The boy gave Nox a dry laughed, "I'm sure your porn is easily replaceable."  

It was meant as an insult Nox was sure but Nox laughed at it, Nox joked, "I dunno, some of them girls I filmed are pretty damn hot.  I'd hate to lose that footage."

The boy paled.  Nox grinned, "But in all seriousness, I could really use your help.  When you have time, I'll leave it here, and in the meantime I'll go do my own research.  Google is a wonderful tool."  Nox took his card from his wallet in his back pocket.  "You can reach me here if you need anything."

Nate reached out and took the card and glanced at it.  "You're him then?"

Nox laughed, "Him who?"

"That son of Kai Videns, the half huma cesari, the one who is on Mr. Videns' shit list.  My mother would have my head if I helped you."

Nox frowned, "Ah I see rumors reach the dungeon too."

Nate sighed, "What he doesn't know won't hurt him."

"Who's your mother, so I know who to avoid?" Nox was genuinely curious who would threaten their own child for helping him.

The boy looked even younger at that moment.  "Iris Monroe, she's your half sister, which would technically make you my uncle."

Nox blinked back at the boy, he was a Viden.  He shook his head and picked up his laptop, "Nah, it's alright kid, I'll do it myself.  I don't want you in trouble with Kai too."

Nate stood up, "You are here to help right?  Leave your laptop.  I'll do what you ask and not tell anyone I helped you."  He walked around his desk and looked up at Nox, "Just find the bastard who is trying to kill us."

Nox gave the boy a wry grin, "I'll do my best.  You sure about this?"

He nodded and picked up the laptop and took it over to his desk, "Yeah.  I'm sure.  I don't know why Grandfather doesn't like you, you seem decent enough."

Nox laughed, "It's a long story.  Thanks for your help."  Nox left thinking maybe there was still a little bit of hope in making this place the home it should be.  If someone under the direct influence of Kai was willing to see past his father's hatred then maybe others could too.  At least there was hope now.
