# The Common Area

Nox grabbed a shirt from his bag, he grinned as he pulled the red t-shirt over his head.  J looked at him and shook his head, "I'd hit that."  The shirt depicted a pinata with those words underneath.  He laughed, "Mia made me get rid of all those shirts.  Said they were childish."

Nox laughed as he closed the room to his door.  "I am childish."

They walked down two flights of stairs to the common area.  Breakfast was in full swing though the cafeteria was empty at this hour.  A familiar red-headed cook stood behind her plate glass barrier serving up food.  Nox grinned at her, "Morning Ms. Sheila."

She looked up from her plate with a smile, "Well, look-ee here.  Ain't you a sight for sore eyes.  All growed up and everything.  I heard you were back in town."

Nox grinned, "All growed up, at least on the outside.  I'll have whatever you got cooking."

Ms. Sheila smiled, "I remember the first day you showed up here with Dorian Vega.  So small and quiet.  Look at you now.  Loud and obnoxious and not so small."

Nox laughed, "Yes, ma'am, that was a long time ago."

She grinned at him as she handed him a plate, 
Jason chimed in, "True dat."

Nox rolled his eyes.  "Can't take the country out of the boy can we?"

Ms. Sheila rolled her eyes.  "Just like we can't take the sarcasm outta you boy."  She smiled.  "Move along now before you hold up the line."

Nox laughed, "Line?  We are the last of the line."  And just as he said that a gaggle of girls probably in their early teens giggled into the doorway.  Jason stepped passed Nox like he was afraid of the giggling girls.  Nox laughed, "How things have changed."

One of the girls pointed at him and giggled and whispered to her friend.  He'd have liked to have heard what she said, and he could have if he'd been prepared for it, but what did he care what little girls had to say about him.

Nox nodded a farewell to Ms. Sheila, "Until dinner."  He gave her a flourished bow and the girls behind him giggled more.  Nox laughed as he gave them the same bow.  "Ladies."  

Nox heard Ms. Shiela comment, "Always a flirt."  The comment sending the girls into more giggling and Nox couldn't help but laugh.

He turned and followed Jason out to a table.  "The girls bother you?"

Jason laughed, "No man.  Those are some mean bitches if you let them get your hooks into you."

Nox smiled, "Nothing they can say or do that I ain't had done to me already."

J shook his head, "Yeah but I ain't you.  And Mia would kill me if they started spreading untrue rumors."

Nox nodded, "Ah.  Mia is the reason.  No flirting for you?"

J shook his head, "It's best not to tempt fate."

Nox glanced at his tray.  Bacon, eggs, extra toast and two cups of coffee sat neatly arranged on his tray.  One of the cups was even safely stored in a to-go cup.  He had always liked Ms. Sheila.  J was busy shoveling food into his face.  Nox ate slowly, taking in everything that he'd forgotten about the place.  He noticed whispered conversations as people looked at him and J.  Nox sighed, "Things never change."

J looked up from his plate with a piece of toast he was taking a bite of and glanced around, "You are hot news.  Kai is making sure everyone knows he doesn't want you here."

Nox nodded, "Like I said, nothing ever changes."  And as if there was some sort of cue that indicated to his former roommate Nox saw Aaron Woolbright walk into the cafeteria at the far end.  He was surrounded by a small group of like-minded boys, Nox couldn't even bring himself to call them men, they still acted like the children they had been before he left.  

Aaron had changed at least physically.  While he'd been big as a teenager, he was much bigger now.  Eyes turned to watch the big black man walk towards Nox and Jason.  Nox's eyes never left the man as he moved towards them.  His baseball cap he wore backwards in the signature colors of the Chicago White Sox only added a charicture of the thug Aaron pretended to be.  Nox couldn't help but laughed softly to himself.  Jason turned around to see who was coming that stirred Nox's humor and the uppending silence.  J frowned, "Come on Nox, let's go.  You don't need his shit."

Nox grinned at his friend, "I'm not running away J.  He doesn't scare me."

J laughed, "No, but he scares me.  Come on."

Nox shook his head, "Sorry man, I'm staying to eat."

J sighed and turned back to his plate, he tried to ignore everything around him.  Aaron had never picked on Jason.  Mostly because Jason had always been bigger.  He'd been stronger as a child too.  Now, Jason had gone soft, gotten married, was having children.  Aaron looked liked he lived in the gym.

When Aaron was standing next to their table Nox grinned up at Aaron, "Hey Aaron.  Long time no see."  It was a pleasant enough greeting, that resulted in the big black man pushing Nox's tray off the table.  Nox managed to save the to-go coffee before it flew past him and crashed into the floor.  Nox laughed, "Well that was uncalled for."

Aaron grabbed Nox by the collar of his shirt and hauled him to his feet with ease.  Nox had Aaron by a solid four inches, Aaron hadn't accounted for that fact.  Now he had to look up to get in Nox's face.  Nox grinned down at him.  "Thanks for the help up, man."

Nox saw the other man's fist ball up before it landed in his stomach.  The blow knocking the wind from his lungs, he would have a nice bruise later.  "No one wants your kind here.  Why don't I show you the door?"

Nox took him a few moments to catch his breath and breathe through the pain that radiated through his diaphram.  Nox straightened back up, "My kind?  You mean handsome, fun and eccentric?"

Aaron punched him again in the stomach and Nox laughed as he did so, every breathe burned as he sputtered out the laughter. But Aaron didn't like that, "Everythings' always a joke to you punk.  I'll wipe that smile off your face."  

Nox grinned at him and took a step back.  Aaron threatened, "Where you going, punk?"  The bigger man started to throw another punch, this time the punch stopped short of Nox's face as Aaron's fist slammed into a wall of air.  "You little mother fucker."

The patterns of fire shifted around Aaron and Nox grinned.  He wrapped the lesser man up in a dome of air and sucked the air from it.  Aaron clutched at his throat choking.  Nox smiled at the man inside the bubble of no-air.  "You want to play games.  Let's see how you do now that I can bend the elements freely out of Dae'lin's mindful eye.  What she gonna do now?  Send me away?  Yeah, that's a punishment.  Away from asshats like you.  Try again, Aaron."  Nox's grin turned dark. "I dare you."  Nox let the pattern go and watched as Aaron sucked in air to catch his breath.  

There was nothing left to do other than collect the debris on the floor and throw it away.  At least he still had a cup of coffee.  There were glares and stares all around as Nox left the cafeteria, but no one said anything or tried to stop him.  Even Jason was oddly quiet.
