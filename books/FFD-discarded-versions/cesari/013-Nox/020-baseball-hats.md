# Baseball Hats

The boy's dorimitory was in an uproar by time the three Venatori hunters reached the double doors that lead to their common room.  Mr. Lance greeted them with a smile.  He'd been with the Academy for more years than any of them had been alive, every boy who stepped into these doors had come under the care of Mr. Lance.  All three of them paid the man his just due.  He was a simple man, he wore faded jeans and a just as faded blue t-shirt underneath a hastely buttoned denim shirt.  He looked almost like he was rustled from his bed only moments ago.

"Do we have to do this?  Now?  We were in the middle of dinner."

Emilio smiled, "It is best that we do it now.  The boys and yourself are welcome to go back to the cafeteria and finish.  It might be better."

Nox chuckled at that, "Would you let someone rummage through your things without your presence?"

Kai nodded, "The boy's right."  He raised his voice.  "We will do this as quickly and as orderly as possible.  Everyone standing outside their rooms.  Do not enter or go in until one of the Venatori are there."

Nox shook his head and sighed.  Kai turned and looked at him, "What?"

Nox gave his father a half smile, "Nothing.  Really."  He couldn't beleive they were doing this.  Eli and Sahara entered through the double doors and Emilio sent them down the right cooridor.  He gave Mr. Lance instructions to send the Videns children down the center cooridor, while they went to the left.

Mr. Lance gave them a master key for each cooridor, Kai promptly took it and headed towards his assigned hall.  Emilio and Nox followed.  

There were about 20 rooms on this hall, and each had at least four boys in them.  It was always the way it was.  There were two orange doors, which could potentiall hold up to four boys each, but likely they held one or two at most.  The orange doors signified fire-starters.  Dangerous untrained children who could and often did start fires without meaning too.  Nox remembered the room himself, he'd been in one for the first month of his stay here at the Academy.  Him and Aaron, in the same room.  The memory was bad that first night.  Poor Mushu.  He'd burnt his favorite toy when Aaron took him from him. 

Kai pushed Nox's shoulder and Nox blinked at him.  "None of us have good memories of those doors.  Get to work."

That was probably the most tolerable that Kai had ever been to Nox, and he could hear the bad memories in Kai's voice as he'd spoken.  He'd had a worse time of it if Nox remembered the files he'd gone through earlier in this whole thing.

Nox opened the first orange door and smiled, it was empty.  He left it open as he walked to the first room that was on his side.  Emilio was hopping between sides of the cooridor, or at least that was the plan.  

The first room had four bunks and all four were perfectly dishevealed from the morning wake up call.  Nox grinned as he looked around.  There were no baseball hats lying around in plain sight.  Nox really wasn't looking forward to trashing someone's room.  So he started looking in the more open spaces at first - under the bed, in drawers and closets.  He used his gift to see if there were any thing being concealed.  He found nothing in the first room.  

They searched the rooms like that until they reached the end of the hallway.  Kai found not one but three White Sox caps.  Nox hadn't found any, either had Emilio.  Nox wondered if the man just had the gift.  Two hats were in the same room, all four boys were taken down to the Venatori conference boys.  The last one was with a boy who had no one in his room with him.  He too was detained.

Nox felt bad for the kids.  None of them were even capable of bending more than one element.  Nox could determine their element at a glance, but no one asked him so he left it be.  

The Vega children found one had and their boys had been detained.  A total of three more boys.  Kai's children had found none.  It made Nox feel slightly better at having found none.

Their search had taken close to two hours to finish, in that time two girls were found by some of Dae'lin's reconosense groups.  There were also a baker's dozen of adult residences that had been found with a White Sox hat in their possessions.  There was no telling how many suspects they had now, the number of adults could vary from two per residence to upwards of six and seven depending on the living situation.  The Venatori adults liked to bunk together as they didn't exactly stay at HQ much.  You never knew who was in town and who was not.  It was going to be a mess.

Nox was starving.  He followed Kai and Emilio down to the Venatori conference area where the suspects were all being questioned.  Nox gave each of them a cursory glance.  There were no Cesari or anyone who could bend more than two elements.  He thought it was ironic that Aaron had made the suspect list.  He chuckled to himself.  Aaron had been from a hick town in Illinois, close to Chicago, and probably a true White Sox fan.  He was likely not the culprit, but everyone there was to be questioned.  Curiously Levi was no where to be seen... 

Nox waited until he saw Dae'lin,  she smiled weakly at him when he caught her looking her direction.  Nox approached with care, "Can I tell you what I think of them?"

Dae'lin nodded, "Please do."

Nox smiled, "None of them are who we are looking for.  None of them can bend more than two elements.  Unless they are working together then I doubt any of them had a hand in this, except unwittingly handing over a package."  Nox shook his head, "I think we are missing something." 

Dae'lin sighed, "Okay.  We still have to question them." Nox's stomach chose that moment to rumble,  "When did you eat last?"

Nox laughed, "Honestly, I've not had a decent meal all day.  Aaron decided my breakfast was not good enough to eat as it landed on the floor.  I had a power bar not long ago."  Nox shook his head, "I know, not good, I got distracted with everything.  I'll go eat now unless you need me?"

Dae'lin nodded, "You've given me your insight I think we are good.  Go eat."  Dae'lin looked at her watch, "Cafeteria is done with dinner, won't be much left I'm sure."

Nox nodded, "Yeah I know.  I'll manage.  Even if that means running to the store to get food to make."

Dae'lin laughed, "I forget you actually like cooking."

Nox smiled, "It's not so much as like as it's a necessity I learned to do so I didn't have to eat in the cafeteria all the time."

Dae'lin gave Nox a small shove in the direction of the door.  "Go eat before your stomach chews its way out of your belly."

Nox laughed as he headed towards his new temporary room.  He wondered how trashed it was.
