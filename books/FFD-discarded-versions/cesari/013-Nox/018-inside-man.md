# Inside Man

Nox got a few feet away from Dorian before Emilio Vega stepped around the corner, his eyes were rimmed in red, his cheeks were stained with tears.  Nox's heart went out to the man.  He stood in front of Nox with a presence that spoke of command.  Nox stopped in front of the distressed man with a questioning look, "Sir?"

Emilio stared at him.  "Come with me."

Nox blinked and looked back at Dorian for any indication of what his father wanted with him, Dorian could only shrug.  Nox sighed and turned back to the patriarch of the Vega family.  He gestured for Emilio to lead the way.

They walked in silence.  Nox following only a half step behind Emilio, he wouldn't give the man the satisfaction of believing he was better than him.  Kia would have outpaced him in spite, this man he did not.  Nox felt lost for words.  "I'm sorry for your loss."

That stopped Emilio.  He turned and looked at Nox.  Nox couldn't tell what emotions flew past the dark eyes of the man that was his father's best friend.  He saw rage and sadness for sure, but there was something else too, something Emilio started to say but stopped and paused again to look at Nox.  Nox felt like he was being assessed like this man was sizing him up for some reason.  He gave the man a wry grin, he was not use to being scrutinized up close and personal.  Emilio nodded, "Thank you."  And then strangely enough he put his arm around Nox's shoulders and started walking.

The walked like that for a few steps before Emilio spoke softly, "Your father..."

Nox stopped him, "No.  I don't want you to defend him.  I don't want to hear how my father is a good man.  Or how he doesn't mean what he says.  He wants nothing to do with me, sir.  I don't want to know.  Please."

Emilio nodded, "Fair enough.  But your father would kill me if I shared my insights with you.  Particularly as he hunts down the culprit as we speak."

Nox shook his head, "So why tell me?  And he knows who it is?"

Emilio opened the door to a security room and stepped inside the monitor lit room.  "No, he doesn't.  He's calling an all-hands Magnus meeting.  Every Mangus in the building to be accounted for.  Anyone not showing up will become a suspect."

Nox sighed, "In-house man?"

Emilio nodded, "My wife would not have opened a package from the mail, not without Dorian taking a look at it first.  She believes his theory, as I hear you do too.  She wouldn't have done so.  Both Kai and I know this, there is no other explanation."

Nox nodded, "It makes sense.  Nick said some kid handed him the package."

Emilio blinked back at Nox, "You saw Nicholas?"

Nox laughed, "Yes.  If Kai finds out Nick can get in deeper with his father."

Emilio nodded, "Yes, but it is you who will pay for it.  Despite their differences, Kai does love Nicholas.  He hates you for many reasons, the least of which has to do with Nicholas' orientation."

Nox shook his head, "Nick said the same thing pretty much.  It's my fault Nick likes guys.  Got it."

Emilio frowned, "Kai is stubborn.  As am I."  Emilio spoke softly to the men watching the monitors and they quickly left the two of them alone in the room with all the monitors.  "You came here to help.  I ask that you help me now."

Nox nodded, "Of course, what do you want me to do?"

Emilio nodded towards the monitors, "Go back through footage of the halls.  See what you can find.  I will try to keep Kai from you after you miss the all-hands call.  There is too much footage for just me to sift through."

Nox sat down at a monitor.  "You want to take in front of your apartments?  Or work?"

Emilio looked sat down in the empty chair and looked at the monitors with a heavy sigh, "I don't think I want to watch it happen."

Nox nodded, "Okay.  I'll do in front of the apartments."  There was little said between them as they started sifting through footage.  As he started scrolling through the footage in front of the Vega's apartment Nox's phone rang, he nearly jumped out of his seat he was concentrating so hard on the screen in front of him.  Nox fumbled for his phone, he didn't glance at the number as he answered, "Hello?"

A chirpy voice chattered at him.  "Uh..Hello?"

Then the noise was cut off, "Sorry, Hey Nox.  Aidan stole the phone."

Nox grinned, "I was a little worried."

Stella laughed, "I got the job.  I can't believe it.  I talked with her for like ten minutes, and then she offered me the job.  There is a dinner meeting tonight, which will determine whether or not I take it I guess.  Apparently there is a lot of information I need to know beforehand."

Nox laughed, it sounded a lot like his life.  "I'm glad you got it.  When do you start?"

"Two weeks."  Stella sounded ecstatic.  "I fly home tomorrow and I'll be back in a week.  They are going to show me places tonight too.  I'm really in shock. I want to celebrate, but I don't think I have time before I fly back home.  Maybe after I get back you can show me around town in celebration."

Emilio cleared his throat and Nox laughed, "Yeah sure.  But right now I can't talk.  I have an important task at hand and my partner in crime here is not liking me talking right now."

"Oh, that's alright.  I have to get ready for dinner and Aidan's things together.  I should have called earlier, but I was so excited I called my Mom and we talked for hours."

Nox laughed, "Sounds like a lot of fun.  Call me when you land tomorrow so I know you got there alright."

"Sure thing.  I'll talk to you tomorrow then."  Stella didn't wait for a goodbye, or anything as the phone call went dead.

Nox sighed.  "Sorry about that."

Emilio turned with a smile, "Girlfriend?"

Nox stared at the monitor going in reverse at double speed, "No.  She's sweet and all, but she's human.  And not exactly the type of girl you go in expecting to leave later."

Emilio paused his feed and turned to Nox, "Why's that?  I've known several humans who have lived with us and been happy."

Nox laughed, "Yeah I know.  Usually it's a female Venatori with a male human.  Shacking up with a female human is rather dangerous, and she already has a child.   can't risk that."

Emilio shook his head and turned back to his screen, "So you'll lead her on and then what?"

"I'm not leading her on.  I've a pretty good feeling she isn't looking for a boyfriend, and she knows my preferences aren't typical.  There is still a stigma in the world, you want your kid near someone who you deem a bad influence."

Emilio laughed, "As if that matters.  Were you influenced by others?  I struggle with Dorian's choices every day.  I am glad that he has decided to take care of  his responsibilities, but I know it doesn't make him happy."

Nox shook his head, "Would it make you happy to have to choose a man to be with?"  It really was the same thing for Dorian.  Nick's words rang in his head, 'at least you like girls'.   At least he liked girls, that was only a minor help in that situation.

Emilio nodded his head and stared at the screen, their conversation ending for the time being as they both watched the screens.  Nox saw Mrs. Vega come home with a package in her hand.  "She got it from someplace before getting home."

"I think we need someone who knows the system better than I do to backtrack,"  Nox added.

Emilio shook his head, "I can do it.  I'm surprised you can't."

Nox laughed, "Oh I can flounder through it.  I'd find the right cameras eventually.  Not my cup of tea, sir.  I'm usually the firepower, not the investigator."

Emilio nodded, "We all have our specialties."  Emilio took the controls and started following his wife backwards through her journey.  It was just as tedious as finding something in one stream.  Now they were jumping from camera to camera.  And having to monitor adjoining ones.  Thankfully the system kept all the feeds in sync so they weren't searching for all the right camera angles at different times.

After an hour of combing through Mrs. Vega's  travel during the day, they found her taking a package from a kid in a black White Sox baseball cap with silver embroidery.  "We have our inside man.  Though you never see his face because of that baseball cap."   It felt like a weight had been lifted.  Nox asked, "Where was Nick found?  Is there still footage we can see?"

Emilio nodded, "We looked.  Same hat.  Kai is going to want to do a sweep of every room."

"Sounds like it's the best bet.  I think the mailroom is safe.  If you'd said that before instead of keeping me in the dark, I might not have had my father up in my face."  It was a mild joke and Emilio took it as such if his soft chuckle was anything to go by.

"You are perhaps right.  Let's go find Kai."  Nox sighed and nodded, he'd go with Emilio to find his father and they'd have it out one way or another he supposed.
