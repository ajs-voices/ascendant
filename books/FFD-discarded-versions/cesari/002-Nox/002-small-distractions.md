# Small Distractions

If Dae'lin hadn't wanted him there as soon as possible Nox would have taken the bus or the train to get back to New York City.  But she said as soon as possible, which in her words meant now and not later.  Excuses like fear of flying were not tolerated.  Excuses themselves were not tolerated by Dae'lin at all.

Nox had managed to keep his composure getting on the plane.  There was no prying off of his mother like the first time he'd left from the same airport.  He was not hysterically crying, though he could feel the tension inside spiking each time he heard the rev of the planes engines.

Finally they called for his row and Nox walked calmly to his seat - an aisle seat.  He got his ear buds from the small pocket on his bag and pushed it up into the overhead bin.  Nox helped the little old lady with her bags in the row behind him, and a few other shorter ladies.  They all smiled at him like he was the best thing since sliced bread.  His height was a certain advantage, though he hunched over as he let a large man pass.  

The seat next to him was occupied by a cute red headed woman with a toddler.  She looked at Nox with concern in her hazel green eyes as he sat down next to her.  "Are you sure you don't want the window seat?"

Nox lied, "No, ma'am, I'm more comfortable with the aisle."  He stretched his legs out to indicate his height, she smiled back at him believing his lie.  Nox put the headset cord around his neck and focused on his breathing, the music wouldn't help until after take off.

The woman next to Nox tried to console the child, he squirmed and squealed and was just plain all over the place.  The woman was clearly tired and when the child squirmed free of her grasp and crawled on top of Nox she was appalled by the child's behavior, immediately scooping the little tike off of Nox's lap, "I'm so sorry."

Nox grinned, "It's all good.  I don't mind."

She shrugged and hung her head, "You likely will by the end of it."

Nox laughed, "Doubt it.  Seems like a perfect distraction to me."

The stewardess came over the intercom and gave her instructions.  The woman next to Nox held on to the toddler who refused to stay seated.  He kept trying to play with Nox's ear buds that hung around his neck.  Nox smiled, "It's okay.  You are sitting right here, the plane's all closed up I'm not going anywhere.  He can't hurt the ear buds, or me.  And he'll keep me occupied while we take off."

The woman looked wary, but she left her son crawling on Nox.  He promptly sat down in his lap and picked up the ear buds and started to put them to his mouth.  Nox put his hand in front of his mouth and frowned, "No they go in your ears, not your mouth."  

The boy frowned at him.  Nox pointed to his ears.  "Ears.  Watch."  Nox showed him how the ear buds were used and put the other one to the boy's ear.

The flight started moving and Nox suppressed the slight panic that threatened to overwhelm him.  Kids could sense when you were afraid and reacted in one of two ways, they freaked out themselves or they pushed your buttons.  And Nox didn't need either.

Nox focused on breathing and entertaining his new little friend.  "My name is Nox, by the way."

The woman next to him smiled, "Stella.  And this is Aidan."

Nox grinned, "Pleasure."  He turned back to Aidan.  "When we get going, I'll show you what they really do."  

Before they knew it they were flying high in the air and Aidan was fussing about his ears.  Nox would fuss too if he didn't understand.  And he had the first trip through.  Nox put in one ear bud and gave the other to his little friend as he hunted something suitable on his phone for a kid.  He didn't have much, though there were some interesting instrumentals on there someone in the boonies had gotten him into - cellos and violins and other instruments remaking old tunes and even some new ones.  They were all pretty cool and he set them to listen on very low volumes.

Aidan started to get sleepy and curled up in his mother's lap with a bottle slipped off into a slumber that Nox wished he could achieve.  He put on the other ear bud and drifted, Stella spoke softly, "What takes you to New York?"

Nox smiled, "Been called home.  Boss says 'come' so I heed."

She nodded, "My mother set up a job interview for me forgetting that I had no one to watch Aidan.  Thankfully the place offered daycare for him while I went on the interview."

Nox nodded, "Sounds like a good place to work."

Stella smiled, "We'll see.  Do you like what you do?"

Nox grinned, "I love my job.  Travel the world, meet new people."

Nox knew what the next question was before she asked it, "What exactly do you do?" she asked.

Nox laughed softly.  "I'm a security consultant."

Stella looked at him in disbelief, "You look too young to be a consultant of anything."

Nox grinned, "I had a very good teacher.  And a job underneath her the moment I graduated."

"Her?"  Stella sounded surprised.

Nox nodded, "Her.  She was my private mentor growing up.  So she taught me what she knew, what I needed to know to do my job on top of making sure I went to class and learned all the other things I needed to make my life prosperous."

"Sounds hokey to me." 

Nox laughed, "Private schools have that luxury I suppose."

"A wealthy brat then?"

Nox shook his head, "No, scholarship kid.  Brought in because my mother couldn't handle me anymore.  So they paid my way through so someone could put my head on straight."  It was a lie they all told.   They didn't go to a traditional school, they learned like any other kid, but their lessons were tailored differently, their schedule was very tight, but what their school still was ranked one of the highest in the nation.

Stella laughed, "You don't look like you were a troubled child."

Nox grinned at her with a wink, "Looks can be deceiving, Duckling."

A mischievous grin split Stella's lips, "Duckling?"

Chuckling mostly to himself, it wasn't the first time Nox had to explain Duckling to a woman, "Soft.  Cute...."  

She laughed, "And?"

Nox grinned, "In need of protecting.  It's what I call most women."

"Most?"

Nox laughed, "Dae'lin would kill me if I called her Duckling."

"Your mentor/boss?"  She asked rhetorically.

Nox grinned, "How'd ya guess?"

She grinned, "Just lucky I guess.  You like her?"

Nox shrugged, "She's a good woman.  I look up to her."

Stella laughed, "Now you are being coy.  You know that's not what I meant."

Nox grinned, "Are you asking me if I'm attracted to her and that's the reason I don't call her Duckling?"

She nodded and Nox shook his head, "She's a beautiful woman.  But she'd kill me if I thought of her as anything more than at most my friend.  She went ballistic when she caught me kissing someone in the halls.  Granted I'm sure it was for more than one reason."

Stella laughed, "And those reason are?"

Nox shook his head, "Boy you sure want to get personal.  We worked together, he was a lab partner of sorts.  She frowns upon work place relationships."

The color rose from her cheeks to her ears and down her neck as she blushed, "He? Oh. I thought..."

Nox grinned, "That I was flirting?  I am and you are not incorrect in your assessment of things."  Nox leaned in and whispered, "I am fond of both genders.  Though my preferences lie heavily on the female side of things.  And it's not something I usually lead with."

Stella giggled, "I am sorry though, I thought my radar was way off.  I've not met anyone since having Aidan.  Life has been too busy."

Nox laughed.  "No apologies necessary.  Your radar is just fine."

The plane dipped for it's final decent and Nox was caught of guard, his breath caught in his throat and Nox's hands flew to the arm rests with a death grip.  It was a fleeting moment of panic which Nox suppressed. 

Stella pulled her hand from under his and grinned, "Not a fan of flying?"

Nox blushed slightly, "Not a fan, is an understatement.  My first flight was alone, I was pried from my mother's leg crying with silent sobs as they dragged me to sit alone and afraid going to my new home to be taught how to control myself.  It is not a good memory.  And then when I landed the man picking me up was late.  I thank the lord every day that it had been Dorian and not some sleaze bag who took me home."

The doors opened and people starting pulling their things from the overhead bins.  Nox was called to help others with their luggage.  He helped willingly as Stella and Aidan slipped off the plane.  Damn!  So much for that, he thought to himself.

Nox finally was able to unload from the plane, the stewardess thanking him for his assistance to which he could only grin back in response.  He was relieved to be off the plane, but he wouldn't be fine until he was on solid ground again.

Once outside Nox found himself relaxing and taking a seat in one of the available chairs until he readjusted to the relief.  A person stopped in front of him shifting the weight of a toddler on her hip.  Nox looked up and saw Stella smiling down at him.  "Maybe we can get some dinner tonight?"

Nox laughed, "Isn't that my line?"

She smiled, "Not this time... Duckling."

Nox grinned, "Love to."  Nox pulled a nondescript card from his inside coat pocket, "Call me when you are free.  I'll have to shift things I'm sure.  Dinner will likely have to be late.  f that's okay?"

Stella smiled, "That's fine if you can get me a babysitter after 7 pm."

Nox grinned, "How bout I just bring the food to you.  That way you don't have to worry about the timing?"

She nodded and planted a chaste kiss on his cheek, "Sound good.  Very thoughtful."

Nox laughed, "And here I am giving you impressions I might not live up to."  He grinned at her.  "Call me when you are free and we'll make arrangements then.  I'll know more once I see Dae'lin."

Stella nodded, "See you tonight then." 

Nox watched Stella leave.  That was unexpected.
