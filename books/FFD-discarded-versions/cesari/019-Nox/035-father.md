# Father

Nox woke up on the other side of the bed with Dorian at his back with his arm over Nox's waist.  Nox smiled, it had been a while since he'd actually slept through the night, exhaustion does that; the sun was peaking it's head through the full length curtains of Dorian's room.  He hadn't meant to sleep so long.

Nox rolled over and Dorian mumbled something in his sleep, the other man had even fewer nighttime guests than Nox, at least in his own by bed by his own admission.  Nox entwined his fingers in Dorian's and lifted them to his lips and kissed them softly.  A soft whisper of a moan left Dorian's mouth as a smile spread on his lips.  Nox leaned over and kissed him softly.

Dorian's eyes were squinting at him in the dim light.  "Go back to bed."

Nox laughed, "I'm going to go see Kai.  I didn't want to just leave.  Mind if I grab a shower and a clean shirt?"

Dorian humphed and pulled the blankets over his head with a wave of his hand.  "Yeah, go."

Nox couldn't help but chuckle as he got out of the bed and padded his way to Dorian's drawers looking for a t-shirt, preferrably not white.  He found a few that could work, nothing were exactly his typical shirt, but the red shirt he found in Dorian's drawer would work just fine.

In the bathroom he found clean towels that smelled like Dorian.  He lifted the t-shirt to his nose and it smelt like Dorian too.  He was going to have a hard time concentrating today it seemed.  Even the shampoo and soap smelled like Dorian, he wasn't likely to forget where he'd been last night, even if he had wanted to.  

By the time Nox was dressed and walking back into Dorian's bedroom, Dorian was laying in bed, his head no longer covered and he blinked blearily at the ceiling.  He saw Nox walk in and smiled, "I thought I was dreaming.  You did shower and are wearing my shirt."

Nox grinned and sat down next to Dorian on the edge of the bed.  "Yes.  I'm going up to see Kai."

Dorian looked at the clock on the night stand, "It's only 7.  Come back to bed."

Nox laughed, "I've already slept too much.  I need to get moving."  Nox leaned down and kissed Dorian.  "You want some coffee before I go?"

Dorian pulled Nox into a kiss and Nox almost wanted to crawl back in bed and take this to the next level.  But they still had things in the air, not between them, just things.  Nox sighed as he pulled away, he whispered, "Oh how I wish I could stay."

Dorian grinned evilly up at him, "You can.  All you have to do is let me keep you here."

"Heh.  Yeah.  I really should go see Kai.  Coffee?"

Dorian sighed, "Yes, if that's all I get for putting up with you last night."  He grinned playfully at Nox and pushed him off the bed.

Nox laughed, "Alright.  I'll start a pot and stick around for a cup before I jet."

Dorian nodded, "Bring me a cup please?"  He pleaded softly.  dorian looked too comfortable. but Nox nodded anyway.

He was getting to know Dorian's kitchen pretty well, he made coffee and was soon walking back with an almost too hot cup to Dorian.  He was sitting up in bed and Nox almost lost a beat when he walked in seeing Dorian disheveled and all spost sleep grooming.  He almost giggled at the thought of Dorian being a mess.  But he didn't but Dorian saw the look on his face and threw a pillow at him.

"Careful you'll spill the coffee all over me, and your pretty floors."  Nox chided him.

Dorian grinned, "Can't ruin the coffee now can we."

Nox shook his head and set the coffee on the night stand and leaned over and kissed Dorian one last time.  Dorian pulled him closer and Nox found himself sitting half in Dorian's lap.  Dorian whispered, "I'd like more too."

Nox leaned back and looked at Dorian and what he was saying he smiled.  "We'll get there.  I'll see you later? Lunch?"

Dorian nodded, "Sounds good, or we can postpone it till dinner again."

Nox poked Dorian as he stood up, "You just want me in your bed again."

Dorian blushed slightly, the red barely coloring his ears, "I'd like that a lot."

Nox smiled, "We'll see.  Dinner is good for me."  Nox turned and left Dorian in bed with his coffee.  He grabbed his and went up to the Infirmary.  Nox thought he'd be alone this early in the morning, but from the looks of it'd been the only one to go home.  Iris and her husband were sitting in a chair talking softly.  Nox sighed as he saw Adam and Tobias and Marius all curled up on the floor with the little ones, their significant others if they had them were no where to be seen.  There were kids sprawled out on chairs too.

Iris patted the seat next to her.  Nox sat down, "No one left did they?"

She smiled and shook her head, "No.  I wasn't trying to get you to leave, honest."

"It's alright.  I had a good night."  He reassured her with a smile.

"You look better now.  Killing someone isn't very easy.  I've seen Father come home and he's always a little more brusque than usual."  Iris put her hand on his knee.  "I'm glad you and he are mending some fences."

Nox grinned at her, "Me too."

"Really?"  She really did sound surprised, "I would have thought the way the two of you acted that it was going to be a hard fought war."

"Still hard fought, but things like this tend to give you a little perspective.  Dorian lost his mother.  If Kai had died, if he does die, there's a a lot of missed oppurtunities."  Iris nodded and squeezed Nox's knee.  They sat in silence waiting for news.  Or for the kids to all wake up and start with their noise and energy.  None of which the adults seemed ready for.

As the first of the children roused from their slumbers Nox saw Dorian and Emilio standing in the door to the waiting room.   Both men dressed to the nines, in their typical suit and tie attire, they were two peas in a pod even if they never thought so themselves.  Nox gave Dorian a lazy smile and bit his bottom lip.  

Emilio spoke loudly, it woke the remaining sleeping heads, "Come on the lot of you.  Me and my family are taking you all out to breakfast.  There is no reason for you all to eat hospital food for yet another meal."

Iris stood up and herded her children, Nate included out the door and looked to Nox, "You go on, I ate before I came up."

Everyone filed out of the room following the senior Vega's orders.  Dorian slipped in as the last one came in, "You lied?"

Nox smiled, "No, and yes.  I did grab a sandwich on the way up but I didnt't actually eat it."

Dorian shook his head, "You will eat?"

Nox nodded, "Yeah, I don't think I'm ready to be part of that yet."

Dorian nodded sympathetically, "I understand.  Why don't you go sit with Kai?"

"I think I will."  Dorian helped Nox stand up and put his hand on the small of his back, slightly guiding him towards Kai's door, Nox smiled, "Thanks Dorian."

His friend nodded back, "Anytime Nox."

Thankfully Kai wasn't hooked up to any major tubes or lines, he looked like he was just sleeping.  Nox pulled a chair over and sat down next to his father.  He stared at the man who had been the cause of much of his ire the past three years.  The jut of his nose, the dishevealed hair that was atypical of the put-together man that his father was.  Nox wondered if he could be a better man, let Kai into his life without remembering all the things that had pulled them apart the moment they met.  

His first memory of his father was dinner before his Ad Aetatem, his rite of passage into becoming a true Venatori.  He'd barely passed the stupid rules of the breeding program.  He held enough of the genetic markers to skirt him past the stupid testing facility.  But Dae'lin had insured him he'd come out the otherside intact, he was Cesari she said.  He was one of the strongest Cesari they'd seen in centuries.  That fact alone made him genetically viable.  Nox hated this world for that fact.  A kid had enough problems going through life, to have the pressure of being half human and different, good at something most others aren't, an outcast and then to worry about this as an adult, it was torture.  His kids wouldn't see it, if he had any say in the matter, and if that meant leaving the compound for the betterment of his own childen then so be it, everyone else be damned.

His father had come to a fancy restuaruant in the uppety up part of NYC dressed in blue jeans, a navy blue t-shirt and a designer coat.  The look itself was nice, at least Nox thought so, his mother on the other hand gave Kai the raw side of her tongue.  His mother in contrast wore a light pink chiffon dressed that was almost completely see through except for very strategically placed opaque peices of fabric hung.  She'd dressed to impress his father he suspected.  Kai was hardly impressed between the tongue lashing and the woman's attire, he sneared her name, "Leanne".

Nox remembered the look his father gave him when he stood up.  Recognition dawned on his face.  He knew of Nox as a student at the very least, and now Nox understood why, he'd been caught with his son.  Then it was just a look of disappointment.  It was not a look a father should ever give a son, particularly as a first impression.

Nox had stood and offered Kai his hand.  They'd stood the same height by this time.  Identical chocolate brown eyes stared back at him, there was no mistaking the fact that this was his father now that he'd seen him, now that he knew.  Really someone should have seen the resemblence growing up, maybe no one wanted to peice the information together, Kai surely hadn't, and Nox well he was never overly impressed with his parentage.  His mother almost spitting on him when he picked her up at the airport.

Kai sat down without taking Nox's hand.  Nox sat down and His mother had started spewing out false complements to Kai.  Kai ignored them for the greater part of the night.  They never spoke, never looked at each other.  To say it was awkward was being poliet.  

Nox left the encounter wondering what he'd done in the cosmic arena to deserve parents like that.  And now, the very same man lay helpless in the hospital because of some disgruntled mad man bent on erradicating the Videns line.

A small movement caught Nox's eye and he looked at his father's face and saw him watching.  Nox got up and got the cup of ice chips that the nurses kept replentishing as the hours wore on.  He fed Kai a few before sitting down.  

He whispered, he voice barely auidble, "I didn't expect to see you here."

Nox grinned, "Dorian and Emilio took the sleep and food deprived gaggle of family you have to breakfast."

Kai smiled, "And you are neither?"

"Neither sleep deprived or food deprived, no.  I had a few bites of food on my way up.  But my stomach is playing games for far different reasons."  

Kai's smile grew, "I see you didn't exclude yourself as family?"

Nox smiled, "I'm trying.  Iris even spoke to me."

Kai nodded his head, "She would be the one to pull you in.  She's always gotten on to me about you."

Nox shrugged, "It's all in the past."

Kai raised an eyebrow, "Really?"

Nox nodded, "All I can say is I'll try."

Kai waggled a finger at Nox and Nox got up and sat on the edge of the bed.  Kai looked up at him putting his hand on his knee, "As will I."  He looked over in the corner closet, "My coat, there is an envelope, get it for me."

Nox did as asked,  The envelop had a little blodd on the corner and Nox handed it to Kai.  He shook his head, "It's yours.  Sign it and give it to Dae'lin she knows what to do with it."

"Why do you have it?"  Nox was curious as he sat down and opened the envelope and pulled out the multi-sheet document.

"I told you they owned me favors, this was one of them."  He held out his hand catching Nox's attention.  Nox looked up and Kai smiled, "Before you read that, tell me what happened after."

Nox smiled, "A kid found you.  Emilio back tracked and found the man who had stabbed you.  I was in the middle of following a hunch, that turned out to be right.  My little protege, the one that Dorian's been throwing around from person to person lately, he was in on it.  He hurt Nick.  Killed Mrs. Vega. And he let in the man who stabbed you."

Nox sighed, it was all very raw, everything that happened, "We used Levi to get Abraham to come out.  He was the son of an Exuli you exiled.  Emilio shot Levi and Abraham died of a broken neck after I lit him on fire with a fireball that nearly got Emilio.  But I was already moving the man from the knife plunging from Abraham.  One dead, only  dislocated shoulder and a few minor abrasions on our part.  But everyone is safe."

Kai nodded.  Nox pulled out his phone and sent Dorian a text letting him know that Kai was awake.  When he looked up Kai was watching him again.  "You sharing the news?"

Nox nodded, "Figured if I stole more time I'd never hear the end of it."

Kai laughed, but it looked painful, "Yes I'm sure Adam will have pletnty to say when you leave."  Kai nodded towards the document, "You go read that.  And know that I only want to be part of their lives, not run them."

Nox smiled, "You can comment all you like, I would welcome the advice."  Nox looked towards the door then turned back, "And I hope that you'll include me in those activities... Dad."  It was hard saying the words, there was so much raw emotion coursing through Nox at the time.  Kai's smile brightened and Nox nodded, "Yeah, I think I can do that.  Don't expect a Father from me."

Kai laughed, "Dad, will do just fine son."

Nox grinned as he felt tears welling up, he wiped them away before they fell and he gave a single wave as he walked out the door with the contract in his hand, "See ya Dad.  I'll bring you food next time I come up."

Nox heard Kai's parting comment as he reached the nurses station, "Anythings better than hospital food."

"He's awake."  Nox informed the nurse, she nodded and got up to go tend his father.
