# Fire Starters

Nox dumped Levi rather unceramoniously in a chair in a conference room.  It was very unlike him to take on the evil adult type figure.  He had to chuckle at himself for that, he never thought he'd been one of them.  Nox saw Dae'lin in her office, he wasn't overly thrilled to see her right now.  But he'd deal with her violation of his privacy later.

Levi squirmed in his chair.  "Just let me go.  Please."

Nox shook his head.  "Can't.  You are responsible for the attempted murder of Nicholas Hampton, Dorian Vega, and the death of Dolores Vega.  There is no where for you to go.  Be glad that I was the one that found you."

Levi paled at the charages Nox had laid at his feet.  He didn't even bother to disagree or deny them, he knew what he'd done.  "I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt."

"Remorse is good.  But people did get hurt.  You are also an accomplase in the attempted murder of Kai Viddens.  You let the man in who stabbed him didn't you?"

Levi nodded, "I didn't know."  He pleaded with every fiber of his being. Nox almost felt a stab of compassion for the kid.

Nox sighed and sat down in the chair opposite Levi.  "I get that, but what did you think a man bent on revenge was going to do?"  Levi hung his head and Nox could see his body shake with fear and shame.  "Tell me about this man Levi.  Tell me what he's after and why?"

Levi looked up, his eyes were wide with fear and his breath was ragged.  Tear stains trailed down his cheek and Nox felt for the kid, he really did.  "Tell me what happened to you, at least you can tell me that?"

Levi thought for a moment and then nodded.  "My parents... they didn't like you people... they hated you."

Nox nodded, "That is the reason most Exuli have left.  They disagree with our ways.  I don't fault them their beleifs, I have issues of my own.  But I wouldn't resort to killing someone for it."

Levi shook his head, "They wouldn't either.  But it is why they died.  They didn't send me here to learn when I started showing signs of my ability.  You called me a fire-starter."  Nox nodded and Levi continued.  "I was 10 the first time it happened.  We thought I'd learned control, but my parents got mad at me for smoking up after school.  I got angry.  The fire started small, but it was behind me I didn't know, my parents hadn't notice right away.  It was soon out of control.  I got away, but the my parents were trapped.  I watched them die."

Nox's heart went out to the kid.  "That's why you were on the streets.  You could have come to us.  Go to get help somewhere."

Levi shook his head.  "I wasn't going to hurt anyone else, so I stayed on the streets.  A man found me starting fires with the snap of a finger.  The tragedy was good for one thing, I learned control."

Nox nodded, "Tragedy does that or makes it worse, glad it was the first for you."

Levi looked up, "Did you hurt anyone?"

Nox sighed, "Yes.  But it's not quite so simple."

Levi asked in soft voice, "What happened?"

It seemed today was going to be the day he rehashed his worst memory over and over again.  Nox closed his eyes and took a deep breath.  "I was 5 when I sparked.  I started a fire at home and my mother immediately sent me here.  She wasn't going to be responsible for my accidents.  They put me in a fire-starter program, to help me learn to control my emotions or whatever the reason was I sparked.  I sparked when I was afraid.  My instructor found a way the first day to make me afraid.  He was trying all sorts of things, but he raised a hand against me and let the back of his hand smacked me across the cheek.  It left a red mark.  I started a fire, it was a reflex, between him and me.  "

Nox swallowed.  "For the next year, the man who was in charge of my control issues hit me in whatever fashion he felt was necessary to make me spark.  It started off simple, he didn't really enjoy it.  But something changed and he started to like what he was doing.  He liked to use air laced with earth, so there was no tangible evidence that I was being hit.  And since I healed quickly it was usually gone by the next morning so no one was aware of it."

Nox opened his eyes and looked at Levi, "I hadn't sparked in a month of his beating me.  He was 'promoting me' with my final beating, just to make sure he said."  Nox took a deep breath.  "I sparked, on purpose.  It looked like an accident, everyone thinks it was.  But it wasn't.  I wove fire at his feat and let it burn hot and fast until the nylon in his stupid spandex fake jeans caught and started to melt.  The sprinklers and fire alarms went off and I quelled the fire with water.  He survived, his legs burnt.  I smiled at him and he paled.  I told him if he touched me again I'd do it again."

Levi's eyes went wide and he paled and moved back in his chair to get away from Nox.  Nox sighed, "It was wrong to do.  But I was 6, and I was tired of being beaten.  He never touched me again, or another kid for that matter."

"Have you..."  Levi stared at Nox he couldn't even finish his sentence out of fear.

Nox gave him a half grin, "Have I ever killed with my ability?"  Nox nodded, "Not for such reasons as that.  I've killed dragons, demons, vampires and other things with my ability.  Never a human or venatori.  And if I can, I try very hard not to kill the other creatures.  I bring them in, let them have a 'trial' or let someone else be judge, jury and executioner.  I don't want to do that.  I've had my fill of evil acts for the sake of revenge.  But I will defend my life with every tool in my arsenal, and that is usually why I kill."

"Levi please tell me what happened?"  Nox hated sounding like he was beggining, but retailing the worst moments of his life gave him a different perspective on what was going on.

Levi nodded, "A man, his name is Abraham Morgan, he found me.  Taught me more about what I was.  Why people like you should die.  He hated you all, and specifically the two men who his mother claimed dragged her out of the compound kicking and screaming with her child, away from her family and friends all because she broke some arbitrary rule."

Nox sighed, "It may be arbitrary but it's still a rule, did he say which one, or who she was?  Actually it doesn't matter I can look it up.  What happened after he found you?"

Levi leaned back in the chair, he was relaxing a little and Nox wasn't sure that was a good or a bad thing.  "He said I could do things, he said I could make you pay for kicking us out.  I showed him I could make explosives.  I'd been toying with them on the streets to try my hand at robbing things."

Nox sighed, "He put you back on the street?"

Levi nodded, "For a few months.  So I would look ragged and homeless and be less intimating when you brought me in."

Levi sighed, "I didn't expect to meet you.  Everyone else looked on me like I was a disease."

Nox laughed.  "Because you are an oddity.  A highly powerful Magnus who is self taught is even rarer than a cesari.  We generally burn out without training, but you didn't.  You survived for 6 years without an ounce of training.  The Venatori don't like change.  It's why most don't like me either."

"What was your purpose here?"

Levi put his head on the table in front of him, "To take out as many of the Videns and Vegas I could before Abraham came. He told me to take out as many as I could. I didn't want to.  I was starting to like it here.  Mr. Hill was kind to me.  You showed me things I didn't understand.  I didn't want to..."

Nox stood up and called Emilio.  "Hey.  I have a name and a basic plan."

"I'll be done in a few.  This guy is going down."  Emilio hung up.

Nox blew up the picture Emilio had sent him earlier and set his phone on the table in front of Levi, "Is this Abraham?"

Levi nodded, "Yes.  What are you going to do?"

Nox shook his head.  "Something I shouldn't."
