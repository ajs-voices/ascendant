# The Best Laid Plans

Emilio walked into the conference room, for being a man who'd lost his wife, and his best friend's life hung in the balance, Emilio Vega was the epitomy of calm, there was not a hair out of place on his well groomed head of salt and pepper hair.  His suit was pressed and from the looks of the clean lines still at the seams Nox assumed starched too.  He spoke in a soft quiet voice that sent shivers up Nox's spine.  "The boy will help us or I will find he meets an accident."

Nox recalled only one time in which Dorian had used a very similar voice on him.  It made every those fresh memories he'd just told Levi pale in comparison.  But the irony would have it that it was the very same memories that lead to Dorian's voice mirroring his father's.  Dorian had been given the task of handing out his reprimand for putting another's life in danger.  

The memories of sitting in Dorian's cool blue office, the windows open and the smell of cinamon and vanilla floating on the air adrift the mixture of smog and air pollution.  Dorian had only said, "I'm very disappointed."  Nox remembered pleading for a second chance. He'd known from the very first day what it meant if he failed.  He'd met a Tacet once in those early days.  The man was vacant.  He walked and talked but he could barely be called a man.  Nox didn't want to be like that.  As the shiver passed Nox came to with Emilio looking at him with concern.

"Something wrong?"  He asked cautiously.

Nox shook his head, "Memories are raw.  I'm alright.  It won't happen again."  The words rang in his head, he'd remembered saying the same thing to Dorian when he was six years old.  He'd kept that promise.

In the passing of his memories Emilio had formulated a plan with Levi.  Nox didn't exactly know what was going on, his trip down memory lane being the only thing he'd been aware of but he didn't let on, at least not in front of Levi.

They went down cooridors and Nox realized they were heading towards the armory, the only path that would be unrestricted on this floor.  But it was a very specific path.  Levi stood by the door.  Another venatori nodded from the stair well and Nox followed Emilio back the way they'd come.  They were laying an ambush.  Nox watched his direction when Emilio pointed and he watched the boy.

Nox whispered, "Sorry I missed the plan."

Emilio tsked at Nox.  "What happened?"

"You reminded me of Dorian."

Emilio frowned at him, "That looked like fear."

Nox gave a small harsh laugh, "It was.  He has that soft quiet voice when he's angry too.  I've heard it only once in my life and it's still terrifying."

Emilio shook his head, "I find it hard to beleive that Dorian was ever angry at you.  He's always spoken highly of your ability. You being his niche of study after all."  When Nox looked at him quizically Emilio chuckled to himself, "Being Cesari and all."

Nox nodded, he knew that, everything was becoming a muddy mess.  "Let's focus on this.  I can rehas those memories later."  

Emilio didn't get a chance to agree as the door to the stair well opened.  The venator who had been there stepped trough, everything looked normal until Nox noticed the small trickle of blood dripping down the corner of the man's mouth before he fell forward, a steadily growing blosom of blood formed on his shirt and pooled into the ground as a man stood behind him.  "Come out son."  He called down the hall.  And Levi stepped out of the door.

Nox shook his head, they'd played them.  Something in the conversation he'd missed something had transpired that told this man, this Abraham that this was a trap.  

Emilio pulled a gun from his back and Nox knew everything was going to end badly.  The man's rough voice called out to Levi again, "Who we have down there son?"

Levi smiled, it was not a pretty smile, he could see the darkness in his eyes.  "Emilio Vega and the half human son of Kai Videns."

"Half human eh?  Kid, I bet that bothers these hypocrites."  He called out to Nox.  As if the words would entice him to turn traitor.  

A small laugh came from Levi as he started, "He is like us you know.  He tried to kill a man who beat him.  He exacted revenge upon him.  But he's a coward.  He didn't kill him.  He saved him.  Let him live.  I don't think he is worthy to join us.  I'd like to kill him, he's too... perfectly Venatori."

Nox laughed at that, he was not perfectly Venatori.  He was so very far from it.

Emilio stepped out from his corner and Nox sighed, bullets were going to fly.  Things were going to go badly.  Nox watched as patterns formed in front Emilio and there was nothing he could do about half of it.  Nox whispered, "Don't move forward, he'll blow you up."

Emilio gave a slight nod.  Levi smirked as he saw Nox turn the corner.  Levi drew his body up.  Abraham lunged with the knife that had killed the other man.  Emilio fired a few rounds from his gun.  All before Nox could fully comprehend what needed to be done.  But he acted anyway.  Nox wrapped Emilio in air and pulled him from the on coming knife and threw a fireball that barely missed the father of the man he was 'dating'.  

The force of the fireball threw Abraham back on to his back as the flames sucked away at his clothes.  The stench of burning cloth and hair were the first things that came out of the whole mess.  Nox was the only one standing Emilio was leaning against the far wall where Nox had flung him.  There was broken sheet rock from the force of the landing.  Emilio nodded, "Thanks."

Levi's body, Nox blinked as he saw the boys body sliding to the floor leaving a red streak on the white walls.  Nox took a deep breath and used air to break the burning man's neck.  He was going to die anyway, but it didn't have to be completely without mercy.  Nox stood there in a daze completely numb to what had happened.
