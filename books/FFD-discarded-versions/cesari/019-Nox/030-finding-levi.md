# Finding Levi

Nox started wandering the halls, cooridor by cooridor, starting around the boy's dormitory.  Lockdown prevented the boys from leaving their rooms, or whateve room they were in.  Mr. Lance had helped guide Nox to Levi's room.  There was nothing strange, or even any boys present.  Nox wondered why he was all alone in a room.  Closing him off like this hadn't helped matters any.

Mr. Lance asked, "Is he dangerous?"

Nox shrugged, "I don't know.  But I need to find him, talk to him."

Nox was leaving the boy's dormitory when Emilio called, "Nox.  I found the man, the picture is sent to your phone.  Keep on the lookout for him.  I've got a few others up here helping me backtrack this man's movements.  I think you kid is up on the second level residences.  I think I saw a Sox hat move around the corner, but there are no cameras down that hall.  They've been taken out."

Nox sighed.  "Thanks.  Nothing can ever be easy can it."

Emilio added, "Dorian's rooms are down that way."  Nox was about to say something but Emilio continued quickly, "Don't worry about my boy, he's safe in the infirmary looking after everyone.  You do your job, he'll do his."  And then Emilio hung up again.

Nox walked to the stair case and started towards the adult residences, Emilio's guiding hand lead the way until he was on the correct floor and the floor was once again sealed shut.  If Levi were here he'd find him.  But it was the patterns spanning the cooridor that had Nox in a state of awe.  Levi may not see the patterns, or couldn't before.  But he knew how to weave intracate patterns.  Nox didn't know what half of them did, and dismantling them could be harmful.  He didn't have time to take care of them.  Nox walled of the dangerous sections with air and continued moving down each cooridor careful of what he might step into.  Around the corner Nox saw Levi working on Dorian's door.  

Levi looked up and gave Nox an evil grin and then bolted down the hallway, leaving streaks of patterns behind him.  Nox couldn't follow at that speed.  Nox closed his eyes and thought about the layout of the building, of this floor in particular.  Levi was blocking his own path too, so all Nox had to do was corner him.  Every cooridor Nox went down, he checked for unlocked door, and then blocked off the door and the cooridor.  No one would get through until he cleared the pattern.  

A door was unlocked, it was a possiblity.  Nox dropped a sign for Emilio to see where he went, a rock arrow pointing into the cameraless storage room.  He would be virutally alone.  Nox slipped into the door and closed it behind him.  He left a wall of air behind him, noone was going to get out, and noone was going to get behind him and take advantage of it.  It was really the only way he could go into this storage room safely.

There was no light in the room, and Nox didn't want to flip the switch to give his presence away.  But he could create a small flame to at least light his immediate area.  The small flickering light gave off an eerie cast of orange and yellow to the nearby shadows.  If he were afraid of things that go bump in the night this would be the place to be freaking out.  The shadows were creepy, Nox preferred the woods to human made structures.  It is one of those ironies really.  Home was here, he liked it here, but hunting in the city was so much harder.

The room was lined with shelves and there were two additional shelves down the middle.  Nox moved slowly, moved quietly so that he didn't alert anyone to his presence.  Down the aisle he heard a can fall and a muffled noise of surprise.  Nox walked towards the direction of the noise and blocked the aisles as he went through, that ability was going to come in handy in here.  

Nox rounded the corner and saw a small shape huddling in the corner.  He wrapped the person in air and there was a shout of surprise.  "What the fuck!"

Nox sighed, he recognized the voice and sighed, "Levi?"

Levi cried out, "Let me go.  He'll kill me if I don't get back."

Nox walked over and made the flame larger to light more of the area.  "Who and kill you?"

Levi struggled against the bonds, "Just let me go."

Nox shook his head, "Sorry kid.  Why were you running from Dorian's door?"

Levi clamped his mouth shut and shook his head.  

Nox sighed and took his phone from his pocket and let lose all other patterns.  He redailed Kai's number.  "Emilio.  I got him. I'm going to take him to Dae'lin's office.  You want me to come back up there?"

Emilio sighed, "No.  You know him, you speak to him first, maybe he'll talk. Nox, good job.  But don't do that again."

Nox laughed, "Uh, I'll try not to, but can't make any promises, but thank you for your assitance.  Let me know if you find anything and I'll do the same."

"We'll talk later."  Emilio hung up and Nox put his phone away.

Levi struggled against the bonds again, "Please let me go."

"I'm sorry Levi, I can't.  Come on, walk with me.  If you don't try to run we can let the patterns go, but I really need you to come with me.

Levi nodded.  Nox let the air go and Levi collapsed in a heap on the floor.  "Come on.  Talk to me before anyone else gets around.  It'll go better."

"I'm not talking."  Levi tried to bolt and Nox wrapped him back up in air. 

"Levi..."  Nox sighed, "Come on.  Why are you doing this?"

Levi shook his head.  "Alright we will do this the hard way."  Nox took Levi with him, it was not an easy trek.  Levi refused to walk and talk and just about anything voluntary.  So Nox was pretty much dragging him around the compound like a sack of potatoes.  It was hardly becoming.
