# Surprises

Nox wasn't exactly sure what they could do that Dorian would enjoy doing, they hadn't exactly talked about anything like a normal date would have.  He laughed to himself as they walked through the streets of Little Italy.  He was content to walk next to Dorian, their hands brushing as they moved.  Nox couldn't stop smiling, it had been a while since he'd felt this comfortable with someone.

Dorian had wanted to talk patterns, in particular what he saw, so that's what they'd do.  Nox guided them to the nearest subway station and hoped a train back to the compound.  People watching, maybe some jumping, they'd see where the night went.   Dorian didn't ask what was up, he smiled as they got off at the home station.  "Home?"

Nox grinned, "Not for what you think.  You want to talk patterns right?"  Dorian nodded, "What better place than home base to show you what I see."

Dorian shook his head, "Not what I expected ..."

"You expected something more private?"  Nox grinned over at Dorian.

Dorian nodded, "Going home.  Implied a different activity in my head.  I wasn't exactly sure how to navigate that particular connundrum."

Nox laughed, "Not tonight.  Shocking I know."

Dorian chuckled, "To the roof I assume?"  The elevator door closing as they started up the ascent to the roof on Nox's nod of agreement.  The glass box they road in left them open for anyone to view as they rode up and up.  Nox stared at the door ahead of him.  Dorian wrapped an arm around Nox's shoulder and smiled, "This is what I did not like."

Nox laughed, "Can't be helped."  He turned to look at Dorian with a grin, "I am fine though I promise, not going to crumble or collapse in a crying heap or anything."

Dorian smiled, "Good to know."

The doors opened to the top floor, they'd have to take the stairs to the roof.  The door on the roof was propped open and there was a crowd already up there, much more than Nox actually remembered when he lived here.

Nox lead Dorian through the throng to a back corner to sit on a couple of turned over milk crates that went for the only seats away from the edge of the roof.  Dorian kicked the dust off the crate before sitting down, Nox hadn't even noticed, he'd probably have a nice criss-cross pattern on his ass when he got up.

Nox peired into the crowd, he didn't recognize the youngest faces, but the ones his age and older he knew slightly, but there were a lot more people here than he expected.  There was a lot of air benders, but there were alot of people here who didn't bend at all.  That was more curious than anything.  They usually had a few friends who came to see you jump but they seemed to outnumber those who could bend.  Nox commented to Dorian offhandedly, "Seems to be a lot of Scrin and other Venatori here."

Dorian looked around, "You can tell that?"

Nox smiled, "A distinct lack of patterns around them, no pull, no push, just are."

Dorian leaned closer so he could be heard over the drone of the crowd as they cheered on the next jumper.  "Describe the patterns around someone, anyone, just not me."  Dorian smiled, "I don't want you staring at me that intently."

Nox laughed but didn't have a smart come back.  Nox nodded towards the man with his back to them.  "The guy in front of us, the one in the jeans and the Knick's basketball jersey.  He's a water bender.  Water is always hard so probably not a good one to use but he's the easiest to see right now.  The patterns shift like water around him.  Imagine that each element is a color and if I were to paint a static image of him in one percise moment..." Nox used the empty space in front of him and his finger to trace the pattern in the air with a lingering vision of fire. "The lines are exaggerated that I'm drawing but the pattern is the same."  The lines faded quickly as the fire disappated.  

Dorian nodded.  "Okay, they flow around him like water, I think I can see something. It's faint though."

Nox nodded, "It'll get stronger with practice, but the strength in which you see it as well, usually says how strong they are.  I'd peg him around a 3, able to duplicate given a strong source."

A figure stepped out of the shadows and stood in front of Nox and Dorian.  The only thing Nox saw at first was the pair of faded jeans and old canvas converse.  Nox looked up with a grin to see Jason standing in front of them.  "You two having fun?"  Jason yelled, "He's finally here."

Nox stood up, "You waiting on me for something?"

The crowd cheered.  Jason smiled, "Of course.  Rumors flooded the compound when you jumped this morning."

Nox nodded, "That's why there are so many others up here tonight."

Jason laughed, "That and Skylar and Van are throwing their last hurrah!"

Two other's joined Jason, he vaguely remembered them.  Dorian stood up and tried to slip away.  Nox caught his hand before he got more than a step away.  "Wait, please?"

The girl was about Jason's height and sporting a white blond bob with a streak of red running through hair framing her round face.  She smiled at him, "Jump with us.  We've all sorts of stuff for you to play with tonight.  Van and I are going to Basilia in a few days.  We won't have another jump for a long time.  At least we can say our last jump was with you."

Nox laughed, "Like that means anything to anyone."

The man she had her arm wrapped around smiled, "It does to us.  Come on.  Jump."  The crowd around them started cheer "Jump! Jump!"

Nox rolled his eyes.  "Fine.  Give me a moment."  He shooed everyone including Jason away and then turned his attention to Dorian who was chuckling to himself.

"I never knew you were a cult leader."

Nox grinned, "Me either."  He frowned and stepped close to Dorian, "I'm sorry about this."

Dorian shruggd, "It happens.  I expected it when you brought me here."

Nox sighed, "I'm sorry.  We can go.  I don't need to jump."

Dorian shook his head, "No, jump.  Join your friends.  I'll be fine."  Though Dorian didn't sound like he'd be fine.

"No."  Nox smiled and held out his hand to Dorian, "Jump with me."

Dorian blinked back at him, his expression was surpised, Nox couldn't help but laugh.  "I don't think that is a good idea."

Nox smiled and took a step closer and whispered, "Don't trust me?"

Dorian pulled back to look Nox in the eyes, "I trust you.  Just..."

Nox grinned, "Jump with me.  It's 8 seconds of your life."

Dorian laughed, "In which I could splat on the ground and there be nothing left of me."

"I won't let that happen.  I promise.  I won't let you go."  Nox put his hand on Dorian's waist and pulled himself closer to him.  "I won't let you go.  You don't have to do anything but hold on and I'll take you for ride of your life."

Dorian laughed in his ear, "That could be taken so many ways."

Nox was breathless in Dorian's ear, "Yeah."  Nox whispered, "Jump with me?  Please?"  He sounded desparate he realized that, almost like he was begging Dorian to do this with him.  And at that very moment he was.  He'd jumped with Jason before, but it was never like this, he never wanted to share it with him like he did with Dorian at this moment.  He wanted this more than he'd wanted anything else.

Dorian took a step back and looked at Nox.  Nox couldn't imagine what he was looking for, or what he saw in him, but he smiled and nodded, "Alright."

Nox was surprised he relented.  Nox leaned forward and kissed Dorian with thanks and the need he was feeling.  He whispered in a heavy voice, "Thank you."

Without letting anything else stop Nox took Dorian's hand and lead him towards the jumping area.  The crowd parted like he was Moses parting the red sea.  Dorian trailed along close on his heels but no one bothered him.  Nox met Van and Skylar at the jump site and they smiled at hSim.  The waved their hands over the boxes of party favors.  There were streamers and water pistols, small caches of confetti and a billion other things to flutter in the air as they jumped.   There was going to be a huge mess to clean in the morning.

Van handed Nox a bushel of fireworks and Nox laughed, "That's what you want me to do?"  The bigger man nodded with a wide smile splayed across his wide face.

Skylar held out her hand to Dorian, "You jumping with us?  Skylar.  This is Van."  She looked at Dorian questioning who he was.

Dorian took her hand softly in his and smiled, "Dorian.  Yes, Nox is rather persuasive."

Van clapped Dorian on the back, "Glad to have you Dorian.  I'm surprised you are here with all that's going on."

Nox smiled, "Let's take his mind off all that."

Van nodded and let out a holler that nearly deafened Nox.  Dorian took a step back.  Nox could tell he wasn't enjoying the moment.  "Let's get this done."

Nox turned to Dorian and smiled hopefully, "Still in?"  Dorian nodded with a sigh, "We can do this in a few ways.  You can just hold my hand and I'll expand my patterns to you.  You can hold on to me or we can be harnessed together.  The choice is yours."

Dorian stepped in, "Rather intimate in front of others?"

Nox grinned, "Doesn't have to be.  The first and the latter are less intimate.  The middle one I can't do anything about the intamicy factor.  We can do this like anyone's first jump.  No intamcy, I promise."

Dorian nodded, "I think that would be the most comfortable situation for me.  This is all very... different."

Nox grabbed a harness from the bin and handed it to Dorian.  Dorian looked at him with a plea for help.  "If I put it on for you, it looks intimate."

Dorian sighed, "Please?" 

Nox smiled and whispered, "Of course."  Nox helped Dorian put the harness on.  It looked more complicated than it really was and Dorian thanked him shyly.  

Nox put a similar strap on himself and to his surprise Van and Skylar were strapped together.  Nox took a second look at the couple and grinned widely, "Van can't bend air?"

Skylar looked at him with surprise, "Yeah, how'd you know?"

Dorian smiled, "It's one of his many gifts."  He leaned into Nox's back and whispered, "I don't feel so out of place now."

Nox laughed.  Nox helped Dorian up to the edge and Nox stood behind him and latched the harness together.  He leaned in to whisper careful to maintain a proper distance, "You okay?"

Dorian looked down and laughed uneasily, "Sure."

Nox smiled, "I will lead.  You will fill a tug on the harness.  Don't struggle, let me take you with me."

Dorian looked over at Van and Skylar and Nox could feel the tension in his body rise.  "You don't have to do this Dorian."

"I know.  I don't think I can... not this way."

Nox laughed and unhitched the clasp holding them together.  Dorian turned around and smiled, there was fear in his eyes, but he leaned in and Nox could smell the vanilla and cinamon at that distance.  Dorian whispered, "Fuck what others say."  He reached between the two and clipped the harnesses together.

Nox smiled, "You sure?"

Dorian nodded, his eyes never leaving Nox's.  "Do you want to look while we fall or do you want to watch up?  Whatever you feel comfortable with Dorian."

Dorian frowned, "What about you?"

Nox laughed, "I'll be fine."

Dorian sighed, "I don't want to watch the ground get closer."

"Okay.  You need to lead.  When you are ready just fall backwards.  I'll do the rest."  Dorian nodded, "Are you ready?"  He nodded again and Nox looked over at Van and Skylar.  Skylar was facing him and Nox nodded to her and mouthed, 'We are ready."

She smiled and held up her hands, with a count of 3.  Nox nodded, and they held their hands up and the crowd started counting down. 3.... 2... 1... And Dorian closed his eyes and fell backwards.  Nox did three things all at the same time.  First he threw the fireworks high into the sky a thread of fire trailing after them.  He pushed off with his feet and they sailed into the middle of the alley on small wings of air that he'd wrapped around them, and he cast a wide net beneath them on the ground to soften not only their fall but Van and Skylar's.  

Dorian's breath caught and his eyes were closed and Nox leaned his forehead against the other mans for a moment before he pulled back so they didn't crack heads when they landed.  It was 8 seconds of adreanaline.  8 seconds from the jump to the ground below.  In those 8 seconds Nox heard the fireworks above him sparkle and shine, Dorian's eyes popped open quickly in panic before he realized what had happened. The air around them hugged them, and Nox could feel the harness digging into his body from below as his weight was shoved into Dorian's body the air slowing Dorian's decent enough that gravty worked against him, pinning Dorian in nothingness.

They landed in a heap and Dorian gasped for air.  Nox took a deep breath, it was 8 seconds he'd been holding in.  Nox rolled over forgetting Dorian was attached to him.  Dorian's weight stopping him from landing on his back.  He laughed softly and put his forehead against Dorian's and smiled, "You okay?"

Dorian nodded unable to speak.  Nox heard Van and Skylar laughing near hysterics.  They had enjoyed their jump.  Nox reached his hand between them and unhooked the harness and laid back on the ground to catch his breath.  Dorian stayd on his side and leaned on his elbow watching Nox.  He grinned over at Dorian.  "Well?"

Dorian sighed, "I'd say it was interesting watching you form the patterns but I had my eyes closed the whole time."

Nox smiled, "I know."

Nox sat up, "We need to move."  He stood up and offered Dorian a hand which the other man took with a smile.  Dorian stood up and fell against Nox slightly.  "Balance off?"

Dorian just grinned at him as he stood on his own two feet and wrapped his arm aroud Nox's waist and tugged at him walking towards the alley where the door stood propped open.  Van and Skylar waited just a few steps inside.

Van clapped Dorian on the shoulder again, "How was your first jump D-man?"

Dorian chuckled, "I'll let you know tomorrow."

Skylar laughed and Van nodded knowingly, "Nothing like being at someone else's mercy is it?"

Dorian shook his head, "I suppose that's one way to look at it."

"My first jump wasn't with Skylar, I had some prick of a guy who made me piss my pants.  Least your guy here was careful, I've heard he can be a real prick about it too."

Nox laughed, "That's only a rumor.  I've never ever scared someone doing this.  I'm the least scarey of you lot.  J started it so that people wouldn't be clamouring to have me jump with them."

Skylar laughed, "Well it works."

Nox nodded, "I know."  He grinned.

"Thanks man, that was awesome.  We really appreciate it.  Sorry to intrude on your date."  Skylar sounded sincere and both Dorian and Nox laughed as they watched the other couple walk up the stairs to head back up to their party.

Nox turned to Dorian in the stair well and smiled, "Our date... So do you want to go back up, or go someplace else?"

Dorian laughed, "I think I've had enough heights for one day."  He tugged Nox up the stairs and Nox followed.  "Something a little more calm and peaceful and less people."

Nox laughed, "What did you have in mind?"

Dorian smiled, "A movie, popcorn, something tame."  Nox chuckled.  They rounded the first bend of the stairs and Dorian asked, "It was important for me to jump with you, wasn't it?"

Nox could feel the blood rush to his ears, "Yeah.  Had a very strong urge to share something I love with you once it presented itself to us."

Dorian smiled, "And now?"

Nox laughed, "And now, I'm happy to relax with you."
