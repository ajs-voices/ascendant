# Down Time

Dorian took them to his place.  It was not the same level has his parents, and it wasn't on the same floor as Nox's current residence, he was somewhere in between.  Which was impressive in itself.  Nox was impressed with Dorian's place the moment he opened the door.  The floor was large gray slate tiles, the walls were white except for the accent wall of wood that was a bookshelf and tv stand all in one.  The bookshelf had a few decorative books, glass sculptures and other elegant looking figurines.  Nox almost didn't want to touch anything.  The furniture was all modern sleek lines in whites and greys, in the middle of the room a white long shag rug was the situated under a low black coffee table.  The two couches and an ottoman surrounded the table. 

Nox gave a long whistle of appreciation.  "Sweet digs."  The kitchen was open, it sported the only color, a deep blood red accent on the bar stools and light fixtures hanging from the ceiling above the bar.  The same color vases and other small items were placed strategcially around the kitchen which was otherwise white and grey with stainless steel appliances.

Dorian was in the kitchen opening a cupboard and pulling out a few things, he was true to his word, popcorn, and of course he was opening a bottle of wine while the popcorn steadily popped in the microwave.  

When the popcorn was decidedly done popping Dorian opened the microwave door and poured the bag into a glass bowl and sat it on the bar.  He looked up at Nox and smiled, "Show you the rest?"  Nox nodded he didn't trust his voice.  Dorian had the money he had spent on him earlier, and then some.  That was a good and bad thing Nox thought to himself.

Dorian lead them down a short hallway and opened the door the bathroom, It was elegant too, white with gold accents on everything including the faucets, it was only a half bath.  The only other door in the hallway lead to his bedroom.  Dorian opened the door and Nox took in the difference of sceneary.  Instead of the blacks, greys and whites with little color as everything else the walls of Dorian's room were painted a deep blue, the floor was the same through out the house, all grey tiles made of slate, the bed was dressed in white except for the accent pillows, Nox was fairly certain that the sheets underneath the white comforter would match the walls.

Nox smiled, "I didn't expect this."

Dorian laughed, "Few see my room.  Few get to see the difference."

Nox leaned into Dorian as he wrapped his arms around Dorian's waist, "The playful and colorful side?"

"Something like that."  Dorian brushed his lips against Nox's, "Don't go ruining my reputation now."

Nox laughed and kissed Dorian roughly then walked past him, "I think we tarnished that rep when you jumped with me."  He joked playfully.

Dorian followed him back towards the living space shutting his door behind him.  "What would you like to watch?"

Nox shook his head as he grabbed the bowl of popcorn and a glass of wine, Dorian picked up his glass and the bottle.  Nox sat down on the couch in front of the tv, "I haven't seen anything recently.  What do you have?"

Dorian grabbed the remote from the table and turned on the TV and smashed a few buttons and his XBox One pulled up his list of downloaded movies.  Nox wondered if Dorian had purchased them all, he laughed and Dorian turned a questioning look on him.  Nox grinned, "Was just wondering if you'd illegally downloaded these movies."

Dorian laughed, "Oh you know me."  

Nox grinned and pushed Dorian with his shoulder, "That's why I laughed, it was such a proposterous thought.  Jason, yes... you, nah."

Dorian smiled as he ran through the list of movies.  Nox sighed, "That one.  I've not see it."  

Dorian nodded, "Good choice.  Fun and heroic."

Nox laughed, "And it has a cute raccoon in it."  Dorian laughed as he pushed play and the lights in the room dimmed until they were out.  "Ain't that a sweet trick.  I bet you use it on all the guys."

Dorian smiled, "I typically don't bring them home and I don't think those that I might have would have been so easily impressed with the dimming feature."

Nox laughed, "I've simple tastes, what can I say."  Nox leaned into Dorian and Dorian turned to accomodate his presence wrapping an arm around him against the back of the couch.  They watched Guardian's of the Galaxy in each others embrace, forgetting about the world around them, the bomber who was taking out Videns and Vegas alike.  About the possible traitor in their building.  It was just them.  

When the movie finished Nox was sleepy, but Dorian scrolled through movies and threw on something that looked halfway decent, Nox barely registered what it was before he was passed out leaning against Dorian.  Nox woke up alone on the couch, a blue blanket drapped over him and his shoes removed.  

Nox sat up and found his cell phone lying on the table next to him.  It was 5 in the morning and Dorian was no where to be found.  Nox went to the bathroom and notice Dorian's door was open slightly, he peeked inside and saw Dorian lying in bed under the satiny blue sheets he'd predicted were under the comforter.  It was the least put together Nox had ever seen Dorian, his hair dishevealed, he could have sworn that Dorian was drooling into his pillow.

After finisheing cleaning up with what he could in the half bath full of gold and white Nox went into the kitchen and opened each cupboard looking for coffee.  Nox threw on his ear buds and turned on a good wake up beat and continued his search for breakfast.  He shook his head when he found an expensive brand unground.  More things to look for...

Nox eventually ground the beans and was in heaven by the time that he had a pot brewing.  He pulled out what he could find in the fridge to make breakfast.  Nox had started making eggs by the time the coffee started making the room smell heavenly.  Nox was half dancing, half cooking when he looked up and saw Dorian watching him with a grin as he ran his fingers through his hair.  Nox bit his bottom lip as he looked Dorian over.  He didn't have a shirt on and was wearing a pair of blue boxers, Nox hadn't known Dorian had a tattoo covering half of his body, the tribal flames running from just under his collar bone over his shoulder, down his left arm and chest past his waist band on his boxers.  The eggs started to complain as he looked at Dorian and Nox snapped his attention back to the food before it got out of hand.  

Dorian sat down at the bar and continued to watch Nox as he moved around Dorian's kitchen with little assistance.  Nox made two plates and poured two cups of coffee and set one in front of Dorian before he turned off the music in his ears and sat down next to Dorian.

Dorian was taking a careful sip of his coffee then he smiled at Nox, "No one's ever made me breakfast before."

Nox leaned over and pushed Dorian with his shoulder, "That's because you never have anyone over, remember?"

Dorian laughed, "I'm glad you made yourself at home."

Nox smiled, "I was hungry, and I didn't just want to leave without saying anything."

"Well thank you for staying and for breakfast."  Dorian took a few more bites before he added, "I would have invited you back to bed, but you were asleep and I didn't want to wake you."

Nox smiled, "It's alright, if I'd been awake I'd probably not have gone.  That would lead to other things that I told you wouldn't happen last night."

Dorian frowned with mock disappointment, "And I had been so looking forward to turning you down."

Nox laughed, "I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances."

They finished eating in relative silence.  Dorian took the plates and coffee cups and placed them in the sink and started running the water to wash them.  Nox intervened, "I made the mess I'll clean it up."

Dorian held his hands up, "By all means.  Do I get to watch you dance around while you do that too?"

Nox laughed, "If you want me too."

Dorian sat down at the bar with another cup of coffee, "I think I'd like that."

Nox grinned and pulled his ear buds out and started the music again and started cleaning up.  He tried to ignore the fact that Dorian was watching his every move.  He was soon lost in the familiar actions of washing dishes and drying them before putting them away.  It was a strange kitchen but it was still a familiar task and he enjoyed the menail labor.

When Nox had finished Dorian was sitting watching him with a grin.  Nox smiled at him, "I should go grab a shower and change clothes, I should probably get back to work."  Nox turned the music off and pulled the ear buds from his ears and drapped the cord around his neck as he walked around the bar to stand next to Dorian.

Dorian looked up at him from the barstool with a smile.  "Yeah.  I have work to do myself."  Dorian grabbed the front of Nox's shirt and pulled him close as he stood up.  They were as close as two people could get without sharing the same space, Nox shuddered and sighed softly as he pressed his body against Dorian.  Dorian leaned in and kissed Nox softly.  Nox put one hand on Dorian's hip and the other caressed his cheek and ran his fingers through Dorian's soft hair.  They parted breathless and Dorian smiled at him, "Thank you for spending the night with me.  I appreciate it."

Nox could hardy speak, he whispered with a heavy voice, "You are welcome.  Anytime."  Nox found it difficult to pull away but he did, "I'll see you later."  He winked at Dorian and Dorian walked with him to the door.  Nox kissed Dorian again as he opened the door and winked at him, "We'll have to do this again."

There was a woman standing outside her door when Nox left and he grinned at her, she stared at him as he past her, Nox turned around and walked backwards a few steps, Dorian watched him and the woman stared incredulously at Dorian like he was an alien.  Nox laughed softly and gave Dorian a small florished bow before he turned around and started for his own room.
