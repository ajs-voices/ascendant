# A Date?

Nox found his room in a pretty big disarray.  His bags were dumped on to his unmade bed.  All the cubboard doors and drawers were open, the closet doors flung as wide as possible.  The bathroom was a disaster, the towels left in the small linen closet were strewn all over the shower floor.

Nox sighed and set to cleaning up the bathroom.  The towels were white and fluffy, almsot hotel quality.  He picked them up and started folding them when a knock came on his door.  He'd left it open and the familiar voice of Dorian Vega came through, "Nox. You here?"

Nox shouted from the bathroom, "Yeah, come on in to the disaster area."

Dorian stopped in the open bathroom door and leaned against the frame and watched Nox.  "Seems my room was searched rather throughly."

Dorian laughed, "Mine wasn't nearly so bad.  But then again I'm certain that I was treated rather kindly due to the circumstances."

Nox looked up to see Dorian smiling despite the circumstances.  The smile quickly faded leaving behind lines that no one should have to have at any time.  Death was an not uncommong, but this was tradgic.

Nox put the freshly folded towels in the linen cloest and leaned his shoulder against the door with a smile.  "I'm sure they were darn right nice to you."  He grinned playfully then sighed, "I'm starving.  I need to go get something to eat.  If you don't mind coming with, we can talk on the way, during and all that."

Dorian smiled, "I think that will work.  I know a nice little place, if you don't mind."

Nox laughed, "Didn't you just come from a work dinner?"

Dorian nodded, "Yeah, but the wine is good and I can go for desert."

Nox smiled, "If that's what you want.  Let me grab another shirt.  I don't think other patrons will get a kick out of my t-shirt."

Dorian laughed, "I'm sure there are those who would readily agree with it."

Nox chuckled as he grabbed a navy blue button up shirt and pulled it over the t-shirt.  He rolled the sleeves up and button it most of the way up, leaving it untucked.  He hated wearing belts and that was just not the right look.   He turned to Dorian with a grin, "And are you one of them?"

Dorian smiled, "The night is still early."

Nox swallowed hard in reaction, he wasn't exactly sure what Dorian had just implied, and he was not willing to ask, not now.  Dorian was... He didn't know what Dorian was.  But he was finding himself drawn to the man.

Nox grabbed his wallet and his cell phone and tucked them in their appropriate pockets and motioned for Dorian to lead the way.  The other man walked out the door and waited for Nox to lock up before he started for the stairs.  "We can take the elevator you know."

Dorian laughed, "Habits, I suppose."

Nox grinned, "It's a habit for you to take the stairs?"

Dorian smiled, "With you, yes."  Dorian sighed, "I did not enjoy the fear it envoked in you.  It is nothing to take the stairs when I find I'm in your company."

Nox laughed, "You do realized that I broke the dread of heights when I was eight years old, at your suggestion if you recall."

Dorian nodded, "Yes, but by then I'd had it ingrained into me.  Those first years saw you in my office more times than I can count.  Dae'lin having had to adjust to you as much as you to her.  I expect the same of Levi and you."

Nox nodded, "Well if he's got as much potential as you think he does, then I'm sure we'll butt heads a few times.  How did your dinner go?"

Dorian stopped on the landing, they weren't even three quarters of the way to the ground floor yet.  He turned to look at Nox with a wry grin.  "I think that is something you should be sitting for."

Nox laughed, "I'm not going to fall down, no matter what you say.  I think I can walk.  You can't say that and not tell me now."  He winked at Dorian.

Dorian sighed but continued their descent of the stairs, "The lovely lady who Dae'lin has hired I think you might know."

"Seriously?"  Nox shook his head, "Stella was here in the building this morning?"

Dorian nodded, "Yes.  She was guaranteed the job."

Nox was confused, "Why?  She didn't seem to think so."

Dorian turned a slight shade of red, it was a cute look on the tanned skinned man.  "I told her mother it was an interview, but the job was hers no matter what if she came to interview for it."

The walked down an entire flight of stairs with their foot steps being the only sound until Dorian continued, "This whole progeny thing threw me for a loop.  To see if I could bring myself to do what was necessary I left my station for a few months to find someone I could try to with."

Nox grinned, "You mean you went to Denver to find a girl to sleep with?"

Dorian nodded, "Put bluntly, yes.  I found a girl I could .. with.  She was sweet and kind and young enough that my ... inexperience wouldn't be overly weird."

"Inexperience, Dorian I seriously doubt that.  With a girl maybe, but you are hardly inexperienced." 

Dorian chuckled, "And you know this, how?"

Nox could feel the blood rushing to his ears, "An educated guess."

They'd reached a level that they had to change stair cases in order to get to the front of the building, Dorian opened the door and put his hand on the small of Nox's back, guiding him slightly through the door before he stepped through afterwards.  Nox felt a shiver go up his spin and he had to swallow the sound that wanted to escape from just that singular touch.  Dorian smiled, "Well I suppose your guess is correct, she never complained or noticed to my knowledge."

Dorian continued his story, "I stayed for two months before I couldn't lie to her anymore.  She was getting serious and I couldn't love her."  Dorian sighed, "The day I told I was leaving, she'd had something to tell me.  She insisted I go first.  When I pressed her, she waved me off but her mother sent me an email bitching me out.  'How could you leave my daughter when she's pregnant with your child?'"

Nox closed his eyes, he couldn't imagine that feeling, knowing what he'd done to a nice girl.  He didn't have to ask how it happened, Dorian answered his unspoken question.  "She'd been sick, the condom broke, antibotic and that screwed us pretty good.  We thought things were okay.  But apparently not.    I'd told her mother I didn't love her daughter, but I would help however necessary, through her.  She agreed.  Stella lost her job about a week ago. When she told me Stella lost her job, I arranged for Dae'lin to hire her."

"Dae'lin's assistant's time was ending anyway, and with Stella, Dae'lin won't need to replace her for a while.  The meeting last night was informing Stella that her son was different."

Nox nodded, "And that you were different.  And she was about to become Venatori."

Dorian nodded, "Yes.  Her son is likely Magnus.  100% of minorem born to a human mother that both mother and child have surived have been Magnus."

"I know the statistic."

Dorian smiled, "I firgured you would.  You did quite a bit of research on your past if I recall."

Nox laughed, "Only on that, not curious enough to find out who my father was."

Dorian nodded, "Yes, there is that.  If I'd known you'd met Stella, I wouldn't have made the suggestion for yesterday."

Nox frowned, "Why not?  You expected me to sleep with her?"

Dorian laughed, "Actually yes.  I didn't expect the child to inhibit your natural inclination."

Nox smiled, "Seems I still have a few surprises left."

"You do at that."  Dorian lead then through the large double doors of the building and headed for the subway platform around the corner.  They didn't chat much while they caught the D train heading towards Little Italy.  Despite the hour it was relatively full car, it seemed everyone piled into this one car.  There was standing room only.  Which wasn't a bother really.

Dorian chose a spot near the rear of the car and used the strap to keep his balance.  Nox reached up just as the car lurched to a start and held on to the same one.  The motion of the car pressing Dorian's hip into the front of Nox.  They were close enough to whisper, Nox could feel Dorian's breath on his cheek before he spoke, "I didn't plan this honest."

Nox laughed, "I wouldn't have minded if you had."

They didn't talk the entire subway ride, they just looked at each other with a smile, pressed against each other until they reached their stop.  15 minutes later and they were walking out of the subway car grinning.  Nox slide his hand into Dorian's and entwined their fingers.  Once they got to the turn stiles they broke their grip on the other's hand and passed through to move to the streets above.

The air felt crisp and cool in the night air.  Dorian headed towards Mulberry street with his arm wrapped around Nox's waist.  It was not the night he'd been expecting, and he wasn't completely sure where it was going, but if Dorian wanted to touch him he was not going to complain.  He could feel the heat of the other man's arm around him through his shirt and was blown away at how different things were at this very moment.
