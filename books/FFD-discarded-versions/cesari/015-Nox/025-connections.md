# Connections

Nox was half way to his rooms when he passed the gym.  He hadn't known there was one on this level, but then again he hadn't been in the adult residences for more than a day and even then he hadn't had time to explore.  The door was propped open and it was relatively empty considering the early hour.  Nox stopped in front of the door pondering the idea of hitting a bag around a little while.  His neck ached from the awkward angle of sleeping on a couch, he was surprised his back wasn't killing him for the same reason.  His hand reflexively reaching behind to rub at the ache throbbing in his neck.

A voice from behind him made Nox jump, "Rough night?"

Nox frowned as he turned around to see his father standing two steps behind him.  He was carrying a bunch of files, a towel and a bottle of water, clearly intending to work and workout at the same time.  Nox had done it many a time and it seemed to run in the family.   "Sleeping on a couch does that."  He removed himself from the doorway stepping to back to allow Kai to pass, but the man remained where he was handing Nox the papers.  

"While you are here."  Kai walked into the gym and put his towel and water on the bench next to him as he started to warm up.  He continued once he got into rythym of his workout.  "Talk to me.  Tell me what those files are?  And why it's important to you."

Nox glanced down at the folders he smirked, they were the printouts of missions, some Dorian had given him, some from Dorian's mother, god rest her soul.  A twinge crept through Nox as he looked at the files, and the rest were from the Exuli files he'd set aside.  Kai had collected his research, no, he'd taken it from their locations.  Nox sat down on the bench and looked through them. 

"This is Dorian's work.  His beginnings of a theory formed from these files.  There are only two cases that fit the profile that I've come to think.  Mrs. Vega handed me those two cases after my laptop took a nose dive."  Nox set the two sets of files aside, he'd already looked through them pretty throughly.  "This last set here are Exuli."

Kai nodded, "And the Exuli fit how?"  He was up and moving now, shadow boxing off to the side of Nox's position.

"You and Emilio were in on two Exuli exiles in your early days.  They are the only cases that fit Dorian's profile.  But the sad thing is those two families aren't Magnus, no where even close.  So while they could be part of this, they aren't the ones setting the explosives, somoene else is."

"So these are all Exuli Magnus."  Nox held up the files so that Kai could see which files he meant.  "I've not gone through them, but they all need to be accounted for.  Someone needs to find them and question them."

Kai stopped punching the air and turned to look at him.  "Where are the families located, these Exuli Emilio and I exiled?"

Nox picked up the files and looked through them "Last known of Ms. Cox is Chicag  I o.  Reportedly with some human and had a daughter.  But she and her son in question haven't reported in in some time, almost 30 years it looks.  But that could just be were the print out stops."

Kai picked up the bottle of water next to Nox as Nox continued "These ones, they appear to have fled the country.  Last known is Africa, missonaries - go figure."

Kai laughed, "Spreading the word of God by the Venatori."  

Nox grinned, "Born again Christians or some such.  They checked in two months ago, still in Africa preeching about Jesus."  Nox pointed to the file, "That's exactly what it says."

"So our only connection is Chicago."  Kai spoke matter of factly.  "Any Exuli in those files in Chicago?"

Nox picked up the Exuli files and started thumbing through them, there were alot of files to go through.  Kai snatched the papers from him and set them down neatly.  "You came here for a reason.  Yes?"

Nox frowned, "I was kinda doing that before you rudely took the files away."

Kai smiled, "No.  Yes, you were doing your job.  I mean here.  The here and now, in the gym."

Nox grinned, "I was debating it.  Haven't done a good job staying on top of things since flying back in.  That and camping in the woods doesn't exactly leave for much time to pull out the pull ups without getting splinters anyway."

Kai gave Nox a friendly grin, "Show me what you got boy."

Nox laughed, "Yeah I learned along time ago not to go up against a full Venatori.  I prefer to keep the bruises I get to a minimum.  Not too good for picking up the ladies"

"Or the men, I imagine."  Kai said dryly.

"Ha!  Kai making a joke at my expense, how new."  Nox spouted before he could stop himself.  He was mildly surprised when Kai only cracked a smile.  Nox sighed, "Fine."  He didn't have anything on him but it wasn't like he'd not had a knock down drag out fight in jeans and a t-shirt before. 

Nox took off his shoes and socks, it was a freeing mentality, no shoes on was almost like setting the mind free.  He pulled off his shirt and heard Kai whistle.  "Damn boy!"  Nox looked up at his father with distrust and worry.  Kai nodded to his chest, and when Nox looked down he saw the wonderful black and blue bruise Aaron had left upon his chest the prior morning.

Nox grinned, "Like I said I like to keep my bruises to a minimum.  Doesn't work out so well when big black men decide that I'm not worthy to walk these halls."  

Kai frowned.  "You let them hit you?"

Nox smiled, "It's better that way.  When I beat the shit out of them later it was self defense.  Everyone can atest to it.  I didn't start it, but I finished it."  Oddly Kai smiled, it was a proud smile and Nox nearly fainted at the fact that his father was proud of him.

Kai muttered and Nox only barely heard it, "Don't let it go to your head boy."

And then the moment was over.  Kai threw a punch and Nox moved but not fast enough it caught him in the jaw and Kai sighed, "You really do suck at this."

Nox laughed, "I told you I learned a long time ago I can't win a fight against a Venatori without cheating."

"Cheating?  How so?"  Kai inquired.

"My ability is the only thing that got me through training."

"So you throw fireballs and walls of earth while sparing friends?"  Kai seemed truly interested.

"No, nothing quite so obvious.  Usually only air, doesn't work so well against air benders as they can see the patterns.  But most everyone else is oblivious when they punch a wall of air, or I sweep them over with a bar of air to the knee at just the right time.  When life isn't an issue I use what I can when I can in order to get the job done."

Kai nodded, "I will allow that.  But you singe a hair on my head and I'll have you dead for rights."

Nox laughed, "I'd really like to see you try Kai."

He shook his head, "Stop calling me that."

Nox frowned, "Would you prefer Mr. Videns then.  Because I sure as hell ain't calling you Dad or Father any other such endearmeant.  I could call you a few other choice words if you'd prefer."

Kai shook his head, "Is that the only other option?  You insult me or you talk to me with such formality that I look for my own father?"

Nox grinned, "And yet another thing we have in common.  But yes, that is the only other option."

Kai sighed, "Fine boy, Kai it is."

Nox laughed, "Do I dare ask you not to call me boy?  I've not been a boy for several years now."

Kai nodded, "Fair is fair.  Now if you don't mind, Nox," Kai said his name with empahsis, Nox was surprised he actually knew it well enough to say it, but he kept his smart comment to himself, "let's spar."

Nox nodded and they started circling one another.  Nox could have had Kai flat on his back already, but he wasn't here to cheat, not really, he hadn't come here for more than just a simple workout against one of the bags to vent some pent up fustration.  It was almost better than a cold shower.  Nox grinned at that.

Kai frowned as he throw a punch at Nox's head which Nox reflexivly sidestepped but Kai's fist laned against a cushion of air before smashing into Nox's chin again.  Kai sighed, "That will take getting used to.  Wipe the grin off your face."

Nox laughed, "Why ever for would I do that?"

Kai's body moved at superhuman speed, throwing punches and kicks all aimed at Nox's upper body.  The man was so intent on hurting Nox for his smart mouth, he hadn't see Nox drop to the ground sweeping the legs out from the other man.  Nox stood up with a smirk on his face and offered his father a hand.  He wanted to make a quip but he didn't he just grinned at his father who dusted off and stood up.  He hadn't actually gotten dirty, it was a reflexive action everyone did.  Straightening out your clothes to be presentable when you were embarrassed.  Nox tried not to grin, but he failed and Kai's flew at him again.

Nox could barely manage to keep the flurry of body parts from his own, he managed to block the majority of them but a few shots knocked the wind from his lungs.  Nox pushed both hand forward the patterns of air knocking Kai backwards.  Nox gasped for breath once the flurry of attackes stopped as Kai lay on his back again.  Nox panted as he knelt down and offered his father a hand again while he caught his breath.  Kai asked, "Air benders see you coming a mile away don't they?"

Nox grinned and nodded still catching his breath.  Kai shook his head.  "I didn't know what happened when the air flew from my lungs until I was carening backwards like I was on the edge of the roof."

Nox grinned, "Sorry.  Defense is by far my better talent."

Kai nodded appreciatevely, "Don't apologize for your skills.  You had plenty of time to perfect your ability."  Kai picked up his water bottle and towel and tossed Nox his shirt.  "One day, I'd like to watch you work all the elements like that."

Nox nodded, "I'm sure you'll have ample oppurtunity once we catch this guy."

Kai smiled, "Let me know what you find in the files.  I'll leave it to you since you have a handle on the theory.  I will be questioning our inside man suspects again today."  And with that his father walked out of the gym, leaving Nox with a pile of work and the need for a shower, still.  And a new found respect for his father.
