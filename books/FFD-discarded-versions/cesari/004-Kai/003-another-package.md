# Another Package

Kai went to his rooms in the residences to catch a little r'n'r.  Compared to his son's room they were well lived in and had far more personality.  But compared to the Vega's he was downright poor.  The walls had been painted a nice light blue color, just a hint of blue really, nothing so pomp as sky blue or even navy, just a hint of color.  Some said they were gray, but Kai knew better though he didn't correct them.

The floor was lamanante wood flooring in a amber wood stain.  It wasn't nearly so polished as the Vega's had been.  But it was swept and clean.  There were a few pictures on the wall, things that Kai thought were interesting, mostly historical prints of New York City, though one wall was dedicated to his family.  His once live in girlfriend had created the wall, the black picture frames of snapshots of Kai and the children growing up and their graduation and baby pictures.  Sadly the girl didn't work out, and she'd left him for some guy who'd take care of her better.  Kai was find with that.  It was better when he was alone, less squabbles.

Sitting on the kitchen counter there was a box.  Boxes these days were dangerous.  It was addressed to Kai Viddens the address looked legit, it was neatly stamped from the mailroom.  Kai stared at it for a moment but he couldn't see anything strange.  But he wasn't a fool.  

He could call the fire squad and have them look at it, or he could call Dae'lin and Dorian, and even Emilio to come take a gander at was probably an innocous package that he'd ordered and forgotten about.  It wasn't the first time that it had happened.

Kai sighed and did the paranoid thing.  He got a hold of Emilio and told him to bring Dorian, at least he could see any patterns, or that's what he said anyway.  Kai was still having a hard time beleiving that if you can see the patterns you can manipulate them.  But that particular line of thinking was working its way into the mainstream thinking thanks to the younger generations - namely because of his very own son.  Not that the boy had any notition of the following with is abrupt departure from the City after his Ad Aetatem.  

Kai knew if he called Dae'lin she'd bring in the boy, and Kai wasn't exactly ready to face Nox.  So he decided not to call her.

About five minutes after he'd gotten a hold of Emilio he and Dorian were at his door knocking.  Kai sighed when he opened the door.  "Dae'lin."  Kai gestured for them to enter waving Dorian to the package on the counter.

"How'd it get there?" Emilio queried.

"No idea.  I assume the cleaning crew found it in front of my door.  Nothing else looked out of place."  Kai hadn't noticed anything anyway, but he was rarely in his rooms so it was likely that something else could have been missing but nothing too important anyway, his gear was still neatly stowed in the closet and the gun safe was still shut and locked behind a rather large print of the Empire State building.

Dorian nodded to himself, "Same patterns as with the one my father had been sent.  Nox should look at this.  It should be safe to move someplace else."

Kai smiled at the youngest Vega, he had anticipated his reaction and provided a solution before there ever was a problem presented.  Kai had a curious question pop into his head, "Did you disarm the other one?"

Dorian looked to Kai and frowned, "No.  The firesquad tried in the confines of a safe space, it blew up.  No one was hurt."

Kai nodded, he'd expected as much other wise the boy would have seen the last package.  "Do you honestly think he can do anything with it?"

Dorian quirked the corner of his mouth in a semi-smile but it didn't last long, he'd found something humorous but like his father showed very little emotion when in front of others, even though he'd seen the man laugh plenty of times in much more intimate family settings.  "I imagine he'll find it interesting and unravel it before anyone can stop him."

If he was going to jump off the deep end he might as well ask everything, "Why do you think that?"

"Your son has a fondness for puzzles.  He'll want to figure out how it was done.  And while the pattern is complex to me.  I suspect there is a greater pattern at work that simplifies everything."

Kai sighed, "A complex pattern to simiply complexity?"

Dorian laughed, "Well when you put it that way it sounds foolish.  What I mean to say is that I see a pattern as the whole, most patterns, can be broken down into smaller patterns.  It's what a programmer does, they solve the bigger problem, by breaking in down into smaller programs until the individual peice does something very specific but it makes the whole outer peices work."

Kai looked at Dorian with confusion, Dorian continued as if he'd known that Kai was having trouble understanding him, "It's like the boxes of Nox's mastery test.  Each individual peice worked fine for everyone, solve the problem and move on to the next peice.  Nox put the peices together and started a chain reaction.  He essentially took the already pre-programmed peices and fit them together in a way that solved the problem.  I suspect he'll do the same here only in reverse, and he'll do it not because he wants to learn how to do it, but because he's drawn to puzzles he's never seen before."

Kai shook his head, "As long as you take it elsewhere, he can do whatever he likes."  Kai was interested in watching but he couldn't bring himself to actually be in the same room as his son.  He didn't need to deal with that particular aspect of his life at this very moment.  He had enough to deal with, with a son in the infirmary and a mad person out to hurt his and his best friends family.

Dae'lin hadn't said d a word till that moment.  "Nox isn't answering his phone."

Dorian smirked, "He's out, studying some papers I gave him.  He probably forgot his phone."

Dae'lin laughed, "I seriously doubt it.  You are lying to me!  Why?"

"Leave the boy be for a few more hours.  He just got home and you are running him through the ringer."  Dorian was watching out for his son - something the man had been doing the boy's whole life.  Kai might have to take a moment and sit down with the youngest Vega to get a better understanding of the son he hadn't known he'd had until a few years ago.

Kai nodded, "He can look at it when he gets back."

Dae'lin sshook her head, "No he's here to do his job."  Dae'lin started typing furiously on her phone.  She walked out of Kai's apartment with her head lowered and mumbling to herself.  She was angry at Nox and angry at Dorian from the sounds Kai could decipher as she left.

Dorian carefully picked up the box, "I'll let you know what he finds.  If you don't wish to be there.  I suspect he'll be on his way back shortly the way Dae'lin won't relent."

Kai nodded, "Take it to a room with a two-way.  I'm not sure..."

Dorian held up a hand to stop Kai, "No words necessary.  I will take it to the testing room.  He'll not know you are there.  You'll likely want to arrive before or after he does."

The two Vega's left Kai alone in his now rather empty rooms.  He sighed.  So much for relaxing for a moment.  Back to work it was.
