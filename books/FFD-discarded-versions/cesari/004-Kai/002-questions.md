# Questions

Kai found that when he went to the Infirmary Gloria was already in Nicholas' room.  She hadn't even bothered to tell him that their son was out of surgury.  He rolled his eyes at the woman.  Nicholas was lying in bed, his eyes were hooded and he had bandages on his face and arms.  The least of the burns were already healing, Kai hoped that meant the others would too.

Nicholas smiled as he looked past his mother and saw him standing in the doorway, it looked painful.  He nodded his head in hello and Kai smiled back, "Hey."

Gloria looked up and frowned, "Be gone!  This is your fault."

Kai looked shocked at her, "Mine?"

"The rumors, Kai.  The rumors fly around this place faster than a wildfire.  You and your friend, Emilio Vega.  You're the reason our son is hurt."

Kai sighed, he really hated the rumor mill.  He'd hated it as a kid and he hated it even worse as an adult.  Adults gossiped far more and harder than any teenager every could.  But then again when everyone in your world knows everyone else in your world, it becomes common knowledge sooner rather than later.  Living on compound had it's advantages, but there were certain disadvantages Kai could live without.

Kai sat down on the edge of his son's bed and patted his knee, Nicholas winched in pain, "Sorry."  Kai quickly removed his hand from the injured knee.  "What did they tell you?"

Gloria answered instead of Nichoals.  "The doctor's say he'll recover, but as with an injury he'll need to work to regain strength and agility he once had.  The muscles and skin will need to remember."

Kai nodded, "Your mother will be leaving now.  Say your good-byes."  He turned to Gloria, "I need to speak to my son alone."

Gloria glared at him but she got up and walked to the door, "I'll be back with supper in a few hours."

Nicholas nodded in agreement.  She would likely bring his his favorite in an attempt to gain whatever favor she intende to curry with the boy.  At least she remembered who paid the bills.

"Can you talk, Nick?"

Nick nodded, "Yes sir.  It only hurts a little."

Kai nodded, "Well I won't ask too much now.  Can you tell me what happened?"

Nick frowned, "I opened a package.  It was mine, addressed to me.  It looked like anything else I've ordered online.  Brown box, came from the mail room except it was deleivered wrong the first time.  Some kid gave it to me.  I opened it and then world went fuzzy.  I saw light and could feel things burning."

"Do you remember anything else?  Did you know the kid?"

Nick shook his head, "No Sir, the kid was new, still in highschool I think, he was wearing a sox hat and his hair was dark, beyond that I'm sorry I didn't pay attention."

Kai chuckled, "You not pay attention to a boy?"

Nick smiled and winced in pain, "I know right?  I was more interested in what I'd gotten in the mail.  Sorry, I didn't know it was going to blow up in my face."  It hurt to laugh from the looks of it but it hadn't stopped his son.  At least he was in good humor.

"One last thing.  Did you have paper on your table, something you'd written about your family?"

Nick shook his head, "No sir.  I haven't hand written anything since school.  Maybe there was a note with the box?"

Kia nodded, "I was afraid of that."  Kia stood up.  "I will let you rest."  He leaned over and hugged his son.  It had been a long time since they'd done that.  Nick even returned the hug, "I'll check in on you before the day is over.  Don't let your mother badger you or guilt you."

Nick nodded knowingly as Kai left his son's room.  It was hard to beleive he and Nox had gone to school together without ever knowing it.  That small fact was one of the reasons the boy rubbed him the wrong way.  Both of his youngest sons, three months apart, both of them liked the same sex and they'd been caught making out in the hall once in highschool.  

Kai had blamed the other boy, who know he knows was his son the whole time, for making his son the way he was.  He had refused to listen to Dae'lin or Nicholas about that fact.  But now it was compounded by the fact that it was his half brother.  Kai stalked out of the infirmary with raw memories floating to the surface.
