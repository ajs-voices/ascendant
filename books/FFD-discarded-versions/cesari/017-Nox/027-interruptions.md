# Interruptions

Nox followed Dae'lin out the door and watched her leave, she turned back and laughed when she saw him watching her.  "You aren't suppose to be checking me out Nox.  I'm almost a married woman."

Nox grinned, "Keep thinking that."

She rounded the corner and Nox shut the door.  His phone rang and Nox sighed as he answered it, "Yes?"

There was a chuckle on the other side of the phone that nearly made his heart melt.  "You don't sound enthusastic."

Nox laughed, "I was having a good day until Dae'lin stopped in."

"I'm sorry.  Did it all work out?"  Dorian asked concern heavy in his voice.

"All is well.  She just brought up a few bad things."

"You alright?" 

Nox smiled, "Yeah Dorian I'm good.  I'll tell you over dinner tonight."

Dorian laughed, "Is that your way of asking me out to dinner?"

"It's no better than how you asked me.  You kinda just tagged along while I went to eat."  

"Toche."  Nox could hear Dorian smile.

"I can do better than that.  Dorian, I'd like to cook for you tonight.  Do you care to join me?"  Nox was fidgetting as he paced back and forth, he wasn't exactly sure why he was nervous.  

"Well I suppose, I can make the time to watch you dance around my kitchen some more?"

Nox laughed, "Your kitchen?  Who said I was cooking in your apartment."

Dorian sounded hurt, "I assumed.  But if you want to cook in your beige room in all it's boring atmosphere I suppose I can join you."  The playful note rising as he went on.

Nox smiled, "You know I tease.  I'd love to have you watch me dance around your kitchen."

Dorian chuckled.  "Would you like me to pick anything up?"

"Steak, and salad fixings you like?"

"No surprising me?"

Nox laughed, "What fun would that be?  I can pick it all up as long as you pick the wine?"

"I'll do the wine, I'll eat whatever you make Nox.  I don't think I've ever had anyone want to cook for me."  Dorian confided.

Nox grinned, "Good.  I'll see you tonight, 7 sound good?"

"Sure thing.  I'll see you later.  But a date wasn't what I was calling about."  He chuckled to himself, "Your father?  You saw him this morning?"

Nox laughed, "You hear everything don't you?" 

Dorian chuckled, "He stopped in my office to congradulate me on a job well done.  He mentioned your theory on the Exuli, claimed it was all my idea.  I nodded and shook his hand and had no clue what he was on about.  You can enlighten me at dinner about that encounter as well.  He never once called you boy either."

"He said he wouldn't, I'm impressed.  It was a good morning."  Nox grinned, "A very good morning everything including waking up on the couch in your living room."   

"Happy to oblige.  I look forward to seeing you later."  Dorian hung up the phone and Nox's heart was fluttering with excitement.  He was surprised at the reaction so quickly.  Nox walked into the bathroom and started the shower just as a knock sounded at his door.  "Oiy."

Nox turned off the water and walked to the front door again and he 
saw Levi standing outside with a smile.  "Can I show you something?"

Nox stepped aside with his arm stretched in front of him, "Be my guest."

Levi took a look around, "This is a boring room, so not what I expected."

Nox laughed, "It's temporary."

Levi nodded and sat down on the edge of Nox's bed and put his hands in front of him.  "I've been practicing, I know I'm not supposed to but ..."

In one hand Levi held a small smooth stone.  Levi morphed the patterns in his other hand and the rock duplicated perfectly.  Nox grin madly as Levi looked up at him with pride in his eyes.  "Well done, Levi."

Nox created a simple singluar flame in his hand, "And this?"

Levi held his hand out and replicated the dancing flame without flaw.  He struggled a little but he saw the patterns.  "You see the patterns?"

Levi nodded, "I always have.  I just didn't understand.  I thought I was seeing things.  But when I listened to those kids describe what they saw you do I was like, I saw that.  I see you differently.  You move differently.  Different than Mr. Hill or Dorian or my other instructors."

Nox grinned, "That's Cesari pattern, you do the same thing.  I'm proud of you."

Levi nodded, "I have a class to get to.  Can we talk later?"

"Sure, anytime before 7.  I have plans then."

Levi nodded, "Alright."  And just as he had arrived Levi was gone out his bedroom door.  Nox's mood was elevated again.  He glanced at the shower and shrugged.  He changed his shirt and picked up the files and headed to the Archives to do his research that Kai approved of.
