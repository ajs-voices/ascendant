# Negotiations

The workout had been good for the soul, it always was, he would likely have a few more bruises to show off later.  At least they'd be gone soon, and it was well worth it, his father was on his back more times than he was.  That in and of it self made Nox smile.  Nox reached inside his jean pocket for his key as another voice interrupted him, "You seem awefully happy."

Nox turned around and grinned at Dae'lin and her sweet little voice as she rounded the corner.  "Been a good morning, for a change."

Dae'lin laughed, "As opposed to..."  She left the question hanging and Nox rolled his eyes and turned back to unlock his door.

"As opposed to yesterday where I didn't get to eat breakfast and the fight I was in I used my ability to hurt someone.  Something I don't enjoy doing."  

"And today was different how?"  Dae'lin asked intriqued as she walked into Nox's room and closed the door behind her.

Nox put the files on the table and leaned against it, "I ate a full breakfast in good company, and the fight I got in was consentual.  Now I need a shower."

Dae'lin laughed, "Who did you spar with this morning?"

Nox grinned, "My father, of all people."

Dae'lin gave him a flat look, "I see."

Nox laughed, "It's all good.  He was decent about everything for a change.  Even called me by my name."

"No boy?  Impressive.  You have time to talk?  You've been so busy we've not had time to sit down and talk."  Dae'lin was persitant in her goals that much he could say about her.

Nox sighed with a glance at the shower and pulled a chair out for Dae'lin and took the other seat across from her chair.  "I suppose, if we have to."

Dae'lin sat down, she crossed her legs in front of her and leaned back in the chair, she was sporting a little blue dress that was barely any covering for her legs.  Nox shook his head when he noticed that she'd dressed in a very specific way, attracting his attention to various parts of her body.  Her hands were folder in her lap but her body language was far from casual, she was trying her best to seem laid back but she was failing miserably.

Nox laughed.  "You try too hard."

Dae'lin leaned forward in a fit of rage, "I do what?"

Nox grinned as he got up from his chair and grabbed two bottles of water.  "You try too hard."  He turned to look at her before he grabbed a glass from the cupboard.  "I'll notice you without dressing that way."  He walked over to the fridge and he could hear her sputtering for words embarrassed likely, her tanned skin probably as red as ever.  Nox grabbed a few handfuls of ice and dropped into the glass.  He smiled at her as he placed the glass of ice on the table with a bottle of water.  "You don't need to impress me Dae'lin."  She blushed again this time he watched the color rise in her cheeks and up her neck.  He cracked his bottle of water and took a sip before he continued, "I'm not oblivous to your charms despite my feelings about this whole thing."

Dae'lin sighed, "You...", she couldn't finish her sentence, and Nox could only guess at what she had thought to say.

Nox laughed, "I'm what, attracted to men?  I have certain tastes?  You think you need to attract my attention to win?  As if there would be anyone else in the running Dae'lin.  He leaned forward in the chair.  There is no way they are going to let me sleep with some random woman anymore.  If they had their way I'd be stuck in a room and breed like a fucking race horse in a stable.  They want what I have Dae'lin.  That's what this is all about."

Dae'lin sighed, "It doesn't have to be like that though.  There can be more."

Nox laughed, "You don't want more.  You want to do your duty, give the Venatori another Cesari like me, and you are the closest possible match to make that happen and override my limitations.  There is no other choice in the matter.  Genetics over love, aren't I right?"

Dae'lin looked down, he'd nailed it on the head and she was embarrassed.  when she looked up she was even redder but she asked her question, "Is that why you choose to be with men?  To sleep with who you want?  To fuel your limitations?"

"No, Dae'lin.  I sleep with men because I honest to god am attracted to them.  I enjoy it, sometimes more than a woman.  Granted I am not shy about it for that reason."

Dae'lin laughed, "I knew it.  I knew you were prolific in your flaunting that one predisposition to rebel against everyone.  One thing no one could push from you.  But why not forgo all women too?"

Nox laughed, "Duckling, I love women too."

Dae'lin sighed, "But..."

"But what Dae'lin?"

The woman blushed yet again she was going to remain beat red if she didn't stop it, "I saw you leave Dorian's room this morning."

"Did you now?  Who did you tell?"

She looked at him with confusion.  "No one.  Why?"

Nox shook his head, "No reason.  Dorian didn't want to be alone.  We went to dinner, talked patterns, jumped together then watched a movie where I proceeded to fall asleep on his couch.  I made him breakfast and then I left."

"Rumors run around here like wildfire.  They said you looked cozy with him."

Nox smiled, "And what business is it of your's who I get cozy with?  You want my genetics, I am not going to get Dorian pregnant unless there is something I truly do not know about sex."

Dae'lin paled.  "You don't even deny it?"

"Deny what?  That I like Dorian.  What point would there be in that Dae'lin?  I like men.  I like Dorian.  It'll get around even if I deny it."

"But..."  

Nox reached across the table and put his hand on hers. "No but Dae'lin.  He has no bearing on this.  On what you want.  So speak to me what are the terms?  What does the bloodline commity submit to me as fair trade?"

She sighed, "My line, then your's provided they pass as Venatori, with your limitations being the only acceptable outcome."

"And if the children fail to have enhance senses and healing at minimum?"

Dae'lin sighed, "Death."

Nox shook his head, "No fucking way."

"They do not want to weaken the lines any farther Nox."  She pleaded with them.  "I don't think they will negotiate that."

"Fine on the weakening the lines, I understand that, but there is no fucking way I'm going to agree to have my child killed because he doesn't meet some stupid rule.  Steralize him, remove him from the breeding programs, but death, if that is the only way they can go to fucking hell Dae'lin.  I will not do it.  I can't beleive you would let them do that to your child."

"It is my duty."

"Fuck duty."  Nox stood up his chair falling backwards in the rush to move in his anger.  He started pacing back and forth in fury, he could feel the fire churing around him.

Dae'lin stood up Nox barely comprehended the scraping of the chair along the floor as she walked over to him and put her hand on his arm, "Calm down."

Nox looked at Dae'lin with anger, "Calm down?  I'm not you.  I'm not going to start a damn fire because I'm pissed off.  That shit was beat out of me as a child.  You may think it was all flowers and candy in my training.  But it wasn't."

Dae'lin looked at him like he was lying.  "No one abused you as a child, Nox."

Nox yanked his arm free of her grip, "The fuck they didn't."

"Someone would have told me if other kids were getting abused."

Nox smirked, "Who said they told anyone.  I sure as hell didn't.  But I made sure he wouldn't do it again when I got control of my abilities.  Got another fucking year of fire starter training for that 'accident'".  Nox put air quotes around the world accident.

Dae'lin sound incredulous, "Nox!"

"What?  He fucking beat me every day for a year. I was half human female born minorem, no one would care about me if I died.  He beat me because I sparked when I was afraid.  The first time he was understanding, the remainder of them he beat me to make me stop sparking.  You know the only good thing about my abilities, the healing allowed him to beat me and hide the fact that he had been."

"So you what, lit him on fire.  I remember your last accident.  Your instructor..."  Dae'lin didn't finish the sentence as she covered her mouth in realization.  She reached out and touched Nox's hand, "I didn't know."

Nox pulled away from Dae'lin and flopped down on his bed, "No one knew, Dae'lin and I'd appreciate it stay that way."

Dae'lin sat on the edge of the bed, Nox stared up at the ceiling, "If we have a fire-starter they won't go through that Dae'lin. I'll train the kid myself."

Dae'lin put her hand on his knee, "I understand.  I will speak to them about unqualified children.  They will relent."

Nox nodded, "What else do we have to go over?"

"We can talk about this later, Nox."

Nox sat up and leaned on his elbows, "No, let's finish this shit so I can go about my day without worring about rehashing this conversation."

Dae'lin sighed, "I don't want to be a mother."

Nox sat up fully, "You what?"  Nox raised an eyebrow.  "You expect me to do this?"

Dae'lin got up and started pacing, "The Venatori can raise my children, I don't want my mother's life."

Nox sighed, "No, Dae'lin they won't.  Your bloodline should be raised by you.  But if you refuse then I will."

Dae'lin sighed turned on her heel and stared at him like he was an alien, "You'd give up hunting to raise a child?  You would stay here?"

Nox shook his head, "I would stay here even if you wanted to raise the child yourself.  I will not be my father, and I will not be my mother."  He nearly spat at the thought of leaving a child to the will of the Venatori.

Dae'lin started walking for the door.  "Nox.  How is it that we see things so differently.  I thought...."  She opened the door and Nox stopped it's progress before she even got it a crack.  He pressed it closed with air, she stared at him with heat rising in her eyes.  "Let me go, Nox."

Nox stood up and walked over to her and put his hand against the door and leaned into it, close enough to whisper in her ear, he could smell the rose petals in her perfume.  "You thought you'd raised me differently.  You thought because I had no parents, that I'd be okay with letting my children live the life I had."

Dae'lin looked up at him with pleading eyes.  Nox shook his head his voice went quiet and distant, "I will raise our children without the help of the so-called Venatori community.  I will be both father and mother if I have to be.  I will give you your blood line.  I will insure the survivablity of he Venatori race.  I will accept that my children may never have children.  But if they think for one minute that I will let my children die, or be raised by the Venatori without my guidance I will become Exuli.  I will remove my gift from the bloodline of the Venatori all together.  They will accept or they will not have my genes for thier use."

Dae'lin let out a gasp, there was sadness in her eyes and fear too.  She nodded and reached for the door knob.  "I will relay the message.  I expect they will accept, you are too important."

Nox removed his hand from the door and let the patterns go.  Dae'lin reached up and touched Nox's cheek.  There was pity in her eyes, and sadness trailed across the lines on her face.  "For whatever it's worth, I'm sorry."

Nox shook his head, "Forget it.  Take them my terms and we can finish this non-sense until you are ready for the second child."

Dae'lin nodded, "Of course.  Nox..."

He grinned at her, "I'm fine.  I promise."  He leaned in and kissed her softly on the lips, "You look delectable.  Next time don't try so hard."

Dae'lin blushed again, "What would you prefer I wear?"  

Nox grinned, "You are perfectly acceptable the way you normally dress.  I'm pretty sure even after a workout you are perfectly acceptable."  He gave her a smile that suggested what he was implying, "And there would be less to take off then."

"NOX!"  Dae'lin nearly screamed his name at him for being so lewd.  He grined at her and she giggled. "You are the worst ever.  Not sure how you talk girls into your bed so easily."

He grinned as leaned in to her ear, "I didn't have to talk too hard to get you in my bed."  That earned Nox a punch in the arm but he laughed.  "Well I didn't."

Dae'lin sighed and kissed Nox on the cheek, "You are right I suppose."  She grinned up at him, "How hard did you talk to get Dorian in your bed?"

Nox laughed with a wink, "I don't kiss and tell."

She giggled, "So you kissed him."  She laughed, "Should I be jealous?"

Nox grinned, "Yes."

Dae'lin pouted with gusto, it was cute to see that bottom lip sticking out.  He leaned in and kissed it sucking on her bottom lip before biting it gently.  "What do you want out of this Dae'lin?"  

She looked up at him.  "Nox.  I don't want a relationship either." 

Nox laughed, "I know that.  You are with some minorem who was steralized.  That's why you don't want to raise children."

Dae'lin looked surprised, "How did you know that?"

Nox grinned, "You upped my clearance.  I saw your petition for marriage.  Jerry should consider himself lucky.  You do your duty and you can get married?"

Daa'lin nodded, "If I can get you to agree yes."

Nox smiled, "My terms you have.  I need nothing in return Dae'lin.  Just to live my life.  You can be with Jerry, I'll raise our kids, you can be mom or aunt Dae'lin, whatever you want.  I'll be fine.  I promise."

"Are you sure Nox?"  Dae'lin wrapped her ams around him, "Thank you."

Nox grinned, "I'm good I promise."

"You'll stay here and do what?"  

"Teach of course.  Didn't you tell me I should do that, my views, my ability?"  Nox grinned.  Dae'lin hugged him tightly and then opened the door.

"I will get the commities answer as soon as possible."  Dae'lin smiled, "I will see you later, love."
