# The Place Between Worlds

I put my hand free hand on his other arm and I stepped into the shadow of the trees and walked out between the worlds.  It was no place special really but it was the only place in the entire town that was in the shadows no matter what time of day.  It was protected by human and vampire magic.  If a vampire stepped into the circle from the shadows and continued to walk they would be burnt alive.  And there was no stopping it.  Tony began to walk and I grabbed his arms.  "No."  He stopped but looked at me for an explanation.  "If you step more outside the circle you'll perish."

Tony looked down.  "I don't see a circle."

I smiled, "Of course not, it would be a dead giveaway.  Just wait here.  Someone will come once they are sure we mean them no harm."  The call of birds unknown carried through the town, first close and then farther away.  It was a signal, one that was rarely every issued.  "They will come."

Tony looked down at my arm and held it up at an awkward angle.  I pulled it away from him and wrapped both arms around his waist.  "I'm fine.  Just stand still."  I put my head on his chest, it felt natural and Tony wrapped his arms around me and put his cheek against the top of my head.  We held each other and waited.  I couldn't go anywhere even if I had wanted to.  The sun was everywhere and there was little shadow even in this place between worlds.  

In one direction lay the room I had been kept in.  The sun was beaming down into the room bathing the coffin in radiant light.  To the other direction lay town, there was about five feet of shadow here that was protected with the magic, but moving too far from your entry point was your demise.  We waited for an uncountable amount of time before Thea came running.  "I'm so sorry."  She apologized profusely.  She reached the edge of the shadow and waved her hand and muttered a few verses in a language I had not heard in many years.  

"I'm afraid you are stuck there until sundown.  We have nothing to offer of sufficient protection."  I nodded and tried to sit down against the wall behind us.  Tony grabbed my arm before I could.  Thea laughed, "You can move.  She can't leave the shadows for the sun."

Tony relaxed slightly and let go of my arm.  I sat down with my back against the wall.  I looked up at Tony, "You can move now."  He turned to look down at me and smiled.  It was an alluring smile and I knew exactly what he was thinking.  What man wouldn't?  He turned around and sat down next to me.  

"I guess I can keep you company."  Tony put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me next to him.  I laid my head on his shoulder.

Thea looked down at me.  "Can you protect the shadows until you can find shade?"

I nodded then frowned, "I'd do better with my weapons."

Thea nodded and walked back towards the cabins in the woods.  It really was a nice place - quiet and peaceful.  Moments later Ryan walked out of the hut Thea had gone into.  He carried a bundle in his arms towards us.  He smiled at me and shook Tony's hand.  "Good to have you back in one piece."

Tony laughed, "Afraid some beastie got me?"

Ryan handed me the bundle in his arms.  "No, not really.  Not unless you consider our friend here a beastie."

Tony smiled as Ryan sat down in front of us, "She tried to kill me, but her sword was not there."

Ryan sighed, "Probably for the best with her current mood and all."  He kicked at my foot playfully.

I looked down at my bare feet.  It had been a very interesting day and I was still wearing the same close I had when I'd gone to sleep twelve years ago.  "It's been twelve years?"  I asked making sure I'd heard them right before.

Ryan nodded.  

"It took two years to find you," I glanced at Tony, "It's that bad?"

Tony nodded and looked away.  Ryan sighed, "Give him time."

"Whatever.  I didn't do anything."

Tony glared at me, "That's the point.  You didn't DO anything."

I stood up and Tony did the same, we stood toe to toe.  My anger rose, Tony's anger filled me.  "It's not my fault you killed your family."

Tony pushed me and I could feel the sun's rays on my exposed skin.  The pain only fueled the anger as I threw a fist at Tony's face.  He caught it effortlessly, I brought my left around to jab him in the gut and he caught it too.  I tried to pull away from him but he held me close.  "Calm down, Cari.  Calm down."

I didn't want to calm down.  I wanted to hurt him.  I was tired of being blamed for things.  

Ryan pushed me and Tony pulled me back deeper into the shadows.  He spoke calmly, "Cari, you need to get out of the sun."

I hadn't realized I was burning, but the moment I stepped into the shadows my skin started to heal.  I pulled my hands from Tony and fell back into Ryan.  

Tony glared at me then calmly spoke, "I'm going to go home."  He stepped into the shadows and was gone.

I slide down Ryan's body and crawled to the wall in the deepest part of the shadows and curled up in the fetal position.  Ryan started to say something, but I interrupted him, "Just go.  Leave me alone."  As an afterthought I added, "please."

I put my forehead against my knees and felt Ryan walk away.  I was alone but I still wasn't happy.  I sat in the shadows as the world passed me by.  I saw a shadow join me, but I didn't look up.  

I was surprised to hear Tristan, "You need to sleep."

I looked up and only saw his silhouette.  "I can't.  I see it when I close my eyes.  And I feel Tony's rage and my heart breaks."

Tristan grabbed my hands and pulled me to my feet.  He turned me around and wrapped his arms around me before he put his back against the wall he was standing nearest too and slide down with me still in his arms.  I let him.  He was radiating calm and I really didn't want to fight it.  I put my head against his chest.  

"Close your eyes and sleep.  I'll keep you safe from your dreams.  I can give you that at least.  I can't do anything about Tony.  But I will tell you that he loves you, he never stopped.  Just give him time."  Tristan started singing softly and I closed my eyes.  It didn't take long before I was in total silence in the place between worlds.
