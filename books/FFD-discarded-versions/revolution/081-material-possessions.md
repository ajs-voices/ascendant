#Material Possessions

Day came and Davyn found us still working on our little projects.

He looked horrible.  Skylar glared at him.  Aurora took her away, they had done enough, "Come honey, let's catch some Zs."  Aurora glared at Davyn as well but she turned and ushered Skylar out.  Ant stood just behind me with his father.  It felt extremely awkward to have them just an inch behind me as if I was the that needed protecting.  But they weren't protecting me, they were ready to fight if it came to it.

Davyn raises his hands to signal he meant no threat to any of us.  He didn't smile, but there was a little joy in his eyes, "I come with good tidings."  Davyn handed me a rather large nugget of some metal I had never seen before in my life.  But after closer inspection I realized exactly what it was.  "You still mean to help us?"

Davyn frowned, "I made you a promise, have you taken your promise back?"

I shook my head, "No I will protect those of New Haven with my life if necessary."

He smiled, "Then yes, I still mean to help.  Though the rest of our bargains are off."

I shrugged, "Fine with me.  How much of this do you have?"

"There is a limited supply but if you can mine it you can have it.  It's just useless metal to us.  But while you worked with Skylar," he frowned, "I had some of my people mine up a few buckets full."

I blinked in surprise.  "Buckets?"

He nodded with a smile, "Did you get your forge done?"

Ant laughed, "Of course we did."  Ant elbowed his father, "We've been waiting for this joker here to make up his mind."

Tony elbowed his son back and they had a fun shoving match behind me.  How becoming.  Davyn sniggered at them.

Two of Davyn's vampires walked into the room and put four buckets of this precious metal at my feet.  We could do a lot with that.  I looked at them, "They will be crude in the time we have but they will work."

Ant was already off carrying two buckets.  He was headed to the forge and to the book that we would need to finalize the pieces.  I offered Davyn my hand, "Still friends."

He surveyed me before taking my hand, "Friends."

Tony picked up the remaining buckets and we left Davyn's company and made our way to the forge they had built only weeks before.
