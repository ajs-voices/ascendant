# Redemption

I was just so tired of getting the blame.  It wasn't my fault Brandon and Valence wanted to take over the world.  But apparently my life and my actions are what people judge the world by.  Just because Valence was too dangerous to live, I was deemed unworthy of life.  Yes I killed a village when I was given my freedom.  I had not killed a single human soul since that day, except for Johnny, but I embraced him.  I had faked human deaths before when working for the mob, but I did not kill them.  I sent them off to a new life.  They were grateful to me.  But I was sentenced to death because of another's actions.  I hated the council for that.  

I walked until there was no anger left in my heart.  I don't know how long it was, or how far I'd walked.  I'd just walked away.  I turned around and saw nothing but empty plains behind me.  The sun was below the horizon, there were no shadows.   I took a deep breath and I turned around.  I thought about the lives I saved.  About all the supposed good I had done protecting.  But when it all came down to it I was just a murderer.  The council sent me after vampires who they deemed too dangerous.  And I did what they asked without question.  I never took a moral high ground like I had the day they asked me to kill myself.  I was being selfish, and that really was all it boiled down to, that was all people saw.  I was selfish.

I would never find redemption, I would never find salvation. I was going to hell.  No matter what the gods or the earth saw in me, I was a killer.  I dropped to the ground on my knees.  I didn't believe in god or gods or even that the forces out there granted wishes.  I just closed my eyes and curled up on the ground on my knees and forearms.  I just laid there.  I had nothing left in me to move forward.

A little bunny rabbit came up to me and sniffed my hands.  I looked up over my folded hands at the furry little animal.  It stared back at me.  I moved slowly, and I put my hand on the rabbit's furry.  It was silky and soft, it let me pet its fur.  The animal showed no fear.  I was hungry.  I could feel the pulse beneath my hand.  I grabbed the rabbit by the scruff of the neck and lifted it carefully off the ground and sat up.  I carefully cradled it in my arms as I bit softly into the animal's neck.  Animal blood tasted different than human blood did.  It didn't matter what kind of animal it was, it all tasted gamey.  I put the rabbit back on the ground and it looked up at me then scampered off.

At least some thing living trusted me not to kill it.  I smiled.  I got up and I started the walk back again.  I concentrated on one foot in front of the other, it was the only thing I could manage without the overwhelming depression hitting and I gave up again.  

The edge of a forest came into sight; I focused on the trees as they grew larger.  If I could just get there I could walk in the shadows back home.  If I could even call it home.  But it was where my family was.  I could not leave them.  

I finally reached the edge of the tree line and I stepped into the shadows and found Tony sitting at the edge of the village staring into the forest.  He smiled as he saw me step out of the shadows.  It was the last thing I saw before the darkness overwhelmed me and I collapsed.

I woke to the sun streaming into the window.  I was in a soft bed with clean sheets.  I looked around and I barely recognized anything, but I caught movement out of the corner of my eye.  Morgan was peering over the edge of the bed.  I smiled at her, she pounced on me.  "Mommy"

Tony peeked into the room, "You were really hungry, you need to eat more."

I sat up, "So why am I not hungry now?"

"Your three children have been feeding you; they've been sitting with you for the past day."   He frowned, "You okay?"

"I'd probably be still lying in a field if a kind little rabbit hadn't offered itself up to me."  He was still frowning, "You don't mean that do you?"

He shook his head and picked up Morgan, "Go play."  He sat down on the bed next to me, "You left angry.  I wasn't sure you'd come back."

"I only came back for the lot of you."  

He smiled, "Donatello wanted to send a search party after you.  He wanted to lead it.  He wanted to be the first to apologize.  I wouldn't let them.  I knew you'd come back but it didn't stop me from worrying."  He looked embarrassed by that admission.

I put my hand under his chin and made me look up at me, "I've given you reason to worry.  I worry about myself.  I don't think people understand that I blame myself more than they ever do."  I felt tears well up in my eyes.  I looked away from Tony.  He pulled me into his lap.  "If I'd done my job, Sierra and China might be alive.  I wouldn't have had to kill Johnny or my family.  Mia and Damian wouldn't be dead."

Tony held me tightly to him, "You are right, it's not your fault.  And I'm sorry you blame yourself."

A knock came from the door frame.  Tony whispered to me, "You've a visitor."

I turned to look at the figure standing in the doorway.  It was Donatello.  "You worried us.  But most importantly I'm sorry.  I wasn't implying anything, I was trying to understand.  I didn't realize that you had been blamed for this disaster.  Your consort told me what had happened.  He also told us how you felt."  He put his hand on the top of my head, "But child, you do not have to worry about the things you've done in the past, we accept you and who you are.  Or we should.  You don't have to walk away from us."

I looked up at him, "I didn't walk away for you. I walked away before I killed someone."  He pulled his hand back like I'd snapped at him.  He frowned at me then put his hand back on my head, "Sometimes you frighten me I cannot help my reaction."

Tony laughed, "She knows, she's use to it. There is no offense in your reaction."

I nodded, "I know I'm not the kindest person and I come off as unloving and uncaring."

Donatello smiled, "But you have a very large heart."
