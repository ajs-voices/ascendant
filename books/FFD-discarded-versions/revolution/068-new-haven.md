# New Haven

The pain had changed by the time I came around.  It was not the searing pain, more like being shocked instead of burned alive.  It was hard to open my eyes, when I tried the world was blurry.  Why was it always that way?  A thought for another time.  I tried to sit up and found I could not.  A soft voice came from above me, "Lay still, you are fine."

I blinked my eyes and saw a strange man looking down at me.  I tried to pull free but I was being restrained with silver chains.  "Where am I?"

The strange man smiled, "You don't know?  They said you'd say that?"

"They?"

"The people who brought you here of course."  He put a hand on my chest to keep from trying to sit up again, "They are fine, out in the town making themselves useful."

"Where am I?"

He smiled again, "New Haven."

I closed my eyes.  "I see now why I'm chained up.  I was not aware of where we were heading.  It had not been discussed.  I would never have entered on my own."

He laughed, "Your friends explained it all too well.  Banished from the clan, the ceremony took you out, yeah we got the drill.  And they said they didn't know about the covenant."  He smiled, "Well most of them didn't, two did however."

"Yes.  Ant and Ryan should have known better."

He laughed again, "They did. they waited for permission."

I glared at him.  "Then why am I chained up?"

He smiled, "To make sure when you woke you weren't in a frenzy."

I nodded.  "Let me go know then."

He shook his head, "A new covenant must be made."

I laughed, "I won't negotiate under chains."

He started to remove the chains, "Fair enough.  Your best behavior is required."

I nodded, "Of course, I don't just kill willy-nilly."

"I remember a time when you did."

I raised an eye brow, "You know me?"

He shook his head, "Know of you.  I know about the massacre and it's the reason why this covenant was made."

I sat up.  "Okay.  What do you have in mind?"

"Your friends say you are looking for allies against the New Order.  We wish to be a part of it with one stipulation."  I waited for him to continue he laughed softly to himself and muttered something I couldn't understand, "After your family your allegiance lies with us.  You protect our citizens first before anyone outside of your family."

I was intrigued, "That's all you want, my protection."

"Without the vampire council whatever the world brings, we want you to be our champion.  We want you to be our Hound instead of the councils, ours and ours alone."

"Do you intend to use me like the council, send me after your enemies?"

He shook his head.  "No, only our protection.  The acknowledge citizens of New Haven no matter their location would be able to call upon you for protection."

I smiled, "A glorified bodyguard?"

"Sort of."

"And if I agree you will help me take down the New Order?"

He nodded, "Yes."

"And you have the power to grant such an alliance?"

"I do."  He stood up and extended a hand.  "I am Davyn Erickson, I am the Jarl of New Haven.  I invoked the first covenant with your council after your massacre.  I invoke this covenant now with you personally. Il Cane, do you accept?"

"I have one more question. May we have residence here in New Haven?"

He smiled, "If you agree you are welcome to stay here for as long as a true death does not take you or your kin."

I nodded, "I accept."  I took his hand and we shook on it.  I hadn't expected to feel such a rush of power radiate from our handshake, but it did.  I could feel new people not like a bond, more like a kinship, as if they were of my own blood.  "That's a powerful spell."

Davyn smiled proudly.  "I'm sure you have a few tricks up your sleeves as well Il Cane."

"Cari please. No need to scare your... our vampire children."

"You are a bright young woman." He laughed, "Sometimes I forget you are nearly as old as I am in relative terms.  We are not blood, but it is much like the clan bond, but more connected.  We are blood by magic if that makes sense."

I nodded.  "Can I see my family?"

"I will not keep you from them.  They are building you a forge for some mysterious purpose they will not reveal."

"I can show you what they intend to make."  He nodded and I stepped away from him and drew two shadow swords from nothing."  

Davyn stared in awe.  "And you intend to make these for whom?"

"Whoever wants one.  Well that's the theory, we have to find the means to make more my supply is limited."
