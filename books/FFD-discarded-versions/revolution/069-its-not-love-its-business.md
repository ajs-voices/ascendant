# It's Not Love It's Business

Davyn nodded, "This is what you were banished for."  He shook his head.  "Some people have no perception of the issues at hand.  We will assist you in this if you'll let us."

"Fine with me, the biggest problem is finding the materials."  

Davyn smiled, "I might be able to get you some help there.  Give me a day or two."

I nodded.  "Is this all we have to discuss?"

He shook his head with a frown, "No, but it's not a topic I think you will take lightly."

"Oh?"

"I propose marriage."

I blinked and stared at him.  "You and me?"

He nodded.  "Yes.  It would be a business arrangement.  You are powerful in your own right and you are beautiful, but I am in love with another and I know you do not practice monogamy well.  I do not wish to be your lover only to cement our agreement and our future.  Sex would be required but only to cement the binding and if we wanted children of our own."

I smiled, "How does this protect the future?"

Davyn smiled, "A union between the primeval blood line and the modern vampire bloodlines.  You are not of them, but they respect you."

"They do not respect me, they fear me."

He laughed, "That may have been so at one time, but now, they respect you.  They realize in all the fear the council pushed down on them life in the New Order is not right.  You are no longer controlled, and your alliance and marriage to me would cement their knowledge that you won't get out of hand.  And I can protect you from the damages that will fallout when you kill Brandon Holt."

"You wish to protect me from my own devices?"

"In a manner of speaking.  But I do not want to harness you in anyway, only give people that perspective.  I know you are fully capable of controlling yourself.  I've watched you since then and I will continue to do so."

I nodded.  "Let me talk with my people, and I'll get back to you on that."

He smiled, "I knew you would say that.  But the sooner we do this, the sooner it's over and we can go back to our own loves."

I smiled, "Where is my family?"

Davyn lead me to the door.  It opened out into the town streets.  "They have chosen an old warehouse to refit for your needs."  He pointed me in the right direction.

I laughed, "You discussed everything with them and knew my answer."

He smiled, "But of course.  Your Ryan seems to have better understanding of you than most.  And your son is a very close second.  When they agreed on certain things I knew I would have my answer."

"Did they ever disagree?"

He laughed, "No."

I smiled, "They are two of the same.  I'm glad they are bound for life."  I started to walk away but Davyn put his hand on my arm.

"You can take Your Ryan back as lesser.  I think it may be necessary."

I smiled.  "Ryan deserves a break from my mind."

"He is always yours, is he not?"

"Yes he will be.  But he is free of my mind now.  He stays because he wants to not because he has to."

Davyn nodded, "I will see you again then."

I nodded then left to find my family.

I found Ant and Ryan with Jesse in the warehouse they were refitting to our needs.  It was probably the best solution.  Make the building fit for living in the way we desire instead of having to do so with already existing house and walls.  This made sense.

Ryan smiled when he saw me.  "About time you woke up."

I smiled, "I'm awake, but there is still some lingering energy or something."

Ant came over, "You still are in pain?"

I patted Ants arm, "Nothing I can't handle.  So you've been talking with Davyn?"

They both blushed in embarrassment.  Ant was the first to speak.  "It is a good fit.  He's not like my father.  He won't try to make you what you aren't.  It'll give us a home and the children will be able to grow up in an environment where they aren't judged."

"They could do that without the marriage."

Ant smiled, "Yes, but you need a grounding point, someone who isn't with you all the time."

Ryan stepped in, "We think that is why you and Tony did so well apart.  He grounded you.  You don't have that now."

I nodded, "So you are all for it, all of you?"

Ant and Ryan nodded, Jesse shook his head, "I wasn't consulted and it's not my place to offer opinion."

"And why not?"  He was just as much family now as anyone else that followed me.

"I'm not family, kin or even a close friend."

Ant laughed, "You really don't know Cari well do you?"

Ryan smiled, "You followed her away from your clan.  You were banished with us.  You are family.  And besides you've been in her bed more times than I can count.  You get a say in the matter."

"See Jesse, you get a say.  Now what's have you got to say about the matter?"

He smiled, "I'm glad you feel I'm part of this, but I don't feel part of it.  But I'm concerned."

We all asked together, "About?"

Jesse laughed, "Geez.  I'm concerned you are going to fall head over heels like you did with my baby brother."

Ryan chided, "Jealous?"

Jesse frowned and shook his head, "We don't know him.  He could have another motive to bind you to him."

"And do we not have a motive outside of what you shared with him?  To ground me?"

He nodded, "I guess, but it won't hurt him."

I laughed, "You think being bound to me is easy?  Ryan is it?"

Ryan shook his head.  "Not easy, but I wouldn't have traded it for the world."

"So Jesse, your concerns are valid, but they aren't enough to not do this.  Unless there is something more?"

He blushed, "You know me better than I thought.  I wanted to be in your bed."

I walked over to Jesse and put my arms around his neck and smiled up at him, "That won't change, he promised me that."

Jesse kissed me softly.  It had been a while since we'd been together.  He held me close then said, "We have things to finish here.  Go marry your new beau."

I laughed and pulled away from Jesse's embrace, it felt nice to know he didn't hate me like his brother.  "I don't think it has to be done now.  I want to see what the plan is."
