# The Meeting

Ryan and Tony had caught up to me.  They watched me stare at the door.  I was immovable.  I was petrified to go in that door.  Ryan must have felt the tension, he put his arm around my shoulder and leaned in to whisper, "It'll be okay.  Let's go find out what they want."

I reached for the door handle, but the door opened before I could turn it.  Aurora smiled at me, but it didn't reach her eyes.  Something was seriously wrong.  She moved out of the way with her arm extended as a welcoming jester.

I walked in, Ryan and Tony behind me, no one else had followed us up the stairs.  Not even Johnny.  Tony joined his father.  The room was full of the most powerful vampires in the entire world.  It was not a good sign.

Sal, my typical council contact, started the meeting.  "Welcome Cari.  I know you know Francesco.  I'll let him make the proper introductions."  He stepped back and Francesco took his place.

Francesco smiled at me.  We had not seen each other in many centuries.  "This here is Charles Dennis, our prime minister."  The prime minister was in his early forties with salt and pepper hair that he pulled off well.  "And you know my son.  Antonio."

I interrupted, "Tony."

He smiled at me with knowing eyes.  When Tony and I had first met, Tony was only ten years old.  He informed me his name was 'Tony' and continued to spell it 'T O N Y' in a very condescending fashion. I couldn't help but smile back.  Francesco continued, "Yes.  He is if you'll pardon the coincidence, our Enforcer.  We are here to discuss a problem that plagues all vampires and humans a-like."

Sal stepped forward again on cue.  "We have a problem.  And these are your objectives."  Sal laid down a picture of a man I vaguely remembered seeing before somewhere.

Francesco spoke calmly.  "This is Brandon Holt, my brother."  There was a pause punctuation by stunned silence from the rest of the room.  He picked up quickly as if trying to explain, but he didn't, "You need to kill him.  Tony will help you, though your council seems to believe you can do it without his help.  But he is our problem, and Tony needs your help."

Sal laid down a second picture.  I clearly recognized him; Valence Dilanti was an Enforcer like me.  "You need to kill him."  The third picture Sal laid down made me stare at him in confusion.

Every eye in the room was down cast, no one wanted to look at me, nor the picture of me lying on the table.  "You need to kill her."

I stood there in stunned silence.  Ryan's hand was on his sword.  Aurora stood up and looked at me, "Is there no other way?"  She addressed the room, not me specifically.  

At least one person was on my side.  Sal glared at his wife.  "No, she's gone rogue once before, we cannot risk it again."

A rage filled my soul, but my voice was quiet, cold and distant, "I've not killed ONE human in over eight hundred years."

Sal turned his glare to me.  "These are your orders.  This is not a negotiation."

I don't know what came over me - fury, rage, and hatred, maybe all of them.  "Fine!  You want me gone.  I will go but I will not kill anyone either."  And with that I stepped into the shadows and left them staring at where I use to stand.  I didn't care where I went, I just stepped from shadow to shadow.  I let the anger take me where ever it would.  I could feel Ryan drawing closer.   Someone was pulling him towards me through the shadows.  I blocked every connection to me.  I clamped my shields shut tighter than I ever had in my entire life.

I walked in the shadows until near dawn.  My final step was into a grand forest deep in the Rocky Mountains, in the shadows stood a girl of about sixteen.  She smiled at me.  "Mother said you were coming.  I didn't believe her.  How could anyone appear in the shadows?  But here you are."

"Is it here?"  It was cryptic, but she nodded, "Take me to it please."  I reached out with all my power and set up wards, no one would find me without losing themselves first.

She offered me her hand and I took it.  I felt a calmness wash over me as her magic added to my shields.  "It will protect us both I think."  She smiled.  "My name is Ayeshea, but you can call me Thea.  What can I call you?"

"Cari."  

Her smile widened.  "We are here.  She put her hands on a round stone, and a hidden door opened."  A whoosh of air flooded inside the room, the room was dark but Thea raised her hands and four torches lit the darkness in an eerie glow.  A coffin sat in the middle directly under a skylight.  "Quickly it will be daylight."

I got in the coffin and Thea put an IV in my arm and checked the connections. I turned to her, "In ten years send message to Tony Giovanni and bring him here."  Thea nodded and I laid back and pulled the lid shut.  It was heavy; the silver lining it matched the lining of body itself.  It would keep me in and vampires out.  Once the lid was shut it locked on the outside and I heard Thea attach the padlock to it.  I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.  I was dead to the world!
