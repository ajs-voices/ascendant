# The Dream Diner

The forest was quiet, it was quite enjoyable.  I could hear the critters scampering around and the birds sang.  There was no danger here, not even if a pack of werewolves lived in these woods.  I sat down with my back against a fallen try.  The quiet and serenity of the area was good for my anxiety.  The past many years had been hard on people, and many people blamed me.  I tried not to blame myself but my own anger at my own selfishness washed away all my trying.

I closed my eyes to concentrate on my own thoughts, and push away the negative ones. 

My thoughts came in waves.  First I saw my own memories, my first moment of weakness when I killed the villagers.  I felt their corpses; I felt the weight of their bodies as I drank them dry.  I saw the dreams I had when I was asleep.  The Twin Towers falling the multiple nukes going off.  I saw all the destruction that Brandon and Valence had caused.  I felt my friends being tortured.  Their deaths at my hands stabbed through my heart like a knife.  Tristan's betrayal ripped through my body in a gut wrenching swing.  

I saw things that I had not experienced in my life.  I dreamt of a diner.  I had been there before, long ago.  A man sat in a booth with his back to me.  I didn't know who he was but I felt an urgent need to find him.  And then I felt the enormous pressure of being cast away from the Clan.  Sadness overwhelmed me and I started awake.  I could still feel the magic inside me.  That fertility statue had done more than give me twins.  Their own bodies fought me, and they fought each other.  This was going to be a rough pregnancy.  I sighed as I stood up to head back to the village.  I knew I had to do something.  The diner was next on my list.  I had to go.  And I had to go now.

I found Ryan and Jesse hunting items for the forge they were building.  When I told them what I was doing they smiled and nodded.  Ryan never questioned me. I was surprised when Jesse did not.  It made me sad to know that if I had went to find Tony he would not have been like his brother, he would have questioned and he would have insisted on coming with me.  I sighed, the feelings from the dreams still lingered in my body almost as strong as they had been in the dream.

I didn't exactly know where the diner was, but I didn't need to have to know an exact location to shadow walk to someone as long as I knew who I wanted to go to I could typically find a shadow nearby.  I still wasn't exactly sure of the feeling, but I had to go, it was important.  I stepped into the shadow and found myself in the shadow of the very diner I wanted to go to.  There was no one around, the city, the town or wherever I was, was quiet.  Many cities were like that now, it was sad.  I expanded my senses to see if anyone was near or if there were any threats, finding none, I entered the diner.

I was surprised to see the same image I saw in my dream.  A man who looked vaguely familiar sat in a booth with his back to me.  The diner was empty except for the two of us.  He never turned around as I walked toward him, though I knew he was aware of the fact that I was there.  

He spoke softly when I reached his side, "I wasn't sure if you would come."

I sat down opposite him and looked at the man I had dreamt about with a bit of confusion.  He smiled at me, "I had a dream I'd meet you here."  He blushed, "It wasn't the first dream I've had about you."  He laughed, "I don't even know you."  He looked up, "Do I?"

I shook my head, "No.  I had a dream about you."

He smiled at me and stuck his hand out.  "I'm Jake Marshall."

I hesitated to shake his hand.  "Do you have a brother?"

He nodded, "Two.  Tristan and Nick."

It was my turn to look down.  "I knew Tristan."

"Knew him?"  He asked.

"He died."

He nodded.  He didn't seem surprised.  I didn't want to explain that I'd killed him, and that he was a traitor.  But it made me wonder if Jake was part of the New Order or not.

"There is something you aren't telling me, isn't there?"  He was very intuitive, he must share his brother's empathic ability, or so that was my theory.

"Yes.  It's not something good",  I paused, I didn't know how to put it.  "He was a traitor.  I guess it's a matter of perspective.  He betrayed me and the coalition."

"But he was leading it."  Jake at least knew the ins and outs of that.

I nodded, "He was placed from the very beginning to get close to me.  He was sent to meet up with my friends and family and wait for me."

"Why would they want that?"  

"I'm their biggest threat."  It was a statement of fact, I wasn't bragging.  

Jake nodded slowly. "That isn't all is it?"

I smiled, "Empath?"

He nodded.  I answered his question, "He was mine and my lover's lover."

He blushed.  "Is he a vampire too?  Dark hair and eyes, really cute?"

I cocked my head to the side curiously, "Yeah.  How did you know that?"

Jake's blush deepened, "I've dreamt about him too."

I bit my lip in what I hoped was understanding.  "You like men."  

Jake looked down.  I lifted his head with my finger so I could look into his eyes, "I don't mind.  I go either way myself."  He brightened slightly.

The door I had come in opened and I saw a familiar face walk in.  Not one I had thought I would see ever again.  I stood up and looked down at Jake then back at the new comer.  I smiled.  "Nick.  What are you doing here?"  And then it dawned on me they were brothers.

I shook my head.  "I get it now."

Jake looked up at me, "Get what?"

"What Tristan did."

Nick sat down with his brother.  They looked nothing alike, but yet I knew that they were brothers.  All three of the brothers were empaths and pretty strong ones too.

I explained, "The lot of you are connected aren't you?"  They nodded.  "Tristan used that connection.  He knew Nick and I knew each other intimately.  And you Jake, well you like men.  He used you two to make Tony and I fall for him."  I looked to Jake, "That's why you dreamt about us."

Nick smiled, "I've had dreams about you too I thought it was just nostalgia.  I guess not."

Jake elbowed his brother, "What you doing here?"

Nick laughed, "I dreamt about seeing you here.  I had to come and see.  I didn't see her though."

"Now the question is why did we all come here?"  It was curious why we had all dreamt of coming here and meeting each other.  "Though I don't think we should sit around her to figure it out."

The men nodded and got up, Jake asked, "I have no place to go."  Nick agreed.

"I can take us to my friends and family."  I lead the way to the shadows outside the dinner.  They had only gotten darker with the sun going down.  I offered each of them a head.  "It's a little disorienting, but it'll get us there."  They each took a hand and I stepped into the shadows with them.
