# Vengeance

The next couple of days I relearned many things.  I still had trouble getting past my own pulse.  It made almost everything I did uneasy and awkward.  I practiced with my swords from sun up to sun up, with very little break between.  Ant stayed with me, he helped me to gather my wits about me as I did for him when he was a little boy.  He was repaying the favor, not that it was anything I didn't want to do.  He stayed with me even though he could have been with the Circle of Elders planning for our next battle.  I even told him he could go, but he stayed with me.  I think he liked the sun as much as I did.  The girls definitely did, they played all day in the sun.  They would play with Leyla and Lee in the bright sun shine.  It was a wonderful sight to watch.

The day finally came that Tony and the circle had a plan, one that just needed to be executed.  Tony had pulled me and Ant into a meeting.  The table was covered with maps and scraps of paper.  I took everything in.  The main focus was on an old warehouse building.  That was the cannery Valence ran.  I still thought it was such a strange name for a blood bank.  But then again I suspect it was more like a canning plant than a blood bank, except their stock was human blood and their cattle were squeezed into spaces no man or woman should live in.  From the population numbers and the size of the cattle areas I knew it was probably only standing room.  It was no way to live at all.  Valence did not care, he just wanted his world. He wanted to rule with impunity.  He was a god in the world's eyes.  He and Brandon would die.  I would see to it, even if it was the last thing I did.

No one spoke when I had come into the room.  They just watched me as I took everything in.  I saw red X's in places.  Circles in other and dotted lines depicting guard paths.  I looked at Tony.  He smiled and he nodded.  Everyone sat down in their seats.  I stood above the map.  Tony stood beside me.  "The red X's are where silver guns are probably at, leaders, armories and high ranking officers.  The circles are stationary guards.  Our intel says there do not have silver.  The paths are the movements of the rotation of guards.  They change guards about every four hours, but it's a random interval."

Tony picked up a letter opener and drove it into an area on the map.  "That is where Valence is."

Another man picked up a green pen and started marking small x's on the map.  "These are cameras."  He picked up another pen, purple this time.  "These are heat sensors."  He looked up at me.  "You have to worry about them now."

I shook my head.  "No."  

Ant smiled, "We can control our body temperature.  It is the first thing we go over in basic training.  Cari may be new to being alive, but she is not new to technological advances like that.  She would typical show up as a cold spot.  She had to learn to regulate her body temperature to match the environment.  She is completely invisible when she wants to be."

Tony smiled, "See I told you she doesn't care about cameras and heat sensors.  Why do you doubt me?"

The all laughed softly as Tony chided the man.  He looked embarrassed.  I put my hand on his, "It is good information none-the-less.  We can use it."

He looked up at me.  I picked up my hand and raised a small flame above my palm. "Distraction."

He smiled at me.  I looked at Tony, "What's the plan?"

"You tell me?  I know you see it."  I smiled.  I took a pencil and I drew on the map our path.  I circled the distractions and the places we needed to hit.  

Tony nodded and frowned, "You intend to free them too?"

I looked at him, "Of course.  It's a perfect distraction."

"Who do you want to go with you?  You won't do this alone."  Tony looked concerned.

"It's your operation. I will do as I'm told."

Tony smiled, "Who do you want to go with you?  How would be most beneficial?"

I took a deep breath and looked at Tony.  He smiled, "You don't have to need me."

I smiled and kissed his cheek, "I think Ant would be best."

Tony laughed, "I figured so.  He kills two birds with one stone.  You get to have a tighter connection and he'll base you like he's been doing the past few days.  I'm man enough to know that I'm not what you need in battle."

Donatello laughed, "You are a bigger man than most if you give your consort over to your son for protection."

Tony smiled, "He's not protection.  He's a base.  Ryan and Ant have been with Cari through it all.  She trusts them with her life.  And her theirs."

Donatello smiled, "Like I said a bigger man than most."

The remaining time in the meeting was spent organizing the distractions.  We would make our move at dawn.  Walking in the daylight was never a better distraction.  And that alone would make Valence afraid.  

I tried to sleep.  But I couldn't.   The girls were staying behind.  It made me nervous.  Tony was sound asleep as I paced the floor back and forth.  I sat down on the couch to rest, but all I heard was my own heartbeat.  It made me get up and pace more.  I heard movement from one of the rooms.  I put my hand on the hilt of my sword ready for an attack, but it was only Ryan.  He came out rubbing his eyes.  "You really should sleep."

"I can't."  

He sat down on the couch, threw his legs up and leaned against the arm and patted the place between his legs.  "Come sit."  

I did as I was instructed.  He pulled me down to lay on top of him.  My head lay on his chest.  I could hear his hear beat, the comforting rhythm.  I closed my eyes and I focused on his heart beat and I drifted off to sleep.

At first the dreams were peaceful, starting out with Tony as a boy around the fountain.  Then the dreams turned grim.  A figure in dark robes chocked Tony.  And then it was me.  I was killing the little boy.  But it wasn't Tony anymore.  I was at the village I had slaughtered.  I felt each throat beneath my fingers.  I tasted every last drop of their blood as I drained it.  

I woke up with Ryan pushing me off of him.  He was trying to escape.  I looked at him and stared back at me with a shocked expression.  And then he pulled me close, "It's okay.  I didn't know what was happening.  You were asleep and then you bit me."

I closed my eyes.  "I'm sorry.  The dreams are back."

He held me close.  "It's okay."  He rubbed my back and his heart started to calm, and he was again at peace.  

I sighed with a deep breath.  "I'm sorry."

Ryan rocked me back and forth, "It's okay, it's new. It's all so new.  I just wish I was in your head, I could help more."

"I don't want you to die with me."

He put his cheek against the top of my head, "I know, but I would if you asked me to."

"I know I can't ask that of you or Ant."  

He pulled me away from him and I looked up at him, "We both will die for you."

I smiled, "I know Ry.  But you must live if I die.  I can't have you dead too.  Someone has to look after the girls."

He pulled me back in, "Okay, I promise.  But don't you die on me so soon."

I laughed, "I'll try."

We slept in peace or we tried.  We were both only half asleep most of the time.  But we were rested when Tony came and woke us up.  "It's time."

I changed my clothes.  I wore all black.  Tony leered at me when he saw what I was wearing.  He'd seen them before I was sure of it, but his look made me blush.  He and Ryan laughed at my reaction.  I smiled and shook my head at them.  "Let's go."

Ant fell in step with me.  He too was wearing all black.  He handed me a pair of sun glasses.  "These should fit."

I put them on and I danced around the ground and found they fit well. They didn't slide when I moved.  I smiled, "Thank you."

The circle of elders stood amongst the crowd and waited.  There were several groups of vampires and humans.  I saw Alec and Valentine and Francesco and Aurora.  Alec smiled, "We brought some help.  We can't help directly but we brought human and Therian."  

Dimitri stepped out of the middle of the crowd, "And I brought some additional Therians, all pledge to Il Cane's service."

I nodded, "It is an honor."  

Donatello smiled, "Everyone is in their units.  If you are all ready, at first, light walk."

I grabbed Tony and pulled him into me and I kissed him hard and knew that it could be our last.  He picked me up and I wrapped my arms and legs around him.  He held me close.  He set me down and smiled. "We will see each other again."

I nodded and took Ant's hand when the first ray of light hit the crystal in the middle of the camp we walked.

Ant and I stood in the shadows of the buildings just outside the Cannery.  It looked quiet.  Most of the people out would be humans.  The vampires would sleep.  We had that advantage.  Tony's group was going to be the first distraction.  They were going to set free the human prisoners.  Ryan and his group were going to provide distractions inside of their compound.  

We did not have a subtle plan.  It was noisy and presumptuous.  But we had the advantage.  When the alarms sounded Ant and I drew our weapons and we walked into the sunlight and we walked right up to their gates.  Bullets started to fly.  We blocked most with our weapons but a few hit us.  They hardly slowed us.  The gate on the other hand was a bit of a troublesome thing.  Ant started using his vampire strength to tear it open.  But we were getting fired upon.  I closed my eyes and I prayed to whatever gods would listen and I raised my hands.  Pillars of flame rose from the stone walls and the men in the middle cried out in pain.  I fought the urge to wretch at the smell. It was harder than I thought to do but I did not lose my breakfast.

Ant broke the last bolt free and gate fell inward and we walked into the cannery unhindered.  We walked through men and woman, slicing and dicing as if they were nothing more than the air.  Everything felt as if it was in slow motion.   But things were happening so fast, it was hard to keep straight.  We followed our path.  We avoided the silver but that was part of Ryan's job, to distract them so we could get to Valence.

We walked into the compound.  There was a mad dash in the direction of their cattle. Everyone was running that direction.  Ant and I veiled ourselves in our shadows, they never even saw us.  We set our body temperatures and we walked into Valence's office.  The room felt extremely power heavy.  He was trying to control us.  I dropped my veil I smiled at him and he stared at me in horror.  Ant moved with in the shadows around his back.  Valence pulled a gun and aimed it at me. 

He started to pull the trigger and Ant drew his sword down on his gun hand and it fell to the ground in a clatter.  Valence yowled in pain.  Ant spun quickly and easily and off came his head.  I smiled.  I picked up Valences head and burnt his body.  I carried his dripping head down the hall.  I stood in the middle of their cannery. "Who's next?"  I yelled into the fighting.  All of Valence's men stared up at me, mine continued to fight and took down several more men before Tony yelled for them to Hold.  

All of Valence's men turned their weapons on me.  And that was all that Tony needed before he reached out with is power and they burst into flames.  The urge to vomit overcame me and I let it.  There was little danger now.  The contents of my stomach lay on the ground with the burnt masses of men.  In the distance you could hear cheering.  I could barely make it out.  Ant put his hand on my shoulder, "They shout freedom and Il Cane.  You did right."

I smiled, "We did right.  We all did."
