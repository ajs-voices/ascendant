# The Caestus

We returned with the artifacts and new buzz started in the village.  What did we bring back?  What does it do?  I really hoped they never found out.  All the items except those Ryan held were taken to the circle's meeting room.  Deja Vu all over again, another government trying to learn from the things that should not have been taken out.  I took the book from Ryan's bag and placed it carefully in a room under a veil.  It was not a book I was willing to part with.  It was my own personal notes and research.  Not a journal, but notes on what I had learned over the centuries studying the items.   And when I was done I locked it away with the most dangerous of things.  I didn't want anyone getting their hands on it.  But we needed the information. I didn't want to screw my own plans up by forgetting something.

The metal rods didn't clang in my pockets thankfully no one really remembered me putting them there.  The leather cords were not really of a magical sort, just an element to make something I intended to share.  I only hoped that the circle would let me hide the remainder of the secrets.  Nothing was meant to be used.  They were too dangerous to use and more dangerous to destroy.

When I got into the meeting room packs were being opened and the room was buzzing with questions and they were exploring things haphazardly.  I spoke quietly.  "Do Not Touch Anything."

The men and women in the room stared at me in shock.  I glared back at them.  "These things are not for you to use.  They are to be restored into their vaults.  They are not your answers."

Everyone including Donatello stammered their excuses.  "No."  I stretched out my powers and I shielded and veiled the items from view.  No one would touch or see the items that Aurora had found.  "No one is to use them."

A man I did not know his name stepped in front of me and loomed over me trying to make me cower.  He yelled at me, "You have no right, Mongrel.  You are not Clan no matter what the magic says."

I laughed.  "I have every right.  I was their Keeper before and I am their Keeper now.  I was entrusted with their safety.  Not you, not this clan, not even your bloodline.  I WAS.  If anyone has a claim to be Keeper of Secrets I will gladly hand it over if you can find the items."

That made people leap and scramble for the items they knew were there.  But they weren't.  The good thing about shields and veils and being powerful in Shadow was that you could easily move items through the shadows without stepping yourself.  

Donatello smiled at me from across the room.  "Well played.  I trust you'll care for them."

I nodded, "I do have a secret I will share with you, but I have to prepare first."

Donatello nodded, "I figured you would offer something for our efforts."

I glared back at him.  They had done nothing.  I turned and left the room while the circle clamored over themselves trying to find the artifacts.

I went back to where I had stashed the book and pulled it out of its hiding.  I sat down at the Meelah's kitchen table with the large leather bound book.  Ryan and Ant stood behind me as if they were shielding me from prying eyes, but I know they were both curious as to what I had.  

Ant asked, "What's this?"

"It's my notes on the things I studied in the vaults.  It is the only thing that I will let others read.  It has no magic in and of itself.  You or the rest of the circle cannot do most of these as the actual rituals are in my head or in the original books.  Think of this like a catalog."

Ryan smiled and then frowned, "Jack would have loved putting this into the modern age for you."

I nodded, "He would have.  Maybe if things get put back together we can find someone to do so in his memory."

Ryan laughed, "The Jackapedia."

Ant laughed their joke was mostly lost on me.

Ryan tried to explain the Wikipedia website and the internet and I just ignored his technobabble.  I really wasn't interested.  "One day I'll get you on the computer."

Ant shook his head, "I doubt that.  I can't get her to use a firearm, and they've been around much longer than the internet."

Ryan smiled, "Yeah, but a gun doesn't let her get up and personal with her marks.  That's why she won't use one.  I bet you she's better at it than you, me, Tony or any other sniper you find.  The internet is useful I bet I can get her to use it when things are normal again."

Ant held out his hand, "I'll take both bets."  They shook on it.  Ant leaned down and spoke in my ear, "You willing to shoot a gun for me?"

I turned and looked up at him with a smile, "If we get to work now."

He took a step back in shock, "Seriously you'll shoot a gun for me?"

"If we get to work now."

He nodded.  "So what are you looking for?"

I pulled a cord from around my neck that held two small discs of metal and held them up.  "The Caestus creation information."

Ant pulled his from around his neck and Ryan pulled his set out of his pocket.  Ryan's were different they held a gem in the center.

We flipped through the book in my hand writing.  The text was small and fading but it was still readable.  Ryan put his finger on one page.  "Here."

I pulled the tome closer and started reading my notes.  It was a quick read, and all I needed was a forge. "Just need a forge.  I have a limited supply of metal."  I pulled the metal rods out and placed them in the middle of the book.  I handed Tony one.  "This is for the circle to study.  One is for you.  Two I am holding in reserve, it's a feeling I have.  Six saved for the children.  The remaining 10 are for the circle to determine their use.  They are bound to a specific vampire and cannot be shared."

I got up and smiled, "Meelah can you gather the circle outside near the fire, and I will share."

She nodded and did what I asked of her without question. 

Ant and Ryan grabbed a few of the leather cords on the table and I did the same.  Caestus were leather strap gloves used in the gladiator rings.  We could probably do better with today's technology, but this is what we had then, and it will work for us now.  The three of us strapped our metal discs on each hand.  Technically the metal discs were to be numerous and to help inflict more damage on impact, these had a different purpose.

We went outside and found the circle and most of the village on the village green.  Tony stood with his grandfather and, there was a man I had met before standing with the circle.  I hadn't known he had been here.  I walked up to him but did not smile. I tried not to glare at him, "Jesse."

He smiled at me, "I'm enforcer here."

I nodded, "Donatello didn't tell me.  He sent you after me?"

He shook his head and Donatello stammered the mere thought of it, Jesse laughed, "I hunt you for fun."

I glared at him and sighed, "It's a good thing, or you'd never have been paid."

Tony glared at the two of us,  "You two know each other?"

"Cari and I have had a few run ins.  I tend to hunt her to test my mettle on the best.  I've only caught up to her a few times mostly because she wanted me to."  Jesse laughed.  "And you must be the Daddy."

Tony stared at him in confusion.  Jesse motioned to Ant.  "To the lad over there.  She never would tell me whose he was.  If I'd know he'd been Giovanni I'd probably have stayed away."

Tony turned his full glare to me, "I don't want to know do I?"

I shook my head. "Probably not."

He huffed in anger.

I around the two men and handed Donatello the ten remaining rods.  "This is all I have left.  A forge and my knowledge and I can create ten more identical to what we are about to show you.  Tony has one that is for the circle to study, so you can find more metal needed to make more."

Donatello nodded, "How did you find this metal?"

"I didn't, it was stashed in one of the vaults.  I only studied it.  And of the items you've found these are the only viable option of to use today."

Ryan stepped out into the middle of the village green.  "Ryan has a different version of the same thing.  The crystal in the middle absorbs vampire powers."  I threw a bolt of fire at Ryan.  He smiled as it was absorbed into the crystal and metal disc.  He willed two flaming swords to his hands.  "The vampire magic is channeled through the crystal into the metal where a weapon is formed of the user's choice.  The discs are bound to a specific user.  No one can use another.  The binding magic is what finishes the piece."

Donatello nodded, "So you cannot finish the pieces when you make them."  I nodded.

Ant pulled out two flaming swords.  And I explained, "A vampire can push their power into the disc and a weapon of their choice.  Ant is strongest in elemental magic he prefers fire but can push whatever element he wants."

I stepped into the clearing and willed two shadow swords.  "It takes practice to wield two weapons.  Most can only do one.  We've been working for centuries to master two weapons."  I released the power.

"Empathy,  Domination, Auspex and Animal Ken all are weird, but they are still deadly.  Empathy typically yields a crystalline weapon."  I drew upon my empathy and pushed the crowd's feelings into it.  "The emotion you push will make the crystalline structure a different color, or in this case multiple colors as it is multiple feelings.  Auspex and Domination are nearly invisible and is more deadly because the opponent can't see it as readily.  Animal Ken yields fur covered weapons."  I drew upon the Animal Ken and the swords looked like I was wagging two stiff tails at them.  The crowd laughed.  "It may look a sight but it is as deadly as any of the others.  I willed one sword into shadow and the other into fire.  "If you have the strength you can maintain two of different types."  I let them go.  "Even with my practice I cannot wield it for long."

Jesse clapped.  "So when do I get one?"

I smiled, "As soon as a forge is made so I can render the discs."

He smiled at me, "What can I do to help?"

Ryan stepped forward, "You can come with me and we'll start making the forge.  It's be a while, but I'm sure we can get what she needs."  They left talking about their upcoming project.  

"Any other questions?"

A female in the back shouted, "What about Necromancy?"  Another man shouted "And Dream Walking".

I shook my head, "I do not know.  Ant and myself are not strong enough in either to test more than a glimpse.  But if I had to guess, Necromancy would be like Shadow, a dark misty weapon and Dream Walking like the other mental abilities, Domination and Auspex."

They nodded, and Donatello questioned, "How did you figure this out?"

I smiled, "I read a book about it from many centuries before I was born.  It detailed the creation procedure, and many other uses for the techniques but I was only interested in the weapon aspect.  It is too dangerous to have the book.  The book was locked away shortly after it was written.  It is not meant to be shared.  Each Keeper can pass along what information they feel necessary.  There are many structures and rules even the eldest of us do not know.  Things change, but a True Keeper can understand it and pass it along."

"You're a mongrel how can you be a True Keeper?"

I walked away.  I wasn't going to answer the question.  I heard Donatello step in, "She is a True Keeper despite her origins.  She can read the texts that we have forgotten.  She really is a True Keeper it is not our ways to doubt the First magic."

I was tired.  Tired of this war and tired of people who always questioned me.  I walked into forest, I needed to be alone, or as alone as I could get.
