# The Nightmare

At first my undead sleep was calm.  I relished the peace, the quiet, the blissful solitude that the torpor brought with it.  It was not a complete torpor for me.  I'd learned over the centuries that after years of not feeding my blood lust would be nearly uncontrollable.  The IV feed me a continuous but slow stream of blood.  The pulse of the IV kept me on the edge of a full torpor but never going over.

I dreamt of the time I went rogue.  The killing played in my head over and over again.  I could feel their bodied in my arms, taste their blood and feel their throats rip from their bodies as I ravaged their town.  I saw Nicola's face in my mind as I fed on her.  I felt her pulse slip from me as I dropped her on the ground.  I left the child's body intact.  I don't know why I had, but I was glad of it now.  

Nicola appeared alive and well in my dream.  She asked, "Where are you?"  I knew it wasn't real.  We had no connection of any sort; it was just a make-shift family we had created as a punishment for killing her family and friends.

My dream switched to something not of my own memories.  I saw planes flying into skyscrapers - The Twin Towers in New York City to be exact.  The towers fell in a mass of chaos and devastation.  

Images of destruction flickered through my mind.  First it was only The Twin Towers.  Then soon all of Manhattan lay in ruin.  A large mushroom cloud rose above the ruins that had once been one of the greatest cities in the world.  

The images flickered to Washington, DC.  The White House was in shambles, and the Washington Monument was felled like timber in a logging camp.  Lincoln's head lay decapitated from his body and the rest of the monument was a mound of rubble.

Fires and explosions scorched the earth around the country. Everything that separated America from a third world nation was destroyed - oil refineries, power plants, dams, military bases and much more.

My dream changed again. Masses of people ran and shouted.  Men and women fell to an unknown pursuer.  Some were trampled; others were helped up only to be shot from behind.  Searing pain shot through my body and then blackness.  I thought the dream was over.  I relaxed but as soon as I sighed my insides felt like they were on fire.

And then the pain changed and seconds later it was another pain.  The pain never left.  I couldn't sleep.  I pounded on the silver lining of the coffin above me for someone to let me out.  My hands burned at the mere touch of the silver.  I screamed, "Let me out."

My voice grew hoarse, I stopped screaming.  I stopped fighting.  I could do nothing but feel the pain.  I tried to enjoy the pain like so many other times before, but it was not mine.  I tried to force my mind into the quietness, but I could never reach it.  It was almost there and then the pain would be strong than it had been moments before.

There was nothing but the pain, it went on and on without pause.  Time was irrelevant, it didn't matter if it was day or night, everything blurred together and all I thought about was the pain.  

I heard the latch moving on the outside.  It startled me.  I started to shake, my body hurt.  I couldn't think straight.  I cringed against the silver lined walls, burning my skin.  I pulled away as the lid was lifted off and fell to the ground with a great thud.  My body was a mass of raw nerves I could hardly move but I could feel others there.
