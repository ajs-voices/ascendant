# Into The Trenches

And the plans were made and we would move at first light.  Attacking during the day would be unexpected.  We had a few hours to kill.  Tristan, Tony and myself found ourselves in Tony's room, not really knowing where to go from here.

I lay on the bed my knees hanging over the edge, Tony stood staring into the wardrobe closet trying to decide what he wanted to wear.  So girly.

Tristan stood against the door.  "And now it's awkward."

Tony smiled, "Only for you. because you aren't use to her."

"What do you mean?"

"It's not about the sex and all you want is sex right now."  Tony smiled.

"You feel that?"  Tristan blushed.

"He wants you."  I told Tony.

Tony turned around to see Tristan's bright red blush.  Tony walked over to his friend and kissed him.  "I don't have a backdoor."  Tristan nodded, "I do.  And her?"

Tony kissed him again before turning him and pushing him to the bed, "Whatever you want.  You'll get that soon or later."

Tristan looked over and me and pulled my head to his and he kissed me.  He bit my tongue and blood welled into his mouth.  I bit his lip and he gave a small cry of pleasure.  Tony crawled on top of Tristan naked.  

Tristan sat up and kissed Tony then pulled off his shirt.  He crawled over to me and undressed me.  He kissed me and pulled off his pants before sliding inside me.  Tony took advantage of the position and Tristan gave a moan of pure pleasure.  He wanted this badly.  He wanted to be accepted for what he was.  And we did.

We changed position so I was in the middle.  Tristan at my back and Tony to the front.  Tony came and he lay down and watched Tristan and me.  Tristan was straining, "It's okay Trist, finish."  Tony got up on his knees and kissed Tristan over my arched body, "She won't finish that way.  I'll show you how."  Tristan came and He fell to his side taking me with him.  

Tony bit my stomach and I shuttered in pleasure.  Tristan bit me, following Tony's lead.  I whispered, "Harder."  

Tony licked my stomach in complaint to being instructed; He looked over at Tristan along my body, "Make her bleed."  Tony leaned back to watched Tristan bite me.  He bit hard enough to break the skin, he did it again and again until I convulsed under him.  He bit again, I breathed out "Stop."

He bite again and I cried "Stop"

He didn't stop and he bit again.  I felt the beast well out over me, my voice went quiet and unused, I croaked "Stop".

Tony pulled Tristan from me and moved to catch me by my hair.  I wanted blood, I wanted Tristan's blood.  Tony reached around and snapped my neck.

An hour or so later I woke up with a pain in my neck and fully clothed, underwear included.  I felt the bed bounce as Tony sat down, "She's awake."

Tristan leaned over to me, "I'm sorry.  I didn't know."

He looked up at Tony, "Yeah I know, she never says anything she doesn't mean.  I'll remember that.  But what happened?"

Tony explained while I inspected the clothes I was in.  "There is a fine line between blood lust and sexual lust.  She can cross it easily.  You just pushed her over the edge is all.  It's okay we've all done it."

I looked in the mirror and smiled at the outfit.  "Jack in particular."

"She um, with Jack."  Tristan asked.

Tony blushed, "Jack likes pain, and they both get off on aspects of it.  Jack won't stop getting hurt, she won't stop hurting him, and when he is talked into hurting her, he can't stop hurting her because she won't say the stop word."

"Is that his payment?"  Tristan was learning our dynamic quickly.

I shook my head.  "It's a rare treat; we aren't allowed to be alone with each other, ever."

Tristan blushed, "So someone has to watch."

"It's not sex, i's torture. Just because we get off on it doesn't mean we have sex."

Tristan's mouth formed an O.  I turned and kissed his open mouth, he returned the simple message.

I cocked my head at Tony and looked at Tristan.  'You didn't?"

"I did."  Tony smiled.

"He did what?"  Tristan asked.

"Tony mated with you.  He took you for life."

"What's that mean?"

"To you nothing, if you were a female primeval vampire he could get you pregnant."  

Tony laughed, "We'd be famous."

Tristan smiled, "You didn't ask?"

I put my hand on his chest, "He has no control over it."

"Sorry dude, it happens on a biological level.  Sierra's gone you were the next love of my life.  She don't count ‘cause I'm already mated to her."

Tristan was confused again.

"I can mate for life with one primeval woman.  Since she cannot imprint back I was open for Sierra, when Sierra died my connections were opened again and I imprinted on you.  You can't imprint back so I can do it again - on accident if I'm not careful.  So you and her are my only partners from now on."

I looked at Tristan, "But that doesn't mean you can't have another in your life too.  We will be together a long time."

Tristan frowned, "I guess I'm the mate for life type."

I smiled, "You'll get bored.  They always do."

"She's lost many a lesser to a love affair."  Tony was saddened by that fact but he knew it was life.  "And if you really want to be chevalier, you'll be with her for life, there is no turning back."

Tristan nodded.  "But not right now."  We both smiled at him and said, "Not now."

There was a knock at the door and Aurora opened it slowly, "I know you all aren't doing anything but are you decent?"

Tristan called out, "Yes ma'am."

Aurora walked in, "You ready? It's almost time."

We nodded and got up and followed Aurora to the staging ground.  Tristan looked at Tony, "In and out, nothing fancy."

Tony looked at me, "You hear that."

I sighed.  I took Tristan's hand and Tony took Alex and David's, and we stepped into the shadows.

It was dark, everything was dark.  I blinked and still everything was dark.  I heard the first gun go off and I stepped in front of Tristan.  I pulled my sword out and Tristan handed me a second.  "I thought this would be more useful than a dagger."  I took it graciously but didn't look back.  I stepped forward and Tristan followed with his back against mine.  He held a gun and was ready to shoot anyone he saw from behind.  I was impressed with his technique, I hadn't thought about it.  I sliced through the first man with ease.  The second man started to run away when he saw the sword coming for him.   In a whirl of speed we took out the firing line.  It was easy, probably too easy.  

Tristan stayed behind me as we moved through the complex to where my family waited.  I followed the pain where it took me and took out vampires and men when threatened.  The room they were in was guarded by two gnarly vampires.  I didn't have a chance to slice them before Tristan shot them in the head with one shot each.  Silver to the brain, they'd be out for a while.

I kicked in the door and was overwhelmed by the stench of death and decay.  I took a deep breath and walked in to find the five of them hanging with their insides on the outside.  Tristan covered the door.  

I took another deep breath.  Allison was first.  She hung by a thread of life.  My life was the only think keeping her alive.  She whispered, "Just kill me.  Please kill me."  I could barely hear her, her throat was raw.  I kissed her softly on the cheek before chopping off her head.   I stumbled.

Tristan turned to see her head roll.  "What are you doing?"

"What she asked.  They don't want to live."

Tristan came to my side, "But, we came to save them."

"I am."  He hesitated before leaving me alone.

Larry whispered to me.  "He's in a public meeting now.  Kill him."  I nodded.  He kissed me.  "I'm ready."

I snapped his neck and stumbled again.

Tristan helped me to my feet.  Doc nodded and a tear slid down my cheek as I ran my sword through and cut off his head.  I fell.

Tristan watched me as I stood back up.  I beheaded Terry in a quick motion before falling to my knees in pain.

I struggled to get to my feet.  I saw Jack hanging; he had a smile on his face.  "Thank you for coming."  Tears fell from my eyes and I handed the swords to Tristan.  I took my daggers from my sleeves and I crossed my arms and made a huge gapping X in Jacks chest before turning them into their sheaths, I kissed Jacks forehead before ripping his head off with my hands.  I fell to the ground in a mass of tears.

I didn't bother to struggle to my feet I just grabbed Tristan's hand and crawled into the rendezvous point.  Tony didn't ask, he'd felt everything.  Alex and David looked surprised to only see us.  "She never intended to rescue them, did she?"  Tristan asked.  Tony shook his head.  

My the time I saw what I was looking for my strength was back.  "I have a promise to fulfill."

Tristan looked up, "No, you can't.  He's protected."  He grabbed for me, but I stepped into the shadows behind the General who had tortured my friends for the past twelve years.  I grabbed his head and I twisted until it came off in my hands.  I was fast, but the bullet aimed at my head was silver and I collapsed to the ground with his head in my hands.  It was the last thing I remembered before the darkness.
