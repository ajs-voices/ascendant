# The Catacombs

We went into the depths of the Church.   The sanctuary and used portions of the church were just as the entry way had been.  Everything was polished and shined in the dim lights.   I opened the door labeled study.  The elderly priest protested, "Only I may enter here."

I turned back at the man and glared at him.  He hopped and bowed and scraped as if I'd said something sharp.  Ryan bit back a giggle.  Tony put his hand on my shoulder and Ant carefully ushered the man away from us.  He spoke to the priest in hushed tones.

I turned back to the door and it creaked from ill use.  The room behind was dark and dusty.  The dust on the floor showed no recent signs of movement through its four walls.  I smiled.  It was a good thing.  I stepped inside, "Stay here while I find it."

It wasn't that I didn't want them to see, the room was too small for all of us to fit and do what needed to be done.  I held out my hand and felt for my magic.  It was easier than trying to remember exactly what I had done.  As with most of the traps at this point they were veiled and warded.  When I found was I was looking for I was not shocked to see the ancient statue had been broken.  The Roman church had destroyed it, but the piece itself would not budge from the shelf it had stood on.  It was after all part of the wall.  It was the lever that would open the catacombs if the wards were lifted.  There were few people who wanted to move the statue, breaking its ugly figure had been enough.

I removed the veil and the ward.  It was not a simple task, but it was a necessary one.  Tony poked his head in, "Everything alright?"

I nodded.  "It's a complicated ward."

Tony stood in the doorway.  "You make it?"

I shook my head, "No, and Yes.  I helped to create it.  One of Thea's grandmother's helped place it."

I looked at him, he felt concerned in my head, "I can undo it.  It'll just take more time."  He didn't look relieved.  

Ryan pulled on Tony's arm, "Let her work.  She's undone their magic before."  He nodded and they moved into the church, only to be replaced by Ant.

I returned to the complicated spell that I had not fully completed.  It took patience to unravel what I had done, so that the entire thing would fold on itself, hopefully without a bang.

I could feel Ant's eyes on me he was watching what I was doing with learning eyes.  I turned and smiled at him.  He grinned back.  "I see the end.  Almost done."

I nodded, "Good.  Care to finish?"

He looked at me with a childhood glee I had not seen in many years on my son's face.  He nodded emphatically and moved around me to finish the work.  I put a shield around both of us while he worked, just in case of a bang.  I called out to the others.  "You might want to be away from this area a bit more, just in case."

The priest questioned me as he poked his head into the room.  "In case..."  And the ward dropped with a large pop.  I shook my head from the pressure of the sound.  It had not been loud, but it released enough pressure to knock the man back who had been standing in the door way.

"In case of that or worse."  I pulled the broken statue and bookshelf swung open.  Ant and I had to step out of the room for it to finish its arc.

The three other men were setting up camp to watch the door as we went in.  "You can't stay here.  We'll be separated; we aren't coming back this way.  You either come all the way with us, or you go find the others."

They stared back at me, only one had the courage to tell me, "Our orders were to watch your back."

I smiled, "Then you need to stay with us.  This will not be a problem."

"We have our orders, my may be Eldest, but we were ordered by the Vicar to stand outside and guard you."

I sighed, "Fine, you can wait here until we come back."

"And that will be when?"  He asked.

I stepped through the doorway, "Never."

Ryan and Ant laughed, Tony sighed, "Do what you want men, but the Vicar does not know what she plans to do to protect the relics.  This building may not stand when she is done."  And he followed us through.

At this point I didn't care if they followed or not.  They could stay the cowards that they were.  But I heard them enter the darkness and one of them pulled the door closed behind him.  I heard one mumbled to another, "It'll be safer with her than without her."  I was glad to see they'd not been fools or cowards.

The passage was dark, and damp unlike the room we had just been in.  Our footsteps echoed down the long passages.   At first the passage was man made, each brick laid precisely.  You could see the varying techniques as things got older.  Eventually the tile ran out and the ground and the walls were natural rock.  You could hear a faint drip of water off in the distant cave.  I could feel everyone's tension, everyone was wary of what was around the next bend.  

We walked for nearly an hour before we came to our first ward.  Ant easily brought the ward down.  He smiled happily as he'd stepped past.  He was a fast learner, but he was also only dealing with vampire magic this far down.  Ant felt for the next ward in front of him, "Don't take it down."  I cautioned him.  He nodded as he felt it a few yards down the length of the passage. He stopped in front of it and waited for me.

I pointed to an alcove, "Everyone over there, move along the wall and wait over there."  I pointed to the other side of the passage.  "This ward will not come down.  It needs to remain intact."

They all skirted the edge like I instructed and waited.  When they were all clear I pulled my shields around me and I stepped through the ward.  Fire enshrouded me as I walked through the ward.  I could feel the magic pulsing against my shields.  It was almost too powerful, and then it was done as I crossed the invisible line.  I reached around the veil and stepped into it.  I would have disappeared from my comrade's view.  There were many things in the tiny alcove.  Most of which were not helpful.  I grabbed the leather straps jumbled in a pile on one shelf, the handful of metallic rods from another and placed them in my pockets.  I scanned the bindings of the leather bound tomes searching for one book in particular.  When I found it I pulled the backpack off my back and placed it carefully inside, then shut it quickly.  I grabbed the two medallions on the bottom shelf and a few stones that looked to be nothing.  I put them in my pockets.   

I stepped out of the veil and what I saw was not what I was expecting.

My men were facing off against Nate and his men.  Nate glared at me.  I could feel his power beneath his skin.  I reached in my pocket and flung one of the medallions at Ryan.  He caught it with a smile.  He knew what it was he'd helped me make it.  Nate's people were standing in the perfect spot.  I smiled at Nate.

"Well, well, look what we have here, a doggy in the middle."

"Ant, do you see it?"  I asked hoping he'd know what I meant.  

He laughed, "Yeah. But I don't know what to do."

I smiled.  "You fire then I'll do it."

He smiled.  "I can handle that."

I reached up my hands to the ceiling and sent my power flying to the ceiling above.  Ant flung his hands in front of him and flames shot down the hallway.  Nate had been expecting something and he laughed as the flames went around him.  His people were not so lucky they started to scream in pain and running in the opposite direction.   I pulled my hands down pulling the magical wedges in the roof I had placed. I pulled with all my strength and the ceiling crumbled to the floor in a loud crash behind Nate.  He turned to see that his people were either on fire or crushed.

Nate had a temper much like his powers he rushed me in anger, right into the ward.  He hadn't thought to keep his shields up once Ant had finished his flame throw.  His body burnt mere feet in front of me.  I chocked back the nausea as I brought my shields back around me and stepped towards my people.    We nearly ran to the bend to escape the flaming screams and the sizzling of flesh and bone.

But we had to stop, the rest must be collapsed.  Ant smiled at me and reached to the ceiling.  Tony reached as well, he was not as strong in elements but he could do it.  I reached with them and the three of us brought down the roof systematically burying the artifacts beneath their rubble.  The cavern started to crumble in front of us. 

We ran down the corridor until we found our first route to the east.  We would have to keep going east to get to the compound.  The cave in had subsided and the remaining corridors should be sound, we only hoped we could find our way to the compound with the damage from the bombings and what we had just done.  We could only hope to find a way through.
