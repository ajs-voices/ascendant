#Forging On

By the time Tony and I had made it to the warehouse we called home, Ant and Ryan were already heating the forge.  That would take the longest time, but they knew what they were doing.

People came out of the wood work.  Dom, Rick and Taylor came bearing crystals.  Taylor spoke for them, "We want one too.  We'll give up our alottment of cyrstals to to do it with."

I smiled, "No need to give them up.  But I will make some for your most skilled hunters.  Ya'll are going to go back to killing us, and I don't want you killing us with our own magic."

Dom and Rick frowned but nodded.  "Then only the three of us and Annabeth."

I looked confused, "That's all you consider the best."

The boys all looked sheepish.  I turned to Ant and Ryan, "What have ya'll been plotting?"

Tony stepped in between them.  "While you were busy, we were talking."  He paused as if he were trying to find the right words.  He took a step back, "Ryan and I can't kill you with out killing our selves.  Our own self preservation could kick in.  Ant is your son, he says he could.  We all say we can, but can we really in the end kill you?"

I understood, "So you want to train hunters to kill me.  Humans are just going to die, and then we'll have to start all over again."

Taylor shook his head, "We'd agree to be taken as LESSER Chevalier.  Live forever tied to you, be trained by you to become the best damned hunters in the world, and if we have to kill you.  It's a goal we all wish for.  Why wouldn't we take them up on the offer."

Dom guffawed.  "She won't accept it.  Why would anyone want to train someone to kill themselves?  That's why she trained those closest to her."

"If that's what you all want to do, I'm game."

Dom's jaw dropped.  Apparently he really thought I was that person.  

I slit my wrist and Annabeth was the first, I hadn't seen her hiding behind the men when she came in.  She smiled up at me brightly.  I took her wrist and bit softly and she tentatively drank my blood.  

_Your blood to my heart.
My blood to to your heart.
Together to bind us._

I felt Annabeth in my mind and she stared up at me with awe and glee.  She was excited to find out my weaknesses.  When the others joined her only Taylor was reserved in his eagerness.   Dom and Rick were nearly falling over with glee.  I had to block the three of them before they overwhelmed me with the eagerness to kill me.

Tony laughed.  I looked at him, Annabeth asked, "What's so funny?"

"You all want to kill her so bad, you are giddy with joy.  Not only does she feel it radiating from you,"  tony gestured to the air around him, "it's all in your mind, the only thing on your mind coming through.  She just blocked ya'll out so she could function."

Ryan smiled, "We'll teach you how to control your feelings so the connection is always open.  But we have work to do."

The rest of the day we spent forging coins for various vampires and humans.  Tony was first in line.  He smiled back at me as we cemented the coins to his magic.  He just banished himself from his own clan.  He really did love me, my heart swooned and skipped a beat.  Tony laughed at me with fondness and I punched him in the arm.  He laughed harder.  It felt wonderful to have him back.  I didn't quite know what to do with myself.

Jesse was next in line.  He only wanted one and he looked sad.  I pulled him down and laid a passionate kiss on his lips.  He licked his lips when he stood up and glanced over at his brother.  Tony nodded his acceptance.  Jesse didn't know what to do.   I pushed him out of line.  "You are done!"  He laughed and went on his way to play with his new toy.

Dom, Rick, Taylor and Annabeth were next in line and theres were a little harder to do with the gem but it worked in the end.  Ant, Tony and Ryan helped them pick up their new skills.  

Throughout the day, their little class grew in numbers as we exhausted all the metal that Davyn had brought out of his mines for us.  There were only a few unused pieces left when Davyn came to the forge.  

"Do you want one?"

Davyn nodded, "If there are any left."

I nodded and forged one last piece before I fell to the ground exhausted from all the magic work I had done the past hours.

Davyn caught me before I hit the ground.  He handed me to Tony who promptly offered me his wrist.  I took enough so I could finish Davyn's Caestus.  And then leaned into Tony and he easily lifted me into his arms and carried me away.  I sank into him.  I felt his heart beat, his power and fell asleep in his arms.

We slept on our plans and the scouts would report to us before dawn.  Our plan was to begin as the sun rose above the horizon and free our nation and the world from the vampire reign that plagued it now, all because I did not kill Brandon and Valence nearly two decades ago.
