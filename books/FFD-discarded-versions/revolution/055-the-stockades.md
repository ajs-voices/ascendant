# The Stockades

When we went in to kill Valence, Tony had ordered the surrender and the capture of all enemies who had not turned their weapons on me.  Most of those who had surrendered were vampires, they knew much more about me than their human counterparts.  Though we did have a few smart humans, or they had not been in the room I had proclaimed our victory in.  When the enemy guns turned on me he burnt them all alive.  I can still hear their screams and smelt their burning flesh.  The thought of it makes my stomach curl up into a tight ball. 

We held our enemies in what the Clan calls the stockades.  Basically it's a deep dark and damp cave that they have guards on twenty four hours a day seven days a week.  The entrance to the Stockades is barred with necromancy and elemental magic.  Nothing can get in and no one goes in without the circle's consent.  And today, I have that consent.  

It is far easier to make the vampires cow to us, than it is to keep them locked up and withering.  We have tried on prior occasions to coerce them to our side, but most are loyal to their cause.   Today I want to try.  I am Il Cane.  I am the hand of the council.  It means something to them, or they would not have surrendered to us.  It is good to be feared, but respect carries far more weight.

Tony insisted on coming with me, and where Tony went, so did Ryan and Ant.  We were the four musketeers, it was meant as a derogatory notion from members of the Clan.  They believed us weak, and that we were to not be trusted.  But the circle of elders trusted us.  We were outsiders to those who thought that we would never be good enough, not even if we won this war by ourselves.  Which we couldn't do and we know it.  We need allies and we sought them out like a horse to water.

The men guarding the cave bowed at the sight of me.  Being Eldest did have some perks, even though I still would have gotten the same bow.  Even primeval vampires feared Il Cane.

Tony and I dropped the barrier and the four of us stepped inside before the guards raised the magic to keep everyone in.  We would be unable to remove it from the inside.  Inside a magic kept all vampire powers at bay.  It was disconcerting to feel powerless.  I put my hand on my sword for comfort.  Ryan and Ant did the same.  Tony on the other hand grabbed my free hand.  We all had our own comforts.  We walked into the shadowed depths of the cave.

As our eyes adjusted to the darkness we saw pale and shriveling vampires hiding in the darkness.  They all watched as we passed them.  I could feel their eyes on my back as we walked deeper into the stockades.  We walked into the cavern and I felt the bodies behind us press in.  To them at this instance we were food.  The ring of steel echoed in the chamber as the four of us drew our swords.  The sound alone pushed the vampires back.  If there had been any humans in the captured men they were no more.  They'd long since been feed upon and discarded.  Vampires don't feed on vampires.  Dead is dead and vampires cannot feed on the dead.  But we were not dead, we all lived, our hearts beat and our pulses drove the captured enemies crazy. 

Tony spoke in his largest voice he could muster with out magic, his voice carried to the back of the cavern easily, "We come to broker peace."

A low rumble started to rise among the vampires.  But Tony continued, "We offer you your freedom to feed, if you join us.  Swear your fealty to Il Cane and we will let you feed in small droves.  Supervised of course, until you remember what you are and the covenant you broke when signing on with Brandon Holt and Valence Dilanti."

The rumble grew louder.  A voice in the back spoke in a low voice, as if it was painful to speak, "We do not follow the bitch and her human companions.  She is the blight of our existence.  You come to your deaths."

A mass of bodies launched at us. We all moved quickly into a protective formation our back to each other.  We were a well-oiled machine.  We'd trained together, we'd fought together.  We knew how the others reacted.  At least three of us did.  Tony was at a disadvantage, but he was my Chevalier.  He could feel me, he knew me and he trusted me.  He trusted Ryan and Ant we were all a well-oiled machine despite that advantage.

The mass of bodies fell at our feet as we sliced through their bodies with ease.  I felt a sharp pain in my arm as one of them sank their fangs into my flesh. Ryan brought down his sword and the top of the vampires head was sliced in half.  His body clung to my arm.  I shook him off but his fangs were anchored in deeply.  I chopped of the corpses head at the neck.  It still clung to my arm, but a swift swing at another coming vampire and the head flew into the darkness.

We fought, our lives depended on it.  These men had nothing left to live for.  It was an impossible battle for us all.  They thought they were at the advantage.  They had no way out except through us.  But we had no way out either.  They would not drop the barrier for us if we'd made a run for it.  We fought to the death.  The bodies were piling up at our feet, but we were getting tired and there were still more of them coming.  We were injured and tired, I took a deep breath and wished for the courage to do what I was about to do.  I sheathed my swords and I grabbed Tony at my left and Ryan at my right.  I yelled, "Ant."  He sheathed his sword and grabbed Tony and Ryan on the other side. We held their bodies leaving their arms free to fight.  Ant shielded us while I ignited the bodied in front of us.  The fire raged but it did not come in towards us.  The few brave vampires dove through the flames.  They screamed in pain as Tony or Ryan cut them down.  As the fuel in front of us died down the fire died with them.  We could not see anything, but neither could they.  We knew there were more of them but none attacked.  

A woman called out from the shadows, "We yield.  There are only women and children left.  We yield."  

We stood and waited for our eyes to adjust, our ears were strained as we listened for any form of advancement, but nothing came, the woman told the truth.

When I let go of Tony and Ryan the women and the children crawled to us.  "We swear to abide by the covenant or Il Cane will hunt us down and kill us dead."  A chorus of voices followed.  I saw the glow of magic around each woman and child.  I had never seen such a thing I stared in amazement.

Ant said something I didn't hear.  Tony tapped me on the shoulder.  "What's wrong?"

"Their oaths are real."

Tony kissed my cheek, "You are Eldest, this is a place of magic you see the magic as is your right.  Their oaths are binding, and if they break their oath, they will die by that magic."

Tony led me out of the cave, the women and children following us.  Ant and Ryan were bringing up the rear.  We reached the entrance and night had fallen, we'd been in the stockades for nearly eight hours fighting for our lives.  The moonlight showed our bodies splattered with blood and I realized my magic had worked inside the caves.  I looked back and wondered what had happened.  Tony looked at me, "What's wrong?"

"My magic worked.  Ant's worked."  

Ant smiled, "No only yours did.  I pulled from you to shield us."

"Why did mine work?"

Tony laughed, "You are Eldest you command the Clan's magic."

I sighed. I had much to learn still it seemed.  The guards stared at us as we stood behind the barrier covered in drying and dried blood.  "The remaining vampires have sworn their loyalty to the covenant."

The guards dropped the barrier and we walked out.  I felt the fresh air cooling my skin. I had not realized it was so hot inside those caves.  I looked up at the night sky and closed my eyes.  Fresh air had never felt so good.

The women and children were huddled into a mass of weeping bodies.  They were glad to be out of the darkness.  I looked at Tony, "What happens to them now?"

"The circle has provided some temporary camps for them.  We hoped you could talk some sense into them.  It's too bad that most of the fighters died at our hands."  Tony wiped his sword on the dew covered grass.  It only smeared the blood.  He sighed.  "Let's go clean up."
