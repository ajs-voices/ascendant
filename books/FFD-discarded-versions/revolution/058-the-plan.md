# The Plan

Apologize were never very easy to accept but there really was more important things to do than sit around a mope about.  I pulled myself out of the comfortable bed.  It was harder than it looked, the feather mattress was a bit too squishy for my tastes, but it would do in a pinch.  We definitely had better things to do than sit around doing nothing.  I sat on the edge of the bed, "We have a few things to discuss and to take care of."

Donatello laughed, "And right back to business.  I'll gather the circle and we can start when you are ready."

I nodded, "I need Ant and Ryan included as well as anyone who was at the compound outside Dangdburgh, we need details we probably don't have right now."

Donatello nodded and looked at Tony, "You know that better than I do.  One hour?"  Tony nodded and Donatello left us alone.

Tony turned to me, "I guess I should go too, find those bodies you need."  He smiled as he grabbed my hands and pulled me to my feet.  "Eat real food and some blood and then you can leave the house.  Meelah will not let you leave if you don't abide by her rules."

I smiled and nodded, "If you insist."  Tony kissed me softly then left to go hunt down anyone he could that knew anything about the compound he had called home for many years.  We needed a layout; we needed obstacles that may be present.  We needed more than we had if we were going to navigate through the catacombs and retrieve the lost artifacts.  I wasn't looking forward to entering the Church of the Damned, but it had to be done.  I only hoped that the way would be clear to the compound.

I got up from the bed and walked into the other room to find Meelah had set a table full of food.  "Eat." she commanded me.

I nodded.  "Yes, ma'am."  I sat down at the table and stared at the offerings.  I had no idea where to start.  Morgan and Carissa helped me.  Carrissa took a big scoop of something and plopped it on the plate in front of me.  Morgan poured a sauce over the top of it.  Carissa smiled, "Mashed potatoes and gravy."  

Morgan dropped a piece of meat on my plate.  I frowned at her, I knew what that was.  "No.  I won't eat that."  

She looked up at me, "But Nana's roast is good."

I smiled, "I don't eat meat, any meat."

Carissa smiled, "Just try it."

I shook my head.  "No."

Meelah looked at me, "Something wrong with my cooking?"

I smiled, "No ma'am, I have not eaten meat since I was 5 years old."

Meelah's mouth formed a surprised O as she realized why.  "I will remember that child."  She took Morgan by the hand, "Your Mommy is a vegetarian she doesn't eat meat."

Morgan nodded and took the roast from my plate and stuffed it in her mouth.  I smiled at her.  "Thank you."

Carissa and Morgan heaped vegetables and fruit on to my plate, there was little room for anything else.  Meelah smiled, "I'll insure there is other protein next time."

I nodded, "Thank you."

I tried everything the girls had offered me.  I had carrots and peas, they were all too mushy for my taste, but I ate them.  I did like the mashed potatoes, though I think the gravy was a meat base and I could feel my stomach churning from the flavor.  I ate everything they provided me.  Meelah was satisfied, "And a bit to wash it down with?"

"Tony won't let me out without it, so yes."  

Meelah smiled broadly.  "Sam is waiting for you outside."

I picked up the girls and sat them in my lap.  "Thank you.  Now you be good for Meelah, And Morgan, no more playing with fire."

She looked at me ashamed, "How did you know it was me?"

I smiled, "I just know.  No more elemental from anyone but me, understand?"  I looked to Meelah, "Can you insure that the teachers know that?"

Meelah nodded.  "I can child.  She will not touch it again.  I think she's a bit afraid to."

"We'll fix that but not right now."  I set the girls down with a big hug.  "I have to go get some things back safely before the enemy finds them."

Sam was waiting outside; he greeted me with a bright smile.  "Still hungry?"

I laughed, "Not really, but if I don't they'll know and I'll be in trouble."

He grinned and offered his wrist.  I bit into his wrist and drank the coppery liquid.  It tasted far more wonderful than I'd remembered.  I forced myself to stop.  Sam laughed, "You need more after eating.  You are one weird vampire Cari.  I'm not sure any one person can satisfy your hunger."  

I smiled, "You'll just have to do.  We have things to do."  

He nodded, "Tony told me to get one of the other vampires to escort me and Andrew to some of the other conclaves and clans out there to see if we can get you the details you want without raising too much suspicion.  That cool?"

"If that's what he wants you to do."  

"I'm yours not his.  I had to ask."

I laughed, "For future reference, if Tony, Ant or Ryan ask you to do something you can assume I agreed.  I won't be mad at you for doing what they ask. " I smiled evilly, "I might take it out of their hide, but not yours."

He grinned, "Okay.  I'll keep that in mind and let the others know.  See ya Cari."

I watched Sam leave before he disappeared down the hill.  I turned to head towards the meeting room.  I knew what we needed to do, but I didn't know how dangerous it was going to be.  Getting into the Church of the Damned was going to be dangerous enough as it was.  I just hoped we could get in.

In the meeting room most of the circle stood around a large piece of paper.  Tony and Ant looked up at me.  "We got a basic structure down, you need more?"

"Not right now, we'll see what else we need."

Ant turned the paper to face me, "This is what we remember before all the destruction.  What's still there we don't know."

I nodded, "Yeah I know.  Where were you keeping the artifacts you took from my vaults?"

Tony marked a red X in a room that was not going to be easy to reach.  

"North is at the top?"

Ant and Tony looked at each other Tony turned the map in one direction and put a N at the top.  "That's North I think."

I smiled, "It's important to know the direction."

He nodded, "I'm pretty sure it is."

I asked the room in general, "Do we have a map of Dangdburgh?"

Tony asked, "Yeah, why?"

"Need that too."

He nodded, "Yeah I got that why?"

"Cause we are going back there."

Ant interrupted, "Cari, that's dangerous to do.  Brandon's going to have a lot of his people there waiting for us to show up again."

I nodded, "I know.  But there are only three other ways into those catacombs I know of - one at Frozen, one at my estate, and one at the Church of the Damned."

Ant and Tony frowned.  Tony was the first to speak though, "There is no Church of the Damned."

I smiled, "Not on the map officially.  It's called Dangdburgh's Roman Catholic Church."

"Why did you call it the Church of the Damned then?"

"Because that's what it is underneath, once before Dangdburgh was populated with more humans, a cult of human's worshiped vampires there.  The Roman Catholic's claimed it and supposedly cleansed it.  But the secrets still lie under it.  We have to get in and it is the easiest way to do so.  I doubt Brandon has anyone waiting there for us."

Donatello interceded, "But no vampire can enter sacred ground."

I smiled, "I can.  You have to trust me.  I can get us in."
