# Reunions

My dreams were quiet.  But I woke to a ravenous hunger in human arms.  I could feel his heart beat beneath my head; I could feel the pulse in his wrists.  He let go of me, but not too quickly.   He whispered, "Its okay."  He offered me his wrist.

I turned to see who had been holding me.  I was surprised to see Tristan he was fragile I didn't want to hurt him. 

I was about to stop when someone stepped out of the shadows and fell over us, halting my feeding, a young man who was the spitting image of Francesco.

The man's grin grew wider and I smiled across at him, "You look like your grandfather."

He smiled and got up.  "I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to fall on you."  He looked over at Tristan and frowned, "Dad's in a foul mood.  I thought you were coming after some secret weapon?"

I started to get up and Henry offered me his hand.  I took it, I didn't need it but he was being polite.  I looked down at Tristan and offered him my hand, "A secret weapon?"

Tristan smiled at me sheepishly and took my hand to help him stand.  "Yeah, we did.  He's upset that we found the secret weapon."

"Seriously, you are going to keep talking like I don't exist?"    I didn't liked being talked about like an object much less like I wasn't there.

Henry looked at me confused.  He looked so much like his father it nearly broke my heart.  Tristan laughed, "Henry, meet Cari..."

Tristan didn't have a chance to finish his sentence before Henry landed a right hook in my face.  "I was ten when my Dad was forced to kill my mom and sister.  You could have stopped it."  Tristan tried to stop him but Henry was too strong and too fast.  I let the lad beat on me.  I blocked my face for any other incoming blows.  Henry began to tire I could feel it in his bows.  But out of the shadows a pair of vampires stepped into view.  

It felt like they were larger than life, towering above us all, but that was not the case.  I recognized them at a glance and their magic ceased to work on me, Francesco and his wife Marie when together could be pull off the illusion they had just done.  Marie hadn't stayed in the shadows.  She glanced at her grandson hitting me and walked away.  Francesco put a hand on the boy's shoulder and pulled him back.  I only relaxed my guard slightly.

"Henry, go find your grandmother." He listened without hesitation.

Tristan was nursing a scuffed elbow.  He'd fallen against the rock door frame.

I looked up at Francesco, "It seems the whole family hates me."  I sighed and sank back to the ground.  I could leave, it was well past sunset, but this place just felt safer.  I curled back up and rested my forehead on my knees.

"No, child, only they do.  Marie and I believe you did the right thing.  You didn't know what was going to happen.  We couldn't do anything to save you.  We tried.  And they don't hate you, they just need someone to blame."  Francesco always sounded so wise.

"When we found Henry was gone, we followed him."

I looked up.  "I need to return this spot back to its safety.  Too many people are coming here."  I knew someone bad would be next.  I stooped up.  "If you are brining others Thea can tell you where a clearing is that will work for your purposes, but this needs to be sealed again.  Do not come again here."

Tristan clarified.  "She means to this specific spot.  It's a weakness right now.  When she and Tony came in they took the barrier down or we'd have lost them both."

Francesco smiled and stepped out of the circle.  I placed my base ward; it would keep anyone in or out until Thea could raise the barrier again.  I looked at the place between worlds and wished I could go back into the safety of the shadows.  I sighed and then my anger rose inside me.  I was angry at myself.  I hated being weak.  I hated feeling like this.  

Marie and Henry came out of the hut I had been taken to the prior day.  Marie smiled at me, "We will bring the rest of your friends here while you gain your feet again.  Thea told us where to go.  She said she'd be out to raise the barrier soon.  She also told me you needed to eat again."

I nodded.  

I left the confines of the town and back into the woods.  It was more comforting than the people around me.  I found myself back at the babbling creek.  I fell to my knees and felt tears falling from my eyes. I cried for a long time.

Hours must have passed before I felt someone coming.  I didn't feel like straightening myself.  They could just leave me be, but the crying had faded.

As soon as he was within range the wind changed I caught the safe scent of Tony wafting my direction.  My heart sank.  I didn't want to fight again.

He stood behind me and I tried to ignore him.  We listened to the babbling creek in silence.

Tony was the first to break the silence.  "I knew I'd find you here.  I'm sorry about Henry.  He didn't hurt you did he?"

"He's just coming into his powers, he did fine, but I'm okay."  I tried hard not to sound like I had been crying.

"I forget you raised one of us.  Ant must have been a handful."  

I sat up and turned around and sat on the damp sand.  I didn't look up at Tony I just shrugged.  I had nothing to compare it too.  

"Aurora wants to see you."  I looked up at him; I knew there was a ‘but' coming.  "But she wants to tell the full story to everyone.  My father agrees upon his secret, but we have to agree to share ours as well."  He looked neither happy nor sad about the situation.  I guess there wasn't much they could do about it now anyway.  

I held up my hand to Tony.  "Full disclosure is not a bad thing."

Tony took my hand and helped me up.  He pulled me in close and whispered.  "I'm sorry.  I don't like fighting with you like this."  I stepped back so I could see his face, he was smiling.

"I'm sorry too.  Sorry for everything that's happened."  He wrapped my arms around his body and put my head against his chest.  I felt more at peace than I had in a very long time.  He held me tight before he lifted my chin to kiss me.  It was a tentative kiss at first, and then the passion grew.  I melted into his arms things were going places we hadn't been in centuries.

But I got the nagging call from the council.  I pulled away from Tony, "Aurora's calling."  

Tony mumbled, "She can wait" as he kissed me deeper.

I wanted to do as he said, but she'd been nagging at me for the past ten minutes.    I pulled away breathless, I tried to talk but Tony tried to kiss me again, all I could get out was "ten minutes, ruins the mood."

Tony pulled away with a frown but there was a smile in his eyes.  "If we must."  He licked his lips and I wanted to kiss him, instead I took his hand and started walking back to town.

Halfway there we met Ant, he exclaimed, "Thank God!  I didn't want to have to stop you two now that you stopped fighting."  Tony punched Ant in the shoulder.  "Ow."  He smiled.  Then Ant looked at me with a grin.  He grabbed me and wrapped his arms around me and spun me around in a great big bear hug.  "I missed you."

I laughed; he was still very much a child when it came to me.  He put me down.  "Nicola can't wait to see you either."

Ant threw his arm around my shoulder and Tony and I walked hand in hand back into the small town that had half the council waited.  I wondered which half.
