# The Fire

As we were walking back to the village we started to hear shouting, and in the distance smoke rose above the village.  It was another attack, that was my first thought.  We ran in the direction of the village.  But as we got closer we saw that a building was on fire.  Men and women had formed a line and were making an assembly line of water to put out the fire.  It seemed an odd thing to be doing, why someone wasn't using their elemental powers to extinguish the flames was rather odd to me.  Surely someone was strong enough to pull the water from the air.

A young man darted through the crowd wrangling children up.  Tony looked slightly panicked, where were the girls?  I felt for them, and found them but it was not a good place.  I grabbed the young man who was gathering children.  "How many are inside?"

He frowned as he looked up at me, "I don't know."  He looked down, "But I can't find Carissa or Morgan."

I nodded and I looked at the flames.  They were alive, I could feel them panicking.  Tony was walking the length of the building trying to find a place to get by the flames.  There was little time the girls were starting to lose consciousness, I could feel them slipping from me.  I pulled my magic around me and I walked through the flames.  The girls and three other children were huddled in a corner.  There were fallen beams and more fire than I cared for in between us.  The children stared back at me with hope.  I had no other choice, I walked through the flames.  I was careful not to disturb anything, the building was about to crumble.  I felt the heat from the flames felt like it was burning my skin, but my magic protected me.  

I was finally close enough to the children, I grabbed the first child and extended my magic to her, she grabbed Carissa and the chain continued, until all five children were under my protection.  I put the girls hand on the back of my shirt, "Do not let go, for anything.  Everyone hold on."  

The children need a quick way out.  I saw no way to get them out quickly.  I'd have to make my own way.  And pray we were quick enough to get out.  I drew my swords and I focused what magic I could at the wall in front of us.  Morgan lent me her magic and I hardened my blades with earth.  I smashed through the wall and I heard the timbers creak and caught the first in time for the children to scramble past me.  They were out and I held a flaming timber in my hands above my head.  I started to feel the weight grow and the mass of flames engulfing everything above me.  

I wasn't sure what to do next but I had to do something.  I found Tony standing in front of me he grabbed my shirt, "Drop it."  I did as he said and he pulled me from underneath the falling roof before I was crushed underneath it.  Vampire strength and speed was a wonderful thing when it was needed.  

I collapsed on the ground and the girls ran to me and wrapped their arms around me.  Tony knelt in front of us and patted the girls back.  Leyla and Lee came crying into our mass they had been worried about their sisters.

I started to catch glimpses of the conversations behind me.  "She's afraid of nothing."  "Wow. She's good."  "She's stupid, that was stupid."  And every variation of things you could imagine people would say for what I had just done.  I had been stupid, I was afraid but I had no other choice.  

A little boy who I had saved came over to me and hugged me tightly, "Thank you.  You were brave.  I was so scared."

I looked at the little boy, "So was I?"

He laughed like I was lying.  Tony patted the boys back, "She was probably more afraid than you were."  Tony looked at me, "What do you fear most?"

I put my head down, I wasn't embarrassed but it could be used against me in the future, "Fire."

The little boy looked at me, "And you still went in?"

I smiled, "Should I have let you die even though I knew I could save you because I was afraid?"

He thought about it for a minute.  "I'm glad you came for us even though you were afraid."

I smiled at the little boy.  He smiled back, "How come you didn't look afraid?  I know I was."

"The first thing I learned about my powers was how to control my fear, so it could not control me."

"How did you do that?"  He asked curiously.

"You wouldn't like the answer."

"Please tell me.  Tell us."

I sighed, "My sire put me in a coffin and made me believe the coffin was on fire.  And when I'd conquered that fear and knew it was just illusion, he put me in a real burning coffin."

He looked at me horrified, "Why would your father do that?"

"He wasn't my father he was one of my sires.  And he did it to train me, so I could be the best Enforcer I could be, so that no vampire with the power to induce fears could ever hurt me."  It was the harsh truth, one that I had accepted long before I had even become a vampire.  It was the one thing I expected of anyone teaching, to hold no bars to make you the best you can be.  I did not intend to torture my children, I hadn't with Ant, but I would make it possible for them to succeed through the worst of times.

He stared at me.  "You really are The Hound of Death then?"

I nodded, "Yes."

He stared at me longer. I could see him weighing his options in his mind.  Even among the primeval vampire clans I was to be feared.  I was unstoppable by most of their standards.  It is the one reason I trained Ryan and Ant so hard to kill me if the need arose.  Hopefully it never did, but one can never be too safe.  The boy smiled at me, he had come to his decision, "I still want to be just like you."

I smiled, "Hopefully not just like me, be yourself and you will be fine."

He grinned at me and ran off to find his parents.

Donatello was standing above me. I hadn't noticed him with my attention on the boy.  "So Sal locked you in a coffin to teach you to control your fear of fire?"

I nodded.  He smiled, "And you just walked into that real blaze like it was nothing."

I shrugged, "It wasn't nothing.  It was hard, but I had no other option."

He smiled, "If your children had not been in there would you still have gone."

I looked up at him, "Of course.  I would not let another die if I could stop it."

"But you make a living killing people."

I stood up, "I make a living taking care of the vampire nation.  I do as I'm told and I do what is right no matter the cost.  It is my honor, my duty and my obligation."

"And yet you didn't kill Brandon and Valence when you had the chance."  Donatello seemed slightly angry at the past.

I sighed, "I didn't know why they wanted me to kill them. I don't think the council even knew what they were really after.  But I didn't kill them because I thought it was right.  I saved my family.  I saved Tony from dying.  I saved Mia and Ryan from dying.  When honor, duty and obligations from two separate entities clash, what do you do?  You make a decision, you stand by the decision and you do not look back.  I made my decision.  It may not have been the right one for now, but it was the right one then.  I am correcting the problem that is now.  I am here.  I'm doing something about it.  So unless you know something else that I should be doing get off your high horse and let me do it."  I stalked away.  I took a deep breath as I walked into the forest.  No one followed. I could feel their eyes on my back.  I was tired of being blamed for this, it was not my fault.
