# Death Do Us Part

Ryan put his hand around my waist.  "Ant wants to talk to you."  We walked to where Ant was standing.

He didn't smile, it was serious.  "You need Ryan."

"He's going with me."

Ant shook his head, "No, you NEED Ryan."  Ant handed me a book written in a language that few could read.  I read the passage he was pointing and looked up at him in shock.  

"Seriously?"

Ryan and Ant both nodded and in unison said, "Yes."

Ant continued, "It's great having my best friend in my head, but you need him.  You need that.  I can pass you the bond forever.  No new deaths needed."

I looked at Ryan and he smiled at me, "I'm the one who suggested it." He said to me to assure me.  "I miss you, and while it's great and calm with Ant it's harder for me."

"If it's what you both want."  They nodded.

The process wasn't hard.  A new blood bond, Ryan and I cut our hands and we let our blood mingle together as we grasped hands.  And put his hand first on Ryan and then on me and I felt a jolt and then Ryan was clearly in my head.  I hadn't even heard Ant whispering the spell to make it happen.  Ant smiled at me, "Mother, this is all I can do to help you in this battle.  I can't defend as well as you.  I'm sorry."

I hugged Ant, "I wasn't going to ask you to come.  I don't want to lose you."

Davyn interrupted us, "It's time, everyone's ready to go."

And we went through the Shadows to Evangeline's compound.

As soon as we stepped through it was utter chaos.  Evangeline had been ready for us.  Guns were going off in all directions, bodies fell on both sides.  I saw Evangeline behind the mass of her protectors.  She looked frustrated and I smiled at her.  She saw me and ran the other direction.  It was times like these I wished I'd had more of a necromancer calling or even domination.  But I had one thing that they couldn't fight.  I projected fear in front of me.  I made everyone cower before me as I waded through the bodies, both live and dead.  

Taylor and the others followed behind me knocking out any human they encounter that was still alive, and killing any vampire they found.  I wondered in one moment how they could tell the difference.  But that was a question for another time.  I knew Evangeline's magic.  I could follow her to the ends of the earth and she knew it.  She was trapped her in her compound and I knew that we'd have more trouble coming soon.

From the shadows behind us, a wave of vampires waded into my men.  Evangeline had called for help.  As I turned I saw the man responsible for bringing them through.  Charles had once been adviser to Francesco, but now he was on the other side.  He threw fire at my men.  I extended my shields as best as I could, but I wasn't able to save most of them from the fire that soon engulfed them.

I fought back the nausea caused by the burning flesh.  I moved forward with a small contingent of men.  We moved quickly with a pack of vampires on our tails.  Thankfully they were lesser vampires and fell easily with the silver the men behind me carried.  But their ammo was limited and I knew we had to do something else.  I busted down a door and lead the men inside.  They quickly made barricades while I stood in the door way.  Once they were settled I walked back into the hallway with shadow swords in hand.  I cut a swath through the vampires, the remainder flooded into the room I had left.  All I could hear was a hail of bullets flying from the room.  My goal was Charles.

He saw me coming and he smiled at me.  He thought he could take me on.  I didn't give him the satisfaction as I thought of him on fire and he screamed.  I watched as he ran the other direction.  The flames would burn him alive no matter where he went.  They would not take down the compound, or leave if he went through the shadows.  Once the flames started they only stopped when their job was done.  It was not a fair fight, but I didn't care.  

The remaining vampires stared at me and laid down their weapons and knelt on the floor.  But they were served no quarter from the men behind me.  They dusted each one of them.  I wasn't going to chide the men, they were vampire hunters, I was lucky they hadn't tried to kill me yet.

We started back on Evangeline's trail, when I broke in her study she looked surprised to see me.  She tried to scurry into a corner.  She begged for her life.  I would take no quarter her.  I advanced on her and I swung both of the shadow blades through her throat.  Her head toppled to the floor and the men behind me let out a yell of joy as the flames engulfed both the head and the body.  

I turned to Dom, "Burn it all down"

He looked at me with questioning eyes, Taylor answered him, "Her flames only burn what they are set upon."

Dom nodded and he gave word to the men with flame throwers.  Evangeline's compound would burn to the ground.

We made it to the shadows in time.  The flames behind us were removing most of the shadow.  Thankfully there was only a few of us left.  We moved quickly and we were back in New Haven just in time.  The last man through was putting out a fire that had nabbed his coat sleeve.

Evangeline was gone.  Only one more Council member stood in our way, Desmond.
