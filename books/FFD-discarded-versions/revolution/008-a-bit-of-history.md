# A Bit Of History

Before long I was ready to walk around, to get a hold of my new surroundings.  I didn't want to meet any more people.  I didn't want to be around anyone actually.  They let me go.  As I walked out the door Thea touched my arm and spoke softly, "There are wards set up, it's safe to walk on the insides, you can feel them if you pay attention.  Don't go outside them."  I nodded and I think I remembered helping with the wards before I slept.  But the memories were still hazy.  Everything but the nightmares were hazy.  I could still see them when I closed my eyes.  I wouldn't be sleeping anytime soon.

The moon was low on the horizon, it was still early yet.  The notion made me smile, early for a vampire that was.  I looked up and saw stars and more stars.  The last night sky I had watched was cloudy and light from the lightning flashing from a distance.  Images of the Twin Towers standing and then fallen flashed through my eyes.  I saw the Statue of Liberty standing and then fallen and her grand head missing.  I blinked at the night sky trying to regain reality.  I walked into the woods to clear my head.

I walked until I found a small running creek.  I stopped and stared at the water babbling over the rocks.  It was peaceful.  A voice whispered from the other side of a large conifer tree.  "Of course we'd agree on a peaceful setting."  Tony walked around the tree through the creek then sat on a fallen log near me.  He watched the water, he didn't look at me.  So I continued to watch the water as well.

We stared in silence.  I listened to the crickets chirping on the night wind.  Toads croaked their own chorus.  It was nature's symphony.  Tony broke the silence, "I'm sorry about earlier."

I turned to look at him.  I could see him as clearly as if we were standing in a well light room.  I probably saw him better now in the dark.  He was as gorgeous as I remembered him being centuries before.  "Sorry about what?"

He looked up at me with sorrow, "For saying what I did back there."

It was my turn to be snarky.  "Oh, you don't mean when The Council condemned me to death by my own hand."

He got up to leave and I wasn't going to stop him I didn't really want to be around people.  I turned to watch the creek again.  The symphony no longer played in the night air.  It was quiet.  Too quiet.  I turned to look for a predator, but there was nothing around, I could feel no animals near, only Tony and myself.  He was still standing there, but he'd turned to watch me.  He spoke softly, "About that too.  I should have warned you."

I turned to him, "You mean you knew before I did."  I should have been angrier than I was.

He sighed, "Yeah.  If you didn't kill yourself I was ordered to kill you."  He looked pained at saying the words.

I sank to the ground in pain.  My own pain, my own memories, which was a far cry less painful than what I'd just endured.  But it hurt none-the-less.  Tony's voice grew even quieter, "But it doesn't matter now.  Nothing is as it was."

"You mean the Towers fell and the White House is destroyed."  I was being sarcastic.

He knelt beside me and looked at me as if he were studying me, to catch me in a lie, "How did you know that?"

I stood up quickly, and Tony fell back startled.  "I was being sarcastic."  I had raised my voice more than I had intended to, a critter scurried out from under the bush near us and ran in the opposite direction.

Tony stood up and grabbed my arms and shook me, "The Twin Towers did fall.  DC is gone.  The US of A is no longer a functioning nation."  Tony shook me harder.  "And it's YOUR fault."

I threw his arms off me in a blast of strength I didn't know I had.  He fell backwards and I grabbed for the sword that should have been at my waist, but there was nothing there and I looked a fool.  I searched around the area but I didn't find my sword.  Where was my sword?

I looked up and found Tony staring at me.  "You really have been asleep all these years."

I fought back the anger that was rising up in me.  It was bringing surging memories of the night I'd fled the council.  My nightmares flooded my memories.  I sank to the ground again, almost in tears.  "I dreamt of that night."

Tony stared at me from above with knowing eyes.  

"Not the night I left, the night I killed that town."  Tony's eyes softened.  "I saw their faces.  I felt their hearts beating, their pulses fade, and their throats in my hands as ripped them out."

Tony knelt down beside me.  "I'm sorry."

"Not your fault.  But that was only the beginning.  I saw planes crash into the Twin Towers.  I saw the mushroom cloud above Manhattan.  I saw the destruction of DC.  I dreamt all of it.  And you are telling me it all happened?"  I was saddened; the history of this great nation was gone.

Tony nodded, "That was the start of the war with The New Order."

Tony paused and we sat in silence.  He looked back at me, "If you had killed them, we wouldn't be here now."  He wasn't talking about this time and this place, he meant in this situation.  He blamed me for it.  I don't think I blamed him either.  Hind sight is always 20/20.  

"And I'd be dead."  I stood up and started to walk away.  

Tony grabbed my arm.  "I'm sorry.  I am.  But while you slept, your friends died.  My family turned against me."  I turned to look at Tony, a tear slide down his tanned cheek.  It was covered in soot, or something, the tear streaked the grim on his face.  I wiped it away.  

"Turned against you?"  I wasn't sure what he meant by that.  There were so many holes to fill.

He gave me a faint smile but it didn't last long as he told me the New Order storming Dangdburgh.  "Once the human government was overthrown, The New Order came to Dangdburgh.  They came to kill the Council and the Elder Circle.  They had intended to take them out first, but when they found out you had gone missing, they did the weakest link first."  He tried to hide his anger at me. "We were all at your estate when they came for us."

"The humans in the city ran as the army of undead and human alike marched on it.  Your Lessers tried to negotiate with them.  Their terms were simple surrender or die.  "

"Sal and Charles tried to get us all to surrender, but only half of your council did; only Charles did on our side of the leadership.  Sierra and China opted to survive than to fight with the rest of us."  

"The rest of us gathered together in a room waiting to be stormed by our own friends and family until my son, you remember Henry? Until Henry popped out of the room through a growing shadow.  He came back the same way with a grin so wide we all started laughing; it was his first shadow walk.  We all took hands and we popped from shadow to shadow until we didn't know where we were.  We all tightened our shields and hoped they didn't come for us.  We were safe for the time being."

"A short time later we met Tristan, and we trained the resistance the best we could."  He smiled at me. "Why didn't you tell me about him?"

I knew exactly who he was talking about, his son, Anthony Giovanni, the second.  "I wasn't supposed to see you again when I found out I was with child."

"How?" Tony asked with so much naivety that I laughed.

"You know damn well how?"

He grinned, "You know what I mean."

"I don't know.  I guess I'm more like you than anyone ever thought."

Tony put his arm around me and sat down on the damp sand, "My dad knew.  Or suspected anyway, that's why he helped to create you."  He leaned into my ear and whispered, "And why he introduced us."

I smiled then I blushed as I felt his breath on my neck.    I closed my eyes and enjoyed the closeness.  I missed it.  My heart ached for Tony.  He pulled away from me and my heart sank, he'd fallen in love with Sierra, I knew that.  I knew he loved her and I had let it be.  I couldn't have been with him anyway, he was happy.  But now my heart ached.

He took a deep breath and continued his story, "We've been fighting them under the banner of The Coalition of Humans and Supernatural Beings."  He laughed, "Most people call it the CHSB - the name's really long."

Tony gestured behind us.  "When your furry friend found us we were retreating from a failed mission against one of their units."

"My furry friend?"  I was confused.

He laughed, "David West.  There are actually several here.  You've been eating them mostly."  He pulled the IV from my arm.  I had forgotten it was there.

"Eating them?"  It sounded worse that it really was, but it made Tony smile and it was worth the bit of uncharacteristic effort it took for me to make a joke.  

"Ha ha, funny.  You know what I mean."  I nodded and smiled.  "It's good to see you smile.  You need it.  But back to the point, it appears that this is a Therian sanctuary of sorts.  Dimitri was surprised when David told him where you were.  He and Edmund had been here on and off for the past twelve years."

I lowered my gaze in morning.  Edmund had been more than a friend when I trained with Dimitri.  

"We've all lost people.  I'm sorry about your family, Cari."

"My family?"  I was confused, before realizing Tony wasn't there when I told everyone else.    "They aren't dead."

Before I could finish what I was going to say Tony interrupted me, "They were captured."  He turned his face from me.

I reached out and turned his face to me.  "They aren't dead.  They were captured.  They are alive, if you can call what they are living."  I paused, he looked at me we sorrow mixed with anger.  He didn't believe me.  I put both my hands on his face and opened my mind to him.  The nightmares and memories flooded into Tony so he could see and feel and believe me.   He pulled away from me in horror.

Tony backed away from me in a crab crawl looking at me like I had done those things.  He backed into a tree trunk and stopped with a startled look on his face.  He stared at me while he processed the information.  I had nothing more to say, but I waited for him to understand.

My arm started to burn, the smell of burning flesh always made me wretch in disgust.  It took me several seconds before I realized my skin was burning.  The sun was already above the horizon, but the thick canopy of trees kept most of the sun out.  I couldn't stay here.  I tried to focus on Tony, but he was already standing before me covering the sun spot with his hand.  

"We can't move in to town here.  I already tried."  Tony looked around frantically for some place I could stay.
