# The Compound

I was out for a few hours as my body healed.  I woke to find Ryan and Ant hovering over me.  Tony and the others had fled to the safety of the clan.  We were left alone to do what needed to be done.  There was no salvaging what was between Tony and I.  There was nothing left of us.  But that was a thing for another time.  I looked up at the two men who were the one constant in my life and nodded, "Let's go.  We have a job to do."

We had to keep going east.  I think we wound up going in circles a couple times.  Ryan started making scratches along the wall with his knife so we could keep track of things.  And we had gone in circles at least once. We had to try west for a while.  It dashed our hopes a little that we'd actually find a way into the compound from the city itself that was not blocked.

We could have walked for days if it were not for Ryan.  The catacombs were huge under the city, larger than even I had explored so many years ago.  I felt the gentle hum of magic in front of us.  It was a dead end, everyone had already turned around, but I knew what this was.  A man names Josh had helped me set it up.  I felt for the wards and found them.  I smiled then called back behind me, "We are here."

The three still with us stared at me like I was insane.  I didn't care they were minor in comparison to what my friends meant.  They stared at me and waited.  Ant watched me as I pulled the ward down.  He smiled as he reached up and pulled the sheet down.  He remembered what I had done that day back with Josh.  He grinned at me happily.  We had found the compound.  But how much of it was left.  If we were lucky maybe the artifacts were not buried if they were we'd have to come back one day and rescue them.  But they would be safe until then, if we could only find them.

We spread out.  We all went there own separate ways.   We had a large compound to explore and it would be quicker to do this way.

I wandered the halls kicking in doors looking for things that might be useful or survivors.  We had only one goal in mind, but you never know what else might come in handy.

Room after room led to nothing.  I found nothing.  The walls and ceilings had fallen in several corridors and I had to back track to find another way around.  I walked around for a while with no results.  

I started to recognize some of the landscape of the halls.  Memories flooded my mind, the girls clung to me.  I walked in front of Tony I could feel his eyes on my back as he watched me.  I walked carefully through the corridor and found a door already open.  I stepped in and saw the small bed they had wheeled into the room with me and the girls on it.  

I started to feel that nagging feeling that someone wanted me, Ant was calling to me. 

I made my way through the corridors towards Ant, searching as I went.  There was no point to not cover as much ground as we could.  

I found Ant and Ryan standing in the middle of what had been the conference room.  Maps were scattered everywhere, rocks had fallen onto the table leaving it a massive wreck.  But in the corner the artifacts lay unharmed.  I scanned the area for magic and found only Aurora's unique signature.  "Look for veils for anything else hiding."

Ant looked, but they weren't going to find anything Aurora might have hidden.  "I will look, you start packing the items carefully."

Ryan hadn't waited for instruction he had already started picking up items and carefully packing them in his backpack.  The other three started to help him.  "I guess we could just shadow walk to the rendezvous spot."

Ant smiled, "That's probably best since we don't know if there is any other way out except through the estate or Frozen."

"There is nothing else hidden.  We can go once we get these packed up."  I looked to Ant and Ryan, "There are no other stashes are there?"

They shook their head, "No, Aurora kept everything here she had taken."

I nodded and grumbled.  Ryan laughed, "Still sore about that huh?"

I smiled, "They should not have been moved."

"We were looking for all the help we could get."  Ryan defended Aurora with venom.

I sighed and let it be.  I was tired of this fight.  I was tired of being blamed for this damned war.

We packed up all the artifacts and we gathered outside in the hall then we stepped into the shadows to go home.
