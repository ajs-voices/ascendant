# Making Plans

Francesco walked in with Tristan sitting on one side of me and Tony on the other side.  He laughed, "Well I didn't expect this.  I suppose it fits with your plans Tristan."

I looked up at Tristan, he smiled, "I talked with Francesco about being Chevalier."

I asked, "Whose?"

He smiled, "Does it matter now?"

I laughed, "Yes and no."

He looked up at Tony, "Before, you said something."  

Tony smiled, "I was wondering when you were going to ask."  He leaned over me and kissed Tristan with a passion that made Francesco squirm a little.  I smiled at the two men.  "That clears it up."

Tristan looked breathlessly back at me and smiled, "Why yes and no?"

"If you join us you die when we die.  If you join another you live when we die, but you die when they die."  It was fact he had to understand.

Tony laughed, "What she's trying to say is.  Your life is tied to the one you join.  But what I think what she wanted to know which of the two of us you had intended to ask."

Tristan looked embarrassed and Tony patted his hand.  "It's okay to choose her.  She's the one that can sustain more than I can.  And my people frown on it."

Francesco cleared his throat.  "We have other plans if you three have time.  The surveillance came in."

Eve looked over at us, "There is another problem."

I stood up and tried to find some clothes.  Eve handed me a clean pair of jeans and a t-shirt.  Not my style, but it would work.  I got dressed and Francesco guffawed and turned around.  "What sort of problem?"

I pulled the shirt over my head, "Virgil employed Christopher and he tried to kill us."

"Why didn't alarms raise?" 

We shrugged, and Francesco hurried out of the room.  "We need to move faster now."

I followed and the men stammered behind me.  But they followed quickly.

Everyone who mattered was already in the room they used for meetings like this.  Aurora smiled at me and then frowned when she saw the two men absently grab my hands from behind.  She watched us for a few quick seconds before smiling.  She got up from the table and hugged Tristan and whispered, "Welcome to the family."  He smiled.

Francesco put his arm around Aurora, "Didn't expect that did you?"

She smiled up at her man, "She's happy, that's what matters."  She looked at us, "They are happy."  She pursed her lips, "Let get these bastards."  I had never seen the venom in her eyes before.  She really wanted to make a strike at them that hurt.

They sat and talked about the layout, where my family was being held.  I stood in the back listening, watching.  Everyone was involved in the meeting.  I'd seen everything I needed to I was about to leave when Tony looked up.  "NO"

I stopped mid step.  He grabbed my arm, "You won't do this alone again."

Tristan looked at us with confusion.  Tony waggled a finger at Tristan.  He got up and he slit my wrist with his fingernail.  He offered my wrist to Tristan.  Tristan looked confused.  Tony was angry at me, "I can't control her alone.  I need your help."  

I looked at Tristan, "He's telling you to drink.  Become Lesser now."

Tristan nodded with understanding and I bit his wrist and said the words that formed the magic and just like that Tristan popped into my head.  I could feel his hunger.  I pulled my wrist away, "You need to eat more.  We'll kill each other."

Tony laughed, "Well I guess that means it worked."

Tristan grabbed my hand and pulled me to the table.  "What were you going to do?"  

Aurora laughed, "She was going to go in and rescue her friends without anyone else, what else?"

Tristan glared at her, "No I meant, how?  I knew she was going in alone, she sees something we are missing."

"You think like humans."

He stood up offended.  Tony tried to clarify, "She means..."

"I mean you think with only human weapons in mind."

"That's all we have."

"No it's not.  You have Primeval Vampires who can walk into shadows and come out someplace else."

Tristan nodded, "Yeah we tried that they seem to have their shadows guarded."

"With silver bullets?"

Tristan shook his head, "Only the most important people over there get silver."

I smiled and Tristan understood.  "You meant to just walk in and let them shoot you."

I nodded, Tony laughed, "She did it before."

I took a red pen and marked the offices of the important people.  "Silver is here then."  I moved one of the little figures they were using for our side and put it a place that was always shadow and I moved one to the shadows closet to where they were holding my family.  "We come in here and here.  I will be here."  I pointed to the closest to my family, "The rest serve as a distraction.  Only fast healers get to go."  I put my hand on Tristan's chest and pushed him to his seat, "You stay here."

He stood up, "No way.  You aren't keeping me here."

Tony smiled, "Stay with her, and do not leave her side for even a moment.  She'll make sure you live."  He turned to the rest of them.  "I'll provide distraction.  Who else?"

Alex and David volunteered.

"In and out, nothing fancy."  Tristan took over again.
