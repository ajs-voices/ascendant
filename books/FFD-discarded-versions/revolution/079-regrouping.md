# Regrouping

When the scouts came back they reported to me and were surprised to see me with Tony's arm around my shoulder.  Desmond was in the worse place he could be.  He was with Brandon.  It was either a tactical advantage or he was a coward, I took favor with the later having known Desmond most of my life.  He was never overly brave but he was intelligent, though I don't put that into strategy, but with Desmond being the last remaining Lieutenant alive, it was a good plan.  However it made our lives more difficult.  There was also one disadvantage - I had taught Desmond, in a one and one fight he could be dangerous.

Ant and Ryan saw that we were with one of the scouts and came over.  They weren't overly surprised by the outcome, and they agreed it was going to be a harder battle.  Ant looked surprised to see me and Tony together.  Ryan jabbed him in the ribs and whispered to him.   He just grinned at me with a childish look on his face.

The scout ignored us and laid out all the information he'd discerned from his trip to Brandon's lair within what remained of the White House in Washington, DC.  Jesse and Tony and Davyn along with Taylor, Dom and Rick joined us.  They all listened and plotted and planned.  I listened to the whole thing.  The First Therians were the last to join us, claiming they had food in their teeth.  I laughed at the thought and everyone looked at me as if I hadn't been there.

Dom raised an eyebrow and questioned everything, "If she's the leader why isn't she speaking?"

Tony laughed, "She's not tactical as you'd like to think she is.  She's a risk taker, a guns a blazing type gal.  Unless you want the rest of your men dead, we will let her listen and then she can make her points when we have a plan."

"But if she's going to change it why are we making plans?"  Dom didn't look like changed much.

Tony explained, "She won't change it.  We'll work around what she ends up doing, which at this point it's going to be shadow walk to the nearest point."  Tony paused and pointed, "Here probably. Closest to Brandon.  She's not in a mercy mode so she'll not chase him, she'll use fear and intimidation and if he runs instead of cowers she'll light his backside on fire."  He laughed.

I smiled, "Couldn't have said it better myself."

Dom nodded, "So if she's guns a blazin then why do we need to go?"

Ryan giggled, "Have you ever had a plan go exactly right.  There are likely a billion vampires and humans with guns between that point and Brandon.  Not to mention traps and various other magical interferences.  He knows we are coming.  He'll do anything to take Cari down."

Dom nodded, "So we are the distraction basically?"

Ryan shook his head, "No we are all part of the plan, what Cari does is go for the kill.  She'll be the only one of us who can take Desmond or Brandon down.  Though anyone here can probably take Desmond down, but he could be better than last Cari saw him.  But we all have to have good mental shields with Desmond.  He can make you cower in fear with a mere thought or make you sing to the heavens your praise to him.  He can make you feel like doing anything."

I interrupted, "He's just as dangerous as Evangeline or Alec or Valentine.  They all use their talents to defend themselves.  And they all know how to do it well. They've been alive much longer than you or I."  And for me that is saying a lot.

Dom nodded and they continued their plotting and planning.  We were nearly ready.  I left after Dom had given up his concerns.  I had to do a part of the mission before everyone left.  The humans needed protection and Skylar and I had some work to do.
