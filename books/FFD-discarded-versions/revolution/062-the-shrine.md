# The Shrine

We continued to the east whenever we could.  We hadn't found any damaged areas yet, but we had no idea how far we had gone in the right direction either, the way had been very twisty-turny up to this point.  But the catacombs were starting to look familiar to me.  Not compound familiar but familiar from a time centuries ago when I explored the caverns below the city.  

The walls had a faint glow to them.  It wasn't enough to brighten the way but it was there if you looked hard enough.  The walls were etched with ancient symbols and pictogram.  Ant stopped to exam some while we all walked through the corridors.  I watched as he traced one symbol as if he'd seen it before but couldn't remember.  I put my hand on his shoulder with an encouraging push to not linger long.  I had only seen these symbols in one other place.  I was surprised that Tony had not stopped to look at them.  Maybe he didn't see the magic as Ant and I did.  Ryan and Tony were very focused on the darkness.

They stopped in front of us and Ant and I nearly ran them over, stopping on their heels.  I peered into the room and saw what they stared at.  A large monolithic idol stood in the center of a large cavern.  The magically glow here was obvious and the cavern was very well lit.  I was amazed that it still stood, perhaps even the New Order feared the First.  Tony stared, he knew what it was.  I could feel the fear in his mind you could see his muscles tremble as he dared not step into the light.  

Ant was curious and he stepped into the room.  Tony had tried to grab him but in his attempt to grab his son and stay out of the room he lost his balance and stumbled into the light of the room.  The other three stood behind us and stared the vampires knew what it was.  They knew their rituals as did Tony.  

There was no time between Tony stumbling and when he grabbed my wrist and forcefully threw me against the shrine.  The magic bound my wrists.  Ant and Ryan started to come to my rescue, but I shook my head.  I hadn't been certain but I thought we might come upon this fertility shrine.  

Back in the day, the First used this as their marriage ceremony, the first consecration of the marriage and the procreation of their race.  Today it was pretty much forgotten, but the magic was still strong.  I could feel it pressing down on us.  I was here willingly, the power flowed through me, I could imagine the fight in Tony's mind and body.  He hadn't been prepared for this eventuality, was it cruel not to tell him of ifs and maybes?  At the time I had thought no, but now looking at the pain in his eyes at hurting me I think I was in the wrong then.  I smiled at him to reassure him and the confusion and pain turned to anger.  

The anger ripped through his body and took control.  The magic fueled his already strong empathy.  What could have been a pleasurable exercise in the marital bliss, but his anger made it something more primal.  My clothes did not make the transition.  And I was sore from the force of the encounter.  But the magic and the pain of pleasure more than made up for the assault on my body.  Tony on the other hand collapsed to the ground in exhaustion.  I felt the power leave us a gift.  Tony looked up at me with sadness, joy and concern all in one look as he felt the conception of our next child - a son from the feeling the First magic gave us both.  I smiled at him and the magic release my wrists.

I knelt down in front of Tony and put my hands on his face.  He didn't know whether to be mad at me or to welcome the new chance to raise our children.  Twice we had failed in the process.  Maybe this time it would be different.  Ant, Morgan and Carissa were of us, but Ant I had raised without Tony, and the girls had grown for five years a sleep with me.  There was no raising the baby to become toddler to young child for them.  They just were.  This was a third chance to be the parents we could be together.

I leaned in and whispered in Tony's ear, "It's okay.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you.  We will make this work."

He grabbed my hands and pulled me closer to him, he was still angry and he was hurting my wrists.  He pushed me back to the ground and lay on top of me.  "Is this your idea of fun?"

I shook my head.  "They why didn't you tell me?"

"Should I tell you every if and maybe we might run across?  The First magic moves, I don't know where it will be."  I tried to push Tony off of me, but it was like moving a mountain.  "I didn't even know if it would work.  I am not one of you."

Tony pushed my wrists harder into the ground. I fought back the moan of pleasure at his rough treatment.  He glared at me and pushed harder, "You are now.  You were reborn."

I fought against Tony but it did little good, "I was born human, I died human.  I was reborn but I will always be human at my core."

Tony stared down at me.  We stared at each other.  I tried to get up again but Tony pushed me back down.  He kissed me forcefully but I let his passion flow into me.  The room began to glow, the First magic was back and it was entering our bodies again.  Tony pushed himself inside of me and let my arms go so I could wrap myself around him.  He started to be rough, but he eased down and we made passionate love.  The first magic flowed in us we could feel its power enhancing our love making.  I felt the magic split the embryo inside me.  I shuttered and we climaxed together and the child that the magic had made had given us identical twin boys.  We both collapsed in exhaustion, the magic lingered but no longer rode our passion.  

I saw images in my mind the magic was speaking to me.  It wanted me to do something.  Images of a young man in a diner waiting,  I nodded my assent, I would do as it asked, but I really had no idea what it wanted from me.  It gave me the feeling that I would know when I knew.  Vague answers always sucked.  The magic lingered with me but did not take part anymore, it was happy to stay with me.

But the events were not over, Tony stood above me naked in all his glory and he was angry.  "Why do you do this to me?"

I asked, "Do what?"

"You manipulate me.  You make me do things I don't want to do.  You've always done it."

I just stared at him in wonder.  I saw Ant and Ryan from the corner of my eye, they stayed away, but they watched for malintent.

"I don't manipulate you."

"Then your magic does without your consent."  Tony picked up his sword from the ground and pulled it from it's sheath.  Anger filled his eyes.  The storm of his anger was coming.

Ant stepped between us facing me, "Don't kill him, Cari.  He's my father.  We need him.  I need him."

Tony pushed Ant out of the way, "I don't need a boy protecting me.  I can defend my own self."

Ant shrugged as he picked himself up off the ground, "Have it your way."

There was little time between Ant starting his sentence to Tony's sword piercing my abdomen.  I saw it all happen.  I didn't react.  I felt his silver blade cleave the embryos inside of me.  I felt the blood gush into my womb.  The inhuman cells of the children tried to survive, but I felt their lights flicker from existence as I dropped to my knees with a sword piercing my body from front to back.

I looked up at Tony and there was fear in his eyes.  I pulled his sword out and threw it to the ground beside me.  I collapsed to the ground and there was nothing but the dark inside my mind to comfort me.
