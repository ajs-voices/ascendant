# Trouble In Paradise

We walked into the shadows to the south of the village, but there was no doubt there was a disturbance at the village.  Every person I was connected to was fine, but the air was still unsettling.  I didn't run, but I moved quickly with Jake and Nick following behind me to the center of the village.

The circle of elders were shouting with others.  Tony was on one side, Jesse and the rest of my family was on the other.  That did not bode well.  It seemed they were fighting amongst each other as well.  My dream came to me and I knew what to expect.  As I resolved my constitution to make the move to join the commotion I felt the deep sadness wash over me, but it wasn't mine.  I stopped and stared at Tony.  He looked away from me.  I sighed and walked to the meeting of minds.

Donatello was the first too notice I had joined them.  He held up his hand and everything quieted.  He didn't smile or show any emotion.  "Cari, there is a problem."

"I figured that, what is it?"

"The weapons you are in possession of and are capable of making are in violation of our laws."  Donatello was void of all emotion.

"And?"

He sighed, "We have no choice but to banish you and any other who possess these weapons from our clan.  Violations such as these render all clan times null and void.  We will remove all bonds from you that connect you to the clan except for those of natural making such as parents and children."

I asked, "When?"

"As soon as possible.  You will be able to gather your things and say your good-byes and then you can never come back to clan lands again."  There was sadness in Donatello at that final statement.

I nodded.  "Fine.  I'm taking what belongs to my care with me." 

He sighed, "We know."

I turned and left.  You could tell who was with me as they followed me.  I was surprised to see Jesse and Henry following me.  We would discuss it when we were away from the crowd.

We gathered what little we actually owned from the various houses we'd been staying in.  Nicola hugged me tightly when she saw me.  She smiled up at me, "Henry likes you, he believes in you.  He and his dad aren't getting along anyway."

She answered my unasked question.  I hadn't known Tony and Henry had been fighting.  But then Tony rarely shared things with me about his past family.  And when it was it was always tinged with anger.  He still hated me for Sierra and China.  I don't blame him, but I was getting tired for the full blame.  They choose the other side, I didn't make them.

Meelah frowned at me from the distance.  I smiled to reassure her we'd be okay.  She spoke softly, "I don't agree with the circle or Tony, but the law is the law."

I hugged Meelah, "Don't worry about us.  We'll be fine.  I understand, I do."  

Meelah handed me a basket.  "Just some food I know the kids will like."  I smiled, she was going to be missed by all of us.

I saw Tony standing in the door way.  Meelah left us alone.  I really didn't want to talk to him, but we probably shouldn't leave it just alone like we always have.  Good-bye's would be final this time. 

Tony looked down, but he didn't say anything so I started, "Look Tony.  I love you.  I get it okay.  We are done, no need to make this harder.  I have no hard feelings, but I can't do this with you."

He glared at me, "Do what, say I'm sorry.  Say I love you? Wish I could go with you? Don't do what?"

I laughed, "You don't want to go with me.  You and I haven't been like we use to be in centuries.  We love the past, the present and the future neither of us fit together anymore.  You are angry with me about your wife and daughter.  You don't like the way I live my life, the way I raise my children.  I get it Tony.  We just don't fit.  Let's not beat the horse any more, it's been dead for a long time."

He frowned never looking up, "I love you, I do.  I just..."

I put a finger on his mouth, "No Tony.  Leave it at I love you.  I love you too.  We'll deal with the fall out.  I'm sorry you and Henry are having issues.  I will take care of him like he is my own."

Tony nodded.  "Thank you.  I wasn't even going to ask.  I know you well enough to know he's family to you now, despite me."

"This is it." I muttered mostly to myself.

I sighed, "Don't come looking for us.  I don't want to see you again.  It's not that I don't care or don't love you.  It's too hard. I can barely stand it now.  I don't know what years of missing you will do.  So just don't."

He nodded and I walked past him with my things and the basket Meelah made in my hands.  We all gathered at the village green where the breaking would occur.  All off my clanned vampires stood with me and waited for Donatello to break the bonds to the clan.  I was also breaking a marriage and my Chevalier bond to Tony.  I wasn't sure what that would do.  I had never seen a Chevalier bond broken from the outside.  And I barely survived the last one.

Donatello stood in silence as we watched him wave his hands and gather the bonds from the clan.  I could see the magic.  I was eldest by their law.  I was the strongest, but now I was being banished for trying to save them.  Trying to save the humans, that was probably a big reason why they were banishing us.  It wasn't just vampires we were saving but the cattle we eat.  I hated that philosophy on life.  

That was my last thought before all I could feel was searing pain running though my body.  And then there was nothing but the pain in the darkness.
