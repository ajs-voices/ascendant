# A Half Of The Whole

We let Ant lead the way, even though it really wasn't necessary.  I could find the council without trying too hard. We walked slowly, even Ant didn't want to get where we were going quickly. I think he was enjoying having two parents at the same time. There was an extra skip in his step. I smiled. Tony caught my mood and swatted Ant in the head playfully. "You are making your Mum here wish for days we never had."

I elbowed Tony but I didn't mean it.  He was probably right.  We wound up at what could only be called a long hall.  It was a large building that held only one room, their meeting hall.  Table chairs were lined along the wall, but there was a large round table in the middle of the room.  At the table sat many faces I knew and others I didn't.

I, of course, saw Aurora.

On Aurora's right sat Francesco, his hand was next to Aurora's on the table, but no one seemed to notice but me. Marie sat next to him and Henry next to her. Henry spoke with Tristan. Ryan sat next to Tristan. There was an empty seat next to Ryan that Ant took when he had entered with us.

There were two empty seast between Thea and Ant.  Tony sat down next to Ant.  I waited for the final seat to fill.   But everyone turned to look at me.  The room was sitting in silence.  Aurora laughed, "She's not use to being in this situation."  She got up from her seat with a casual caress of Francesco's shoulder, she came to stand beside me.  She put her arm around my waist and directed me to the chair.  "Sit, dear one.  This is not a council meeting."  I did as she said, but she was right this was foreign territory for me.

Aurora walked back to her chair but she didn't sit, she stood behind it, with her hands on the back of the chair.  "In this room sits some of the most power people in the world."  She let her words sink in.  She smiled, "Like the Knights in Arthur's Court, we sit in a circle, none having more power than any other at this table.  We are the leaders, our people follow."  I was no leader; I pushed back my chair to stand up.  Aurora looked at me and I stayed put but I didn't pull my chair closer.  I was wary.  "We each lead in our own way.  Some of us take up arms against the foe.  Others of us sit in the background making plans.  And yet others keep us safely hidden so that we way may live to fight another day."

"Yesterday we may have found a key to winning the war.  But before we get to that, we need to lay all our cards on the table.  No more secrets among us, but we will not judge.  Who would like to speak first?"

Aurora sat down, and Francesco stood up as if they had been practicing for hours. He looked at me. "I conspired to add new blood to my people. I gave the former council of vampires the key to making their Enforcers. The first was a success. The second was not so great." He smiled, "Though Cari got off to a rocky start, I never expected to have the sane one end up the rotten egg." He took a deep breathe. "I introduced my son to Cari in hopes of adding a new element to our blood line. My dream has since died." I was surprised, to hear that, didn't he know about Ant?

Aurora stood up next to Francesco and took his arm.  She looked at each of in turn.  "Francesco and I have been seeing each other for nearly 800 years."  I nodded.  I was of few who had seen their relationship in its infancy.  She looked at me and then Tony, "Anyone else?"

They sat down and I looked at Tony.  But it was Thea who stood up next.  "In the sake of honesty, I did not believe vampires were not monsters.  My mother told me to believe and I would see the truth.  When Cari came to me for help, I was startled.  But she didn't step out and kill me.  I know now that vampires are much more like their human kin than anyone had ever known.  Some are savage but others, "she looked at me, "others can be safe." 

Ryan laughed but quickly stifled it.  "No offense, but Cari is far from safe."

Thea nodded her head, "I know.  I've seen her dreams.  I've looked into her soul and seen the darkness.  I've seen the blood on her hands.  But I see honor and loyalty.  I feel safe."

Ryan nodded in agreement.  Thea sat down.  

No one stood up; everyone looked down at the table, except for those that had spoken.

Tony stood up, pulling me to my feet.  He looked at his father and mother, "Father, Mother, you believe we can only mate with one."  They nodded.  Tony looked down at Ant, he smiled and stood up.  "I'd like you introduce you to our son."  He pulled me closer to him, "Anthony Giovanni the Second."  

Marie stood up, "That's impossible you mated with Sierra".

Tony shook his head.  "No Mother, I mated first with Cari.  When the council forbade us to be together I sought another to fill the void.  I fell in love with Sierra, but I have always loved Cari."

I spoke quietly, "I assure you, he is Tony's son."

Aurora cleared her throat.  "Finish!  Unveil all."

At the command I removed my personal shadow as did Tony.  On our right arms was a tattoo of a thick thorny vine.  Thea nearly fainted.  But she caught herself and stood up.  "May I explain?"  Tony and I both nodded.

"My many centuries gone my great grandmother wed these two with living magic.  She tied their souls together."  She tilted her head in askance, not sure if that was right.  "I guess that would be right, since a vampire's soul is not gone.  Where one soul goes, the other will follow.  Death, life, heaven hell, whatever you believe in.  They are tied together.  The vine thickens with the years, it grows stronger.  The thorns grow sharper and longer to protect its precious fruit.  This is the strongest vine I have ever seen."  She looked up at us in awe.

Aurora stood up, "They aren't done yet.  I know they've given us many questions but there is more."

I shook my head, I wasn't about to tell them the last secret.  Tony looked at me, and pulled me close.  "She won't tell, and I can't go against her wishes.  But in all fairness to the group, Aurora will speak for us."

Aurora sighed but nodded, "We all know vampires take Chevalier.  But Cari found the process to make it permanent.  What we call Chevalier are not Chevalier, but Lesser Chevalier, they are only partially bound to us with the possibility to leave at any time."

Ryan stood up, "I'll finish, it's my secret as well."

Aurora smiled and sat down, she was glad.  Ryan moved to stand with his arm around my shoulder.  "Cari bound our soul to a human, and she sent them all to hell when she killed a murderer."  All eyes were on us.  "My soul, Mia's, Tony's and Cari's were bound to that man who had killed a girl in front of us."  

There was a gasp in the room, someone whispered, "That's impossible."

Aurora spoke over the whispers, "I am certain that what they have done is unbreakable.  I have found the book Cari used.  And despite what we think, vampires can become Chevalier to another.  You kill one of those four and they will all die."  

There was silence in the room.  No one moved, it was as if everyone was holding their breath.

Henry broke the silence, "So we've been sending Tony and Ryan into battle knowing we could have killed Il Cane della Morte, the one person who could have prevented this war, and who can potentially stop it.  You tried to kill our only weapon against them."

It was my turn and I was fighting back the rage inside me.  I stood up nearly flinging my chair across the room.  "This is not my fault I pointed across the table at the former council.  "They were going to kill me, by my own hand.  I could not kill your father.  I could not kill my friends."  I turned and tried to leave the room, but Tony grabbed my hand and pulled me back to him.  I turned and buried my face in his chest and cried.

There was stunned silence as I cried openly.  Tony turned to the room, "We left her friends to die.  We left her family in the hands of the enemy.   They live still.  They have been tortured every day for the past twelve years.  It drove Cari to the insanity we saw in her when we first woke her.  She's fighting her beast and the nightmares.  She can't control everything.  She is only a half of the whole.  We need to fix this or the weapon we hoped is gone for good."

I looked up at Tony.  He stared down at me with tears in his eyes.  He mouthed, "I'm sorry."  And I returned the gesture.
