# Revelations

It seems like yesterday that I joined with Tony.  Technically it wasn't that long ago that Tony and I had performed a similar ceremony to make it official, though we had been bound together for many centuries without the clan knowing.  And now I bind myself to an unknown person for the sake of the future, not just my future, but everyone I cared about.  

Davyn seems like a good man, he's defiantly sees the big picture and cares for his community.  Jarl, mayor whatever you want to call it, he's a leader among those in New Haven.  I only hope that his tying himself to me is good for them and not seen as a blight on their community.

I felt a hand on my shoulder, "Having second thoughts?"

I looked over my shoulder to see Davyn and shook my head, "No, just hoping that you've thought through the ramifications of this juncture."

He smiled and put his arm around my shoulder, "I have, and the community voted in favor of the union.  They not only want you to be part of the family they have openly accepted The Hound of Death as a leader amongst leaders."

I shook my head.  I still didn't believe they understood, but I wasn't going to argue about it.

"We will make this work.  You are not a leader, we get that, but we will follow when where you lead us.  You have made many changes in Dangdburgh without ever having laid a hand on the policies there.  You fit in line with us, and we have much to learn from you."  Davyn was confident in his words.  He knew exactly what he was saying and what he was getting into.  He was reassuring me that it would be alright.  I laughed.  Davyn frowned, "What's funny?"

"You reassuring me that it's going to be alright."  I smiled, "It's been a while since anyone other than Ryan or Ant has tried to reassure me."  

He smiled and hugged my shoulders.  "Come we have a ceremony to complete."

I sighed, I really hated ceremony.  It was usually meant to be a spectacle but this one was magical in nature as well, as much of vampire magic is.  A binding of two bodies, bloods and in this case bloodlines.  I wondered if this was different than what Tony and I had done.  A realization hit me and I stopped in my tracks, "You are a First vampire."

Davyn laughed, "It didn't take you long to figure that out.  Though most do not know so don't say that too loud."

I frowned, "Why are you binding your line to me?"

He smiled, "You are cursed with a First soul.  A vampire in a human body, created into a vampire by mere coincidence.  Have you ever wondered why you are the way you are?"

I shook my head, "I was made to be what I am, both by my uncle and the council.  I choose my path now for the first time in centuries."

Davyn laughed, "I would say you were a legend among my people, but it's not so.  All life is connected. Souls are reborn when one dies.  You have a first soul, like many before you and many yet to come.  It is not something we look for, but on rare occasions it's hard not to notice.  You are one such occasion."

"I do not know which soul you are, but everything you have gone through and everything you have done is because you are a First soul.  I won't say that you were meant to be raped, or that you were meant to be an assassin.  But everything led you to this point.  You are coming home.  We are uniting a first blood line.  Our children will be similar to children of the first but they will be so much more different."

Davyn smiled, "I will tell you what I know, Valence Dilanti is Puer Decem like you, but he had been driven mad with the 8 powers he had been granted.  Dilanti could only preform a minor set of what you can do.  You only do what you do because you were taught the powers and you refrain from some of the more tempting ones. ".  I started to interrupt but Davyn put a finger to my lips and shook his head, "You can do much more than you do.  You keep yourself at bay, just like you keep your hunger and your anger under a strict hand.  You do this.  No one trained you.  You know how to do this in your heart, in your soul.  You are a First in spirit if not in form."

I nodded, "It is why I was reborn the First soul granted the reprieve as it may be."  

He smiled, "It is why you were reborn, it is why the fertility statue worked for you with Tony. It is why you have two sets of twins with in a five year time frame. You were born to do exactly what you are doing now."

Sklyar and Ryan walked in chatting.  I wondered how old she was.  It was a good think for Ryan to find a friend now that his sister was gone.  I would have to ask when this was done.

Davyn turned me towards him and put both his hands on my shoulders.  "It is time."

I smiled, "This isn't a public then?"

Davyn laughed, "It can be if you like, but there is no need for this ritual."

Skylar stood to my left and Ryan to my right, we all face in towards each other.  Sklyar spoke quietly but it felt like a roar in the quiet of the ritual.  "This is like what you and Tony did before you made it official.  This is a combination of wiccan and vampire magic.  It's is neither one, but without the other it would not work."

The power rose in my soul, I could feel Davyn's pulse beneath his fingers.  I put my hands on his arms and a surge ran through both of us.  Skylar smiled, "Very good, didn't even have to tell you."  I heard her, but I didn't really hear her.  All my attention was on the rush of power flowing between the two of us. 

We let go of one another and a visible stream of energy flowed between our bodies.  Davyn reached a hand out to Skylar and I did the same to Ryan.  The power followed included them. We held our hands out to the opposite, creating a circle.  We were one.  

When we all let go of hands I still felt Ryan in my mind.  We turned to each other and we stared.  Davyn laughed, "Did we forget to mention that.  It is more like a child/parent bond than Chevalier.  But it holds the same principles.  Skylar and Ryan are our links to humanity and the wiccan powers.  They are why we are who we will become."

I blinked and Ryan smiled, "It's good to have you back, though it's odd feeling you and Ant."

I smiled. It was good to have Ryan back, even if it wasn't the same.

Davyn took Ryan by the shoulder.  "Welcome to the family, but I have something to ask of you."

Ryan looked puzzled, "Me?"

Davyn nodded, "Right now with the power flow, my Skylar is actively fertile, as are you."

Ryan stopped Davyn, "You mean right now I could become a father."  

Skylar nodded, "And I a mother."

Ryan and Skylar stared at each other for only a moment before they grasped hands and wandered into another room.

Davyn laughed, "Well that was easier than I thought it would be."

"He's wanted a child for many centuries."

Davyn nodded, "So has Skylar, though probably not as long as Ryan has.  She has only been with me for four."

I nodded. Davyn answered my question without ever having asked.

He looked down at me, "Do you always feel that?"

"Feel what?"  I asked. I felt many of things all the time.

"Like you are grasping an electrical fence?"

I shook my head, "No, only since waking up here."

"Why didn't you say something?"  He looked angry.  "That's a protection against you on our land.  I see that it wouldn't have worked anyway."

I laughed, "You mean the ground is a trap, all of it.  It's a good think I'm honorable and avoided you and your barriers."

Davyn touched the ground and removed the ward.  The pain left suddenly and I had to catch my balance.
