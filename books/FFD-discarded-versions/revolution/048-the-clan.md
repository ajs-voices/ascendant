# The Clan

Night came and everyone appeared ready, that was until we had an unexpected guest.  Out of the shadow I was standing in while waiting forever one I was fallen into.  No one was there and then suddenly Henry and Nicola were falling on top of me.  It seemed Henry was an overly accurate shadow walker.  He got up and helped Nicola up.  He dusted off before he held out a shy hand to me.

I sat on the ground looking up at Tony's son with a questioning look.  He blushed.

"I'm sorry.  We wanted to come see you."  Henry spoke cautiously, or maybe that's what it sounded like as Nicola was already blurting into my mind, "We mated."

I smiled up at Henry, and he must have taken it as a command to blurt it out, "We mated.  Me and Nicola."

I nodded, "So I've heard."

Henry looked at Nicola and his blush brightened.  He looked down at his feet.  I laughed.  "I'm happy for you."

Henry squatted to whisper to me, "You think my Dad or Granddad will be angry?"

I shook my head, "No, they've done the same."

He laughed with relief, "But you better tell them before Nicola does."

He stood up and hurried to find his father and grandfather.  Nicola fell into my lap hugging me.  "I knew you'd be happy."

I hugged the seven hundred year old 16 year old tightly, "I'm glad you are happy and found someone to love you for all you are." 

She hugged me tighter and cried happy tears into my shoulder.  

Ant and Ryan followed by the six children came out of the house to see the spectacle.  I laughed, "She's happy."  Ryan picked Nicola up effortlessly and she clung to him as Ant helped me up.  

Nicola squeaked, "I'm mated." 

Ryan hugged her then put her down.  "Congratulations.  Who's the lucky man?"

Ant hugged Nicola.  "Henry?"  He asked with a shocked question.  She must have spoke in his mind.  

Nicola nodded quickly.  Ant smiled, "Welcome to the family officially then Nicola."

I corrected Ant, "Technically she has always been part of the family."

Ant shrugged, "Like a bastard child I guess."

I nodded, "But she was family.  She's just more so now."

Tony and Henry came out in conversation and Francesco followed with Aurora with a smile on his face, he almost beamed with pride.  Behind them Dimitri came carrying a bird on his shoulder.  Carissa cried out, "Arghhhh"

Dimitri laughed and the bird flew into the heavens.  The new Il Mandria di Cane came out of the house carrying a few items, mostly food stuffs they'd been given for the journey.  Hopefully we'd not have to use it at all, but it was a very nice gesture.

We were all here with two extras.  It appeared Henry and Nicola were coming with us.

The conclave stood around us waving and crying and shouting encouragement.  Between Henry, Tony, Francesco, Ant and myself we could easily take this crowd to our next place.  We stepped into the shadows.

We stepped out of the shadow I felt the buzzing of a ward surrounding us.  I shouted, "Hold.  No one move."

It was hard not to move.  I didn't even know how big the ward was or what it would do.  It felt similar but different to the ward that was around the place between.  Francesco sighed, "I know this magic, though I had not expected it here."

I didn't wait for Francesco's explanation; I sent my power seeking a familiar signature, or a response to mine.  I found nothing.  "Nothing here I recognize."

A man stepped out of the shadows, he was elderly and the power wafted from his being.  Everyone stared at him even I was in awe of the power.  "I doubt you will Il Cane, though I know you."

Francesco laughed, "Just let us out you old fool."

The man smiled but gave Francesco a look that said quiet without him saying a word.  

Tony smiled. "Father, please let us out."

The man shook his head, "We've much to discus and you will listen in there."

I sat down this was going to be a while.  The man laughed at me, "I'm glad I amuse you."

He laughed harder.  "She's very direct my son."

Tony and Francesco spoke in unison, "She is."

I looked up at Tony, "Who is he?"

Tony held his hand out indicating the man before us.  "Cari, this is Donatello Giovanni, my grandfather."  He smiled at his grandfather, "Father, I'd like to introduce you to Il Cane."  While Tony was introducing us I was examining the ward and found the catch.  I broke the catch and the ward fell in a silence I'd never seen happen.

Donatello smiled, 'I'd shake your hand, but you are inside the ward."  He looked at me with sly expression, "You little minx."

I smiled at him and shushed him.  He laughed.

Tony sat down next to me and the girls climbed into our laps.  Leyla and Lee sat at our sides curling up at our sides resting their heads on our shoulders.  Everyone else just stood there and waited.  I guess they were impatient to be free.  Donatello nor I told them they could move.  He wanted to speak to us, I would allow it, but I would not allow us to be hurt.

"So Father what do we need to speak of."  Francesco asked impatiently.

Donatello looked at his son, "The world has changed much since you made this one."  Francesco nodded.  "She brings new hope, new terror and new ways with her.  Some do not embrace it, but you follow her without question."

Francesco laughed, "I wouldn't say without question.  But yes I follow the child."

Donatello corrected, "Elder."

"What?"  I asked quickly.

He turned to me, "You are Elder.  You are Clan."

"I'm not Elder nor Clan."

"You are mated to him aren't you?"  He nodded to Tony.

"Yes, but not by your standards."

Donatello laughed, "You are mated.  You are clan.  We will make official.  You will be consort.  Sierra is dead.  He is entitled a second."

Tony started to stand up but I put my hand on his knee and he sat back down but he didn't stay quiet, "Cari is not consort, she is Il Cane."

"And?"  Donatello waited for Tony's explanation that seemed to never come.  "And what does that have to do with anything my son?"

Tony sighed.  I spoke instead, "I am not consort.  I am Death."

Donatello took a step closer but stopped short as he remembered his ruse.  "Even Death has a consort, Il Cane.  Are you two not happy?"

Tony was offended, "We are, but we are not Clan."

Donatello smiled, "We can fix that.  Your Il Cane brings new ways.  We... no, I accept them.  You mated before Sierra.  You held to mates.  But your bond is strong, stronger than any I've ever felt.  All of your bonds are stronger than anything I've ever felt."

Aurora spoke cautiously, "You feel more than the mating."

He raised an eye brown.  "Do I?"

She nodded, "They are bound in many - Wiccan, Chevalier and mated."

Donatello's mouth formed an O.  He hadn't known that much.  "And the children?  Can you explain that?"

Francesco nodded, "Father, she is an amplifier.  She amplifies powers given to her.  Her children and herself feed on one another's power, increasing each other's."

Donatello nodded, "That explains much."  He stood and stroked his long white beard with his fingers.  "You will all become Clan, even the humans if they desire."

I spoke for most of them, "They don't.  Only one is Chevalier, all others are lesser."

He looked at the crowd and nodded, "Which one is Chevalier and whose?"  Ant and Ryan raised their hands.  "Do you wish to be Clan, Chevalier?"

Ryan nodded, "It would be an honor."

Donatello smiled, "First, young man drop your veil so that I may see your true face."

I looked up at Ant, I had not noticed he'd veiled.  He was use to hiding who he was among the Clans.  There was no doubt he was Tony's son, and Donatello looked back at Tony and I with a shocked face and then turned to ask Ant, "How many years have you lived?"

Ant smiled, "Over 700 years."

Tony clarified, "I only found out 17 years ago I had another son."

Donatello nodded and looked at me, "You little minx."

I laughed.  Donatello waved his hand, "You may all join us."

I laughed harder.  Tony looked at me with questioning eyes, "I dropped the ward before I sat down."

Donatello looked at me in mock fury, "You little minx."

I looked up at him and smiled and turned to Tony, "I think he likes calling me that."

Tony stood up with a smile and held out a hand to help me up, which I graciously accepted.
