# Allies Unite

It wasn't long before Ant opened the door.  He was not smiling, but there was a certain energy about him.  "Some of our allies are showing up."  He stepped inside and I immediately saw why he was not smiling.  Tony was following him in, "Tony wants to talk to you.  Privately."

Davyn put his hand on my shoulder, "I'll leave you two alone, but I'm only a thought away."

I saw jealousy rise up in Tony.  That was good and bad.  Tony watched Davyn and Ant leave. If looks could kill Davyn would probably be dead.  He turned back to me with that same glare. It only softened slightly as he walked to me.

I stood and stared back at him.  I really didn't want to have to talk to him more than needed.  I was not in the mood to fight with him.

Tony took something from behind his back and handed me the small cloth package.  "You can have it back."

I took it, from the weight of it I knew what it was.  I unfolded the cloth carefully to reveal what I knew it was, the dagger I had given him when he was just a boy.  I stared back at him in confusion.

"I don't need it anymore."  It was all he said as he turned around to leave.

"I gave it to you centuries ago and now you don't want it."

He didn't turn back around, "I don't love you anymore. I don't deserve it."

"So?  It was a gift."  I put on hand on his shoulder and turned him towards me.  And put the dagger back in his hand. "You deserved it then, I don't want it back now."

Tony thrust the blade back at me.  "Cari.  Stop.  I do not want it.  I do not love you.  I don't think I ever did."

I sighed and wondered the same thing, but it was too late now.  But Tony didn't stop there, "I don't trust you anymore.  I've lost everything because of you.  You are the reason this alliance is necessary.  You are the reason we are all in this mess."

I glared back at him.  "It's not my fault Sierra and China are dead.  You killed them."

"Because I had to, it was the only way I was getting out of it alive."  

"And there you have it, you being as selfish as I was.  Only I didn't do it to save my life."  I poked him in the chest.  "I did it to save your life, and Ryan's and Mia's.  I would have gladly died to save this from happening."

Tony was glaring at me but he didn't say anything.  In a calm cool voice I spoke softly to Tony, "I'll prove it to you."  I held the hilt of the dagger out to Tony with the blade just above my heart.  "Kill me if it'll make you feel better."

"You know it won't kill you."  Tony sneered.

"But you can't do it either."  Tony took a step towards me and stopped.

I didn't wait for him, but he never moved a muscle,  I plunged the dagger into my heart.  I felt it stop beating and I collapsed to the floor.

I don't know how much time had passed before I woke back up.  Not much from the scene.  I was still lying on the floor in a pool of blood.  Tony stood away from the crowd around me.  Davyn and Skylar had worried looked on their faces.  Ant and Ryan looked as calm as could be.

Ant frowned at me when he saw my eyes open, "And what did that prove?"

I smiled as I sat up.  "Nothing.  But it made me feel better."  I stood up and walked out of the room.  I didn't care what happened afterwards.  I didn't care if Tony went crying back to the clan.  I was tired of his attitude.

Outside the room I was surprised to see so many people.  People I hadn't expected to see.  Ryan put his arm around me and in his usual jovial manner whispered to me, "When Il Cane calls so many come."    I don't know if it is out of respect of it is out of fear, but either way I was glad we were not going to finish this war alone.  

Alec and Valentine were in the room with William.  The beach conclave we had found was here in force.  My current herd of humans were joyfully reunited with their friends and family they had left to join me on my journey.  I was thankful everyone was getting this chance.

Dimitiri and the pack were here, and with him he brought more First Therians than I had ever seen.  Granted that wasn't a lot, but it was a wonderful sight to see.

Aurora and Francesco had come back.  When they saw me they hurried over to see me.  Aurora hugged me tightly, "My dear, why did you stab yourself so close to the end?"

I only smiled back at her.  Francesco laughed, "Tony probably aggravated her. He's good at that."  He put his arm around me, "You may not be blood, or even clan, but you are family to me."

I smiled up at him, it meant a lot that he was still seeing me as family.  He really was the only father figure left in my life.  I had killed the only other person who held that status.  I sighed at the memory of that day.  It was not one of my greatest accomplishments despite its results.

I walked through the crowd of people to what appeared to be a stage.  I didn't know why but it felt appropriate to say something.  I was not a leader.  I do not want to be a leader.  But here I am taking the lead on the final assault.  Why?  Because someone has to, they all came in my name.  I had to step up to the call.

I stood with my back to the crowd for several minutes.  I didn't know what I was going to say.  I could feel encouragement from Davyn and Ryan.  And when I turned around all eyes were on me.

"Today marks the first day of the rest of our lives.  What we do from here on out is because we tried.  We may not win, but we aren't going to go down without a fight.  We don't have to kill all our enemies.  We only have to cut off the head of the snakes.  We have already weakened them.  We need to weaken the New Order further.  And to do so we need to reduce Brandon's power threshold.  We take down the rest of the council and then only the head will remain.  

"Evangeline won't be easy to kill.  But with the help of the clan of New Haven, we have a plan to use her own skills against her.  

"Desmond is not a fighter, as he puts it he's a lover.  He is empathy personified.  If you feel it he can manipulate you.  Skylar and I will help you keep Desmond at bay but you must believe in magic.  This magic will only work if you believe it will.  It will be hard for most of us.  But you can do it.  We can beat Desmond.

"Virgil is only a real threat if you are tired.  We will go in and we will take him out after a good rest.  If you even feel slightly tired, do not come.  No one will fault you. we will look highly on your good judgment.  The sacrifice of the one for the many.

"With these three out of the way, only Brandon and his entourage will stand in our way for victory.  It will be the hardest battle and we will lose many friends and family in the battle.  But we will fight on.  We will give our children and their children's children the victory they deserve.  If we don't, someone will follow us.  Someone will free our children from what we fight against.  It will happen, in the end we will win"

A triumphant huzzah rang through the crowd.  I smiled and stepped away from the stage.  Those I passed touched my shoulder or arm.  Davyn stepped up on the stage behind me and I turned around to see what he had to say.  Ryan and Ant stood at my side protecting me from those wishing to chat.

Davyn held open his arms, "All of you are welcome to take part in the grand celebration of our freedom tonight.  Eat, drink, not too much and be merry.  Spend this time with your friends and family and be ready to fight tomorrow."
