# The Unimaginable

It didn't take long to get everyone together and bid farewell to the town hidden in the mountains.  Tony and I were the last to leave.  I helped Thea lay the last of the wards around the town to keep my family safe.  Once I stepped into reality, I knew Valence would come after me.  I wasn't afraid of him, but I was afraid for my family.  And even though I slumbered for the past twelve years, these people were my family.  And I would protect them.

Tony and I were the last to stand inside the circle.  Thea waited to close the barrier.  I looked up at the stars.  I would probably be the last time my life would be this calm for a long time.  Tony put his arm around me.  I wrapped my arms around his waist.  I looked at Thea and then she was gone, I was still in Tony's arms, but the natural scene we were in in had been replaced by concrete and dust.  I buried my face in Tony's chest.  I tried not to cry.

"You are mighty emotional lately."  Tony hugged me tight to him.  I couldn't explain it.  I didn't know why, but he held me anyway.

When I had gathered myself together, Tony unfurled me from his body and we walked down a long corridor.  Men and women smiled and greeted him.  Some saluted him.  He smiled at them.  I felt invisible.  It wasn't until a vampire was walking by that I realized they had all been human.  The vampire stopped ten feet in front of us blocking our way.  He stared at me under Tony's arm.  His jaw dropped.  I looked up at Tony and smiled down at me.  "I knew someone would know you were here soon enough."  The vampire in front of us turned and ran yelling, "Il Cane comes."

Tony laughed, "So much for a quiet entrance."  Tony let go of me but I clung to him.  He looked down at me and wrapped his arm back around me.  "The Hound does not snuggle."

I looked up at him.  He frowned.  "Okay.  We'll keep them away."  You could hear echoes coming from the way the vampire had run.  Tony opened a door.  "We are here anyway.  It was a closet, but we figured you wouldn't mind cramped as long as it was alone and shielded.  Aurora said Alec and Valentine worked a little extra shielding in so you could sleep in peace."  

I walked inside and I was cut off.  I stepped out of the doorway and I could feel everyone again.  Tony smiled, "its okay.  Ryan or I can be with you if you need something to hold onto, but this way until we can save them, you have a place to collect yourself."  I stepped back inside and I nearly tripped over a bundle on the floor.  I picked it up and unrolled it on the bed.  My sword lay shining in the dim light from the oil lamps outside the door.  Two well shined daggers lay in their sheathes beside it.  

I sat down on the bed staring at my weapons.  "Alex said he took care of the sword.  He couldn't take care of the daggers."  I nodded the daggers were sliver plated; to vampires and Therians silver was deadly.  I picked up the sword in its sheath and pulled the hilt from the casing and the ring of the metal was music to my ears.  I closed my eyes and leaned the cold steel against my forehead.  I missed the cold hard steel against my skin.  

A voice from the door chimed in, "She looks like she's going to make love to the sword."

Tony laughed, "She probably would if she could."

The girl giggled and smiled at him with bright flirty eyes.  I watched as she flirted with Tony.  He was being nice and flirting back.  She giggled again, and I went back to my weapons.  I picked up the dagger and pulled its sliver blade from the scarab that held it.  I ran the flat of the blade against my skin.  The smell of burning flesh scented the air.  The girl flirting with Tony yelped and ran to me and pulled the dagger from my hand.  I glared at her and snatched it back.  I growled.

Tony pulled the girl back by her shoulder, "She's okay.  I won't let her hurt herself.  She is just familiarizing herself with the tools of her trade."  She squeaked and then hugged Tony, the hug lingered before she ran out the door.

I ran the sharp blade along my skin.  The small rivulet of blood swelled from the cut.  It didn't heal immediately.  Tony took the blade away as he sat on the bed.

I stared at the blood welling up from the cut.  "Girlfriend?"

He coughed, "That obvious."  He paused and blushed, "She doesn't know who you are. She's human."

"You love her?"  

He put his arm around me, "No."  It was that simple.  My body relaxed into his but I watched the blood run down my arm.  "Are you hungry?" he asked me.

I shook my head.  "Nothing from the blood?" He asked. 

I shook my head again.  "The beast is not here.  Like the nightmares, nothing but you."  I looked up at Tony and he smiled.

Another voice came from the door way.  "Am I interrupting?"  I looked around Tony, to see a man standing there.  He was tall, his head nearly brushed to top of the door way.  "Tony.  Tristan wanted me to get you.  Aurora has something to show HER."  He nodded towards me.

Tony asked, "You okay, you want to do this now?"

I shook my head but got up anyway and started for the door.

"If she isn't ready why is she going?"  the man was confused.  

I walked past him with only three words on my lips, "Honor, Duty, and Obligation."

Tony laughed, "That's why."  We followed the man to Aurora, though I could find her easily, I could feel everything again.  I fought the beast inside me.  I pushed back the nightmares and held on to the man beside me.  

We took a left in the corridor, a right a left and we kept making turns. This place was a maze.  It reminded me of the catacombs in Dangdburgh but man made.  

I grabbed the man's arm, "Why didn't you just bring us from the right?"  He looked at me stunned.

"Wha?"

Tony laughed, "She asked you why you are taking us the long way?"

He stammered, "Be...because the straight path is booby trapped."  

"I looked at Tony, did you do that?"

He shook his head.  "You don't know where we are?"

It was my turn to shake my head.  

"Well I can feel your magic everywhere."

I blinked, "We're in the catacombs below Dangdburgh?"  Tony nodded.

I turned to the right and found the place that was booby trapped.  I nodded, I remembered the trap, the magic here to keep things safe.  I touched the barrier and it fell.  I walked through to the other side and then back to the man standing in awe.  "You can go that way now."  I turned to Tony, "Why didn't anyone take them down, and why are we in the one place they would look."

The man yelped.  Tony smiled, "They do look, but you have many barriers that we don't take down, and they keep us safe from those that would come.  As for not taking them down, no one knows how, or what you did.  Aurora can't see them.  I can feel them, but I can't touch them."  

I looked to the man as he cringed behind Tony.  "When we are done here, show me those that are in the middle of living areas.  I will make it safe.  And then I want you to show me the areas that you need the barriers I will fortify them."  He looked at me like I was an alien. 

"Well Josh, she won't bite you unless you ask."  Tony laughed.

Josh stammered, "Um.  Okay.  I. Guess."

I put my hand on Josh, he yelped.  I took my hand off.  "Will you show me the dangers?"  I asked softly and carefully.  I touched him again.  And he relaxed.

He nodded.  "Sure thing, after Aurora gets her hooks in you."  He said it as if he was more afraid for my life.

"Lead the way Josh."  I patted his back.

Josh led the way to Aurora and when I found her I felt my blood boil.  It wasn't anger; it really felt like my blood was boiling.  I frantically looked around and found what I did not think I would ever say again.  But there they were - horrors unimaginable.  

Aurora sounded panicked, "I didn't do it I swear.  I was just reading."

I asked "Out loud?"

Aurora hung her head.  I spoke words that I did not know what they meant.  The language was long since dead, but it was the power that ran the device that made the room heat vampire blood.

Aurora sank to the floor, she was tired.  She had been fighting the machine for longer than needed.  

Josh ran to her and helped her into a chair.

I tried not to raise my voice, but the fury in it I could not contain. "These were hidden for a reason."

I picked up the book that Aurora had been reading, and words sprang to life on the page.  I turned the book so Aurora could read it.  "Vampire Torture Machine by George Washington".  

Aurora looked up at me.  "How did you do that?"

I shrugged, "I just touched it."

Tony picked up a book but it didn't do anything.  He handed it to me.  I took the leather bound book in my hand and words shown like a mist on the page, "The Origins of Man by Charles Darwin".  I laid the book back down.  "This one you can read.  It is a history of vampires.  Darwin found many disturbing things in his research that he did not share with the world."

Tony picked it up.  And the words solidified so he could read them.  He looked up at me.  "How?"

"I am Keeper of Secrets."  

Aurora looked up at me, "But....",she stopped, "I never tried to read them while I was Keeper."

I nodded, "It is more than just protecting them.  It is being there so that the leaders can use what is needed.  It became what you had were out of necessity.  There are things that if used could not only destroy the user, but magic, or even the world.  There are weapons here that are beyond imagination."

Josh looked over at me.  "I guess you'll be sorting these things out then.  I'll go."

I grabbed his arm.  "This can wait, safety comes first."  I turned to Aurora.  "Do. Not. Touch. Anything. Else."

She nodded and I turned to see Tony smiling wider than he had in the days since he'd woken me.  "What?" I asked him.

"And you say you aren't a leader."  He wrapped his arm around me.  "Josh, lead the way my man.  Take Il Cane to her creations."  He grabbed his arm.  "Be clear on what needs to happen.  Strengthen or Destroy.  Understand me.  Cari is very literal."

He nodded with fear in his eyes.  And we followed him through the underground.
