# The House By The Sea

We arrived at the top of the cliff and the sun was starting to peak its hot head above the horizon.  I stepped into the shadows alone, into the cave the girls had found.  It would be hard to hide from the sunlight, but we had to try.  Only three of us left could manage the sunlight.  Valentine and Alec slept in the dark corner of the cave. Tt really was just an inlet in the mountain carved from the sea on high tide.  Hopefully high tide was not near.  Aurora was hugging Francesco. He was going to help Ryan as Ant was fleeing into the cave with me.  We'd waited too long.

Ant hugged me, "The time difference caught us I think."  I nodded.  "Francesco, Tony and Ryan will bury Mia and Damian and we'll say words tonight, if that will do for you."  I nodded again.  I was tired and hungry.  

I curled up in the other dark corner and the girls came to me.  The other children followed.  Lee and Leyla came and curled up next to me.  Ant sat down next to me.  I smiled, he whispered, "One big happy family with Momma."  I rolled my eyes at him.  He laughed softly, "But it's true."

He was right, this felt right.  It was a family.  Not something I thought I'd ever have, but here it was, in the worst of times.  I closed my eyes and felt Tony working to cover our friends.  Our rag-tag family was as together and that was what mattered.  

A shadow from the coming sun made me open my eyes.  A shadowed figure stood in the doorway, peering into the darkness.  Ant put his hand on mine. He didn't want me to make any moves.  The figure spoke loudly into the darkness.  "I've seen the shadows move before." It was a much older man; his voice was ragged with age.

I hadn't heard the saying in many years, but the reply was automatic, "The sun moves and they follow." 

There was an audible sigh of relief from the man.  "My Isabel would have loved to see you again."

I smiled, "William?"

His shadowed figure nodded.  "When the sun sets you and yours are welcome in our house."

Tony, Ryan and Francesco stood behind the old man, Tony and Francesco drew weapons and I didn't have time to say anything before Ryan stepped between the man and their weapons.  Ryan spoke calmly to the other men, "This is William, husband of Isabel, one of Cari's Lesser Chevalier over the years.  He is a friend."  Ryan hugged the man.  "Is Isabel well?"

The sorrow in William's voice was loud, "She passed two years ago."  

Ryan hugged him again.  "I am sorry for you loss.  I hope you don't mind, but we buried my sister and her husband upon your cliff so they could see the night sky and your beautiful sunsets."

It was William's turn to express his sorry for our loss.  "I'm sorry, I know she will be greatly missed."

I spoke from the shadows, "When night comes will honor your wife and our friend."

He nodded, "I look forward to it.  I will prepare a feast."  He laughed, "Well what comes as a feast these days."

Ryan hugged him again, and William left.  The three men came into the cave and stood guard while the rest of us slept.

I heard them discussing William and Isabel as I drifted to sleep.

I woke when the sun was high in the sky.  I hadn't slept long.  Ryan was sleeping.  Francesco was standing at the entrance.  I did not know where Tony was, but I could feel him safe.  I started to move the children from my body they were using as a pillow.  Francesco turned to see me moving he was in the process of drawing his gun.  I still thought it was funny that the primeval vampires, particularly someone as old as he was using a gun.   He relaxed visibly and came to help me with the children.  

He whispered to me, "You are up early." 

I nodded, "I'm hungry, I won't sleep well until I can eat well."

He nodded, "Tony is hunting."

"What is he hunting?"

Francesco smiled, "Deer I'd assume, orr some other animal.  Most of us can be sustained with traditional means.  The rest of you we'll figure something out.  We don't have many humans here for you lot."

I nodded, "And what we do are too young except for Ryan and he can't feed us all."

Francesco nodded.  "But you drink from other things yes?"

I nodded, "Dimitri will prefer to feed up on the animals as well."

He smiled, "I'd forgotten that part. It wasn't what I meant."

I cocked my head at him in confusion.  He laughed, "Don't act like you don't know what I mean."

"You mean I feed off of your son, literally?"

He nodded, "I don't know why he lets you.  Aurora refuses."

I shrugged, "We've done it for centuries when we have been together."

He nodded, "I know.  And I still find it disturbing that you are not addicted to vampire blood like a human."

"It's our connections I'm sure, but Thea is no longer with us to confirm it."  I looked down.

Francesco put his arm around me.  "We've lost many.  And we will lose more in this war.  But we will win.  They will not have died for nothing."

I leaned in to him and hoped he was right.

Tony returned as the sun was beginning to set.  It was hard staying in the shadows on the west facing caving with the sun setting but there was room for most of us to hide with the help of our less fragile friends.  

The sun had finally set and only a few minor burns were had.  We'd made it through to night.  We were together, and together we moved to through the shadows to the grave site.

Ryan knelt beside the mound of dirt with his nephew in his arms.  "We love you Mia.  Damian.  You will be missed."

I tried not to cry.  It didn't manage well.  I had only one tribute to give to my fallen friends.  I stuck the sacred artifact that the new Wolf King had given me as a token of reward.  Tony laughed.  I slit my wrist and let the blood drain onto the grave.  "My promise to avenge your deaths until my last breath."

We stood in silence.  We stood there several minutes before Ryan had to ask, "What's with the stick?"

Tony laughed again.  "It was her reward for killing the Fat King."  

Ryan laughed.  "She accepted a stick?"

Tony smiled, "She was going to kill him anyway this made it legal by the laws of those who hired her."

Ryan smiled and looked up at me, "And you are giving Mia and Damian your reward.  She would love it."

I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes.  I smiled, I couldn't speak.

Tony took my hand and the girls clung to my legs as we all stood there for a few moments.  Tony stepped away pulling me and the girls with him, "We've a feast to get to."

The house by the sea was small, but it was busy with people.  I blinked in surprise.  I hadn't expected anyone other than William.  A few children saw us coming and yelled, "They are coming", And they ran into the house.  People began to come out of the forest behind the house, torches flickering in the distance.  I stopped.

Tony asked, "What's wrong?"

"I don't know."

William came out of the house helped by the two children who had run inside.   We stayed where I stopped as William came to us.  I could see his big smile even from the distance.  The boys were making sure he did not fall in the sand.  I'd bet anything they were his grandchildren.  I was happy he and Isabel had a good life.

He bowed deeply in front of me.  "I told you, we'd have a feast.  You must be hungry.  Even here by the seashore we've heard of your deeds.  Everyone here wishes to help you in some way.  Whatever way we can."

He looked at me, "I know you won't take more than you need.  But we offer what we have to you and yours.  It's the least we can do."

I was still not sure what was going on.  He smiled, "You've not heard.  General Dilanti has declared you an enemy of the state.

He claims you've killed two of his generals and eternal life is the reward for your death."  He waved his hand at the crowd gathering behind him, "We don't want eternal life of servitude.  There are many other colonies all over that would give you shelter and help.  You only need but to ask."

As if William had commanded the crowd moved towards us, some kneeling most offering a wrist to us.  They were all smiling.

I stepped forward, "I will accept all that offer, but first my friends and the children must be feed.  The children eat real food."

William waved the boys helping him forward.  "Show them to the dinner table."  He looked at Ryan, "I'm sure you are hungry too."

Ryan nodded and picked up Lee and took Leyla's hand.  The five of them walked towards the house, followed by half the women.

Francesco, Aurora, Valentine, Alec fed until they were full and followed their new friends into the house by the sea.  William frowned, "And you kind sir."

I smiled at him, "Tony won't feed until I do.  That's what husbands do, they look out for you."

William laughed and hugged Tony, "So glad to meet the man who could handle this one."  He offered his wrist to Tony.  Tony had no choice but to feed on the frail man.

"I will take what's offered in an orderly fashion."  They lined up, like they'd done this before.  I had only done this once before.  A village was threatened by a rogue vampire and they paid tribute to me this way.  They knew of vampires and some lived among them and showed them the way.  They were thankful I'd helped them.  I didn't know why these people wanted to thank me.  But I wouldn't hurt their feelings.

I drank a small amount from each of them.  I played no favorites.  Tony took a few and got his fill.  He was hungrier than he acted.  By the time the line had dwindled to nothing I was full.  There were many people in this little conclave that were thankful.  A small woman stood in the distance.  When the last was feed upon she came to me, "My father is inside telling tales of Il Cane to the children."

I smiled, "Nothing too scary I hope."

She shook her head, "No.  He only has fond memories of you and yours.  He loved my mother and he loved that she waited for nearly a century to find him."  I smiled.  She took my hand.  "Come, stay with us for the night.  Surely you can spare a moment of time."

"I think we can spare more, but I don't want to risk you all.  They will come for me, for us."  I didn't want to hurt my people.

"Stay for as long as you feel comfortable."  

I bowed to her, "Thank you."
