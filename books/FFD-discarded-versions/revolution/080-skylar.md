#Skylar

When I found Skylar she was crying.  I disliked crying but I offered her a tissue and she took it and looked up at me and burst out in tears even more.

I sat down next to her and she nearly fell over into my lap sobbing.  I patted and rubbed her back as she cried.  I didn't count the minutes until she settled down.  Most people would say I'm not patient, but sometimes you just had to wait, there was nothing you could do.

Skylar looked at me and wiped the last of the tears away, her voice was broken from the crying, "Davyn ended it with me."  She frowned and tears started to flow again.  "I'm sorry, but I blamed you, I told him I knew you'd ruin it for us."  Skylar's face grew red with anger, "He had the nerve to laugh at me and called me a petty fool.  He said you were nothing to him, and he wanted nothing to do with our bonds.  He dismissed me from his services and now I have no where to go."

I smiled, Skylar tried to run away, she must have thought I was mocking her but I caught her arm, "You have someplace to go.  You are the mother of Ryan's child.  You will always be welcome with us, Skylar."

She turned back at me and looked at me confused, "We lost the child when he severed the magic."

I sighed, "Either way, you are part of our family.  Children are lost, but bonds like that can't be broken."

She glared at me, "What would you know of it?  You break everything you touch."  Skylar fell to her knees in frustration and began crying again.  She sobbed, "I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that."

I rubbed her hands, "It's okay.  You are family.  Jesse's clan banished him because he wanted to have a Caestus.  Henry left his clan because he didn't believe they were right.  Nicola is like a daughter to me.  All three are family and they have no direct time to my blood line.  They are family."  I stood up and took Skylar's hands  and pulled her up.  "Family is stronger than clan.  It is not about blood, it is thicker than that."

Skylar looked across at me with large wondrous eyes, "I never thought of you having such a large heart."

I smiled, "I'm full of surprises."

Skylar laughed and wiped the tears away again.  "We hardly know each other, yet you'd take me in?"

I nodded, "I can't explain it, but it's the right thing to do.  Davyn has lost a lot, you on the other hand have gained an entire family who will not desert you, even if they disagree with you."

Skylar turned around and saw Tony watching.  She hurridly wiped away the tears and tried to make herself presentable.  He smiled at us, "I take that's meant for me too."

I smiled.  Skylar looked back at me, "He's the reason Davyn is pissed off at you."

I nodded, "Davyn wanted something I could not give him, something you couldn't give him.  Tony made him realize it and he broke the bonds."

Skylar frowned, "He broke your's too?"

Tony smiled, "Yeah, it wasn't a pretty scene when she felt it.  But it coincided rather well I think."

I shook my head, "You would think so."

He laughed, "You thought so at the time too."  He wrapped his arms around us.  "Skylar, she'll protect you forever or for as long as you want to be part of it.  She'll love you even if you hate her.  Davyn isn't worth crying over."  Tony kissed the top of her head and pecked me on the cheek.  "I hate to be the bearer of pushiness, but we need those crystals.  Skylar, can you do them with out Cari?"

Skylar laughed, "And she's supposed to be the poignant one."  She sighed in mock frustration, "Yeah, it would go faster with her though."

I asked, "Why?"

Tony smiled as he took a necklace from out of his pocket,  and put it around Skylar's neck.  "We need you to make these?"

I nodded and smiled as Tony took the necklace off Skylar and she reappeared.  She giggled, "Did I really disappear?"

Tony smiled.  "Yes, you did, we want to make more.  Aurora says we can all pitch in but our best fighters need you to make theirs.  And I want one of yours, far better than my measly shadow."

I started to ask what we were going to make the necklaces out of but tony handed me a bunch of small chains they found in the jewelry shop around the corner.  "Will this do?"

I laughed, "Yes."  I kissed him and it took us both all of our will power to pull away from one another.

Skylar and I worked as quickly at our projected tasks.  Skylar worked on the crystals for the humans. I doubted they had the will power to maintain their emotions with Desmond.  These crystals would absorb the power directed at them.  Hopefully it would be enough.  

I worked on the necklaces with the help of Aurora and Ant.  Tony decided he wasn't strong enough to work more than the few he had.  I was very interested in this part of the plan.

We worked for what seemed like hours, and we hoped we had made enough for all of the humans going with us.  This was the last battle. We needed everyone doing their part.
