# Joining The Family

Donatello held his hand out to me.  "Come child.  Let us speak alone, away from the prying ears of your men."

The term made me slightly unease.  Donatello noticed my ill-ease, "I meant your followers.  I did not mean to bring something up that is best forgotten."

We walked away from everyone. I could feel Tony watching me as I went with his grandfather.  He was sending me luck through our connections.  I sent reassurance back.  I'd be fine.  "What do you know of what should stay forgotten?"

Donatello opened a door in a tree.  I blinked and looked again.  The shadow veil was strong here and it took a second look to see the building that stood here and not the tree.  Donatello smiled.  "Shadow is strongest, yes?"

"Yes."  I nodded and walked into the open door. Donatello followed and took a chair by the table. 

"Come sit with me."  He smiled, "As your question.  I know nothing of your situation, just the feeling you gave when I said your men.  But since it's here, perhaps you can shed light.  I do not want to offend your fellows."

I told Donatello of Tristan's betrayal and the damage he did to our relationships.

He smiled, "But there must be at least one good thing came of it?"

I nodded, "I learned what two sided love should be."

"See, the silver lining."  He patted my hand.  "I pulled you aside so that I may speak with you upon Clan matters, most importantly the joining of your Clan and ours."

"My clan?"

'Your lot, your friends, your family."  I nodded.  He continued, "I sensed many connections.  I fear my son and the others will not be honest.  But you will be, I hear it is your nature."

I nodded, "Only Dimitri is not officially tied to anyone in your family, of those that came with us anyway.  Francesco and Aurora married about 5 years ago.  I assume that means they mated.  Henry and Nicola mated in the very recent past.   Ryan is Ant's Chevalier.  Oh and the children.  Leyla and Lee are Therian's.  Lee is Ryan's sister, Mia and Damian's adopted son.  Sadly they passed in the war.  The rest of the humans are my lesser Chevalier."

Donatello nodded, "Il Mandria di Cane.  How can we bring Dimitri into the family?"

I smiled, "You should ask him if he wants to.  He is Animal Ken.  He isn't vampire or human friendly in most cases."

"He follows you."

"Dimitri is my friend and one of my sires."

"Oh, that's different, he's family.  Who else sired you?"  He was full of questions.

"Aurora, Damian, and Dimitri, two others on our side, Alec and Valentine, and five on the other side of this war.  I've killed one, Salvador.  I intend to kill Nate, Evangeline, Desmond and Virgil."

"We never knew the full extent to your council.  It is good to know that they had a split as our Elders did."

I sighed, "I am not Elder."

He chuckled, "You are Elder.  You are one of the most power vampires I have ever known.  You rival myself and you are stronger than my son."

"And that means?"

"Nothing my dear, just you will be respected among our people and your opinion matters, and if you desire, a voice in all matters that will be heard.  You are not the politician.  I know that, but you are strong.  You are Elder."

I nodded.  "You realize I will kill your other son."

He looked away.  "I didn't know that was common knowledge."

"Francesco claimed him his brother once upon a time."

He tapped his fingers on the table, "Ah.  Yes I do know that.  I will help you.  I should have done it when he turned Embraced his first vampire."

I had to ask, "Would you kill any of your vampires who embraced a human?"

"No, but we should."

"I wouldn't be so hasty in that decision.  When I went rogue I killed a whole village.  Francesco and Tony found me and pulled me back from the brink of my own destruction.  One girl from the village clung to life.  She was about to die.  Francesco embraced her.  Nicola came with me and Tony and I took her as mine, even though I did not sire her.  I trained her.  She is forbidden by your culture, but Nicola is a sweet girl.  She refuses to drink blood from a human.  She will only drink from a cup.  It is because of what I did to her village."

Donatello thought about it.  "I see your point.  We all do things we regret, but sometimes things have a purpose."

I nodded and closed my eyes.  "I need to feed."

He stood up and walked me to the door.  "My child, we will join you to us after you've feed." Donatello whispered to me as I walked out of the door, "Do not feed on my grandson before the ceremony, it will taint the magic."

I nodded.  "I know."

He grabbed my arm, "How do you know?"

I smiled, "I know much about your blood line."

Aurora walked up behind me with a smile.  "She is a true Keeper of Secrets sir.  She knows much about many things.  But I've been sent to tell you we are ready."

I looked at Aurora, "I need to feed."

She looked back at me, "Make it fast I don't think they will be patient."

I rolled my eyes and nodded.  "Fine."

I bowed to Donatello and followed my connection to Tony to find someone to feed on.  I knew they wouldn't be far from Tony.  We had yet to establish a schedule, Sam volunteered to be first.  I graciously accepted.  I bit into his wrist and he shuddered, I pulled back on the bit and he eased into a calming pleasure.  He smiled stupidly. I suspect he looked like someone high on drugs.

As I withdrew robed figures can out of another tree and formed a circle around a fire.  They were blessing the fire.  Tony grabbed my hand and held tightly on to it.  I squeezed it back.  I'm not sure who was more afraid of this, he or I.

Donatello dropped his hood and motioned for Tony and I to come stand in front of him.  "Today we join Il Cane and Antonio Giovanni and welcome them into the clan.  Once joined, their family becomes ours.  We become blood.  We are Clan."

Donatello put his hand top of our heads.  I felt the death magic of vampirism.  Such a stupid name now that I thought about our origins.  I felt the magic flow into our bodies.  It was an odd feeling it from both sides.  Tony and I stared at each other in pure amazement.  A strange glow rose above our bodies.  Donatello tied the glows and dropped his hands and the streams sprang into place inside us.  We had mated before, but this was different.  "Together they are bound."  He waved called forth Ant and the girls.  "And in these three children of their blood, their marriage has been consummated."  The old man stretched his arms out to include all of the family, "And the  rest join us through blood of their blood."  

The crowd chanted in unison, "We are Clan"
