# In The End

The battle raged on but I was stuck in a moment in time.  Tony had saved my life and if we didn't move quickly the silver bullet to his brain could mean a very serious injury he would never recover from.  

I picked up Tony and Ryan and found the nearest shadow to go to our rendezvous point.  I could only hope that we'd have a doctor of some sort there.  I was still in shock when we appeared in the mist of our allies.  They cheered and yelled as the enemy was fleeing.  They had felt the loss of their commander.  

From the middle of the crowd a familiar voice echoed in my head.  "Cari, I never thought I'd see you again."  Eve laughed, "But then again you are more resilient that I had ever thought."  She took Tony from my dead mans carry and laid him on the ground.  She immediately went to work.  I don't think I was more happy to see anyone else at that moment.  

Ryan roused and I gave him a hug.  He stared at me in confusion until he saw Tony lying next to him.  He sighed and hugged me back.  "It'll be okay, Doc is here now.  She'll take care of him."

And she did.  Tony should make a full recovery if he ever wakes up.

This beloved country would never be the same.  Vampires were common knowledge know, there was no going back.  The state of our world was in shambles and it would be years before the good ole U S of A would be back up to it's prior existence, if it ever managed that.  For now we go on living with what our life brings.  We can only hope that it will lead to a better tomorrow.
