It was the early morning on the second of September almost nine hundred and three years after my birth.  The year was 2001, it was a year full of earthquakes, new presidents, space adventures and executions, and the year was not over yet.  A thunderstorm billowed on the New York City horizon as if it were foreshadowing some great doom to plague the land. It was a beautiful sight; my pale reflection was the only thing marring the view in the plate glass window.  

Nick Shaffer, our contact and currently my lover walked up behind me and wrapped his arms around me, kissed my shoulder and whispered in my ear, "When you coming back to bed?"

Muttering to myself, "We've been here too long."  The storm on the horizon seemed more like a personal warning than it did anything of major proportion.  Superstitions in my family ran high. The Big Apple was a fine city but we had been here too long.  Staying in one place was rare for me, but this time there was Nick.  Nick's past wasn't one of great importance, but he was an addict.  Not only had he gotten himself hooked on drugs and alcohol, but his latest addiction was an addiction no human could ever think to break him of, he had been addicted to vampire blood.  

In history humans who drank vampire blood for any length of time became what we called a ghoul - man who thirsted for vampire blood would make him do anything and everything possible for one more drop of our precious blood.  Vampires use to slaughter ghouls on sight, until we found a better way to return them to society.  Withdrawal was hard, but if done properly could be done for life.  My family and I had remained in the big city to finish weaning Nick off of vampire blood.  It had been done for nearly a month and yet we had stayed.  We had nowhere else to be, so our roots began to sink in with very little effort on our part.

Nick ran his fingers playfully down his fingers over the scar that ran from my left shoulder blade down my back to my right buttock check.  "That wasn't what I asked."  Nick sang playfully in my ear, "When you coming back to bed?"  

A knock sounded before I could respond to Nicks tender touch. Ryan called out, "Cari, you have a phone call.  It's important."

I could feel Nick's sigh against my cheek as I answered, "Come in."

Nick hurried to the bed and climbed in, he was still shy about his nudity.  Ryan opened the door and quickly shut it when he saw I was standing there in the buff.  He didn't blush; he had after all seen me naked many times before.  He grinned at Nick; I could feel his glee in embarrassing Nick radiate through our bond.  I shook my head, "Who is it?"

Ryan pressed a button on the phone and spoke into the air, "Aurora, Cari is here."

On the other side of the phone it was easy to recognize the soft, silky voice that was Aurora Dejesus, one of the council members in Europe, "Cari don't come when Sal calls."

Before I could ask "What?" the phone was dead.  Ryan looked down at me with confusion, it was a very weird call.  

Ryan frowned, "She said she was in Dangdburgh.  Why is she here?"

Another knock came from the door; Allison did not wait to be let in.  She came in with a phone to her ear, "Yes Sal, I'm in the same room as she is now.  But it hardly matters."

Sal's voice was loud and clear despite not being on speaker phone, one of the perks of being a vampire.  "We have a job.  I need her here in Dangdburgh. Immediately!"  He sounded anxious.

Allison nodded, "Yes sir.  We will be there in about a day, and that's traveling around the clock."

Sal muttered something to someone on the other side.  It wasn't intelligible, like he knew I was listening.  "Fine!  Just get her here soon, it's important!"  Allison hung up the phone without even so much as a good-bye.  But Sal could go on for hours impressing upon us how important it was that we be there, thusly delaying our departure.

Ryan looked at me with concern, "You going?"

Allison looked at Ryan with confusion, "Why wouldn't she?"

He smiled at her but the light was not there when he did, "Aurora told Cari not to come when Sal called."

Allison stared at me, it was odd to get conflicting orders, something bad was on the horizon, and the thunderstorm on its way in to the city was far from the worst of it, I could feel it in my bones.

Nick laughed from the bed he was hiding in, "She'll go.  Honor, Duty and Obligation demand it."

Ryan laughed with him.  Allison blushed when she realized Nick was lying naked in my bed.  She stammered an apology, "I'm sorry, I didn't realize.  I'll go start packing."  I rolled my eyes; she was still relatively new to our family, though some would say twenty years is plenty long.

Ryan gave me a kiss on the check, "I hope you know what you are doing."  And then he too left.

I muttered to myself, "I hope so too."  

The sheets from the bed flew off and Nick was hastily getting dressed, "I suppose I'll go now, since you are leaving."  He looked up at me with a fear on his face, "When will I see you again?"

I sat behind him on the bed where he pulled his pants on and wrapped my arms around his chest and whispered in his ear, "I don't know, but you don't need me anymore."  Though it was probably a lie, I feared he'd traded his blood addiction for another - me.  "But I'm sure we'll see each other again, I don't know when but we will."  Nick rubbed his face against my cheek then finished getting dressed.
