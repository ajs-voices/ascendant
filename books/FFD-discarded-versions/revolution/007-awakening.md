# Awakening

Voices above me were familiar but I couldn't hear them.  I felt hands on my shoulders.  I screamed and fought the hands that touched me.  Someone pinned me to the padding.  I could feel someone's breath on my neck.  He.  Yes it was a he, he whispered in my ear.  "Calm down.  It's okay.  Deep breath."  My mind wanted to relax, but the dreams were still running through my mind.  I opened my eyes to see a fall of dark hair blocking my view.  The scent of the man holding me was familiar, it was almost calming.  But even though my eyes were open I could see the nightmares.  I fought against the man holding me.  He held me down, but he was no longer leaning in to me.  I heard him, "Something's wrong.  How long has she been like this."

A woman behind the man spoke softly, "We've heard her screams nearly since she got here."

He turned to her letting go of my shoulders.  I jolted and scrambled out of the coffin.  Why was I in a coffin?  The man turned to catch me but he missed, "And how long has she been here?"

"Almost twelve years."  Her voice was tinged with fear.

Anger crackled in his voice, but he didn't yell, "Why didn't you get her out?"

I watched them through the fall of my own dark hair in the corner.

She stepped up to the man with no more fear, "For one I could not lift the lid."  She put her hands on her hips and tapped her foot impatiently, "And second, she ordered us to leave her in for ten years and then come find you.  That is exactly what we did."

He looked over at me and then back at the woman.  "So you follow her? Blindly?"

She smiled, "No different than you or her own Chevalier.  My family has been entrusted with her care.  I trust her to know the consequences of her actions and my lack of them considering the circumstances."

Another man in the doorway laughed, "I remember this."  He looked over at me cringing in the corner.  "It wasn't supposed to do that though."

The first man looked over at the other, "What is it?"

The second man's grin grew wider, "It's a capsule to keep Cari safe when she slept.  It's meant to hide her, and it did its job.  Until this moment I couldn't pin point her, now I feel her.  She lost her control.  She's afraid.  I'm surprised you can breathe with the thickness of her powers in the room.  I can't feel them out here.  She shielded the room.  Precautions on top of precautions.  I don't think she intended this to happen."  He waved his hand at me and I scurried back into the wall, but there was nowhere else to go.

A small woman brushed passed the second man in the door way.  She walked towards me.  I tried to bury myself in the wall but I fell through.  I landed on my back startled.  I was in the darkness outside the room.  How?

I heard voices coming from every direction.  I didn't have any time before three men were surrounding me.  I looked up at them in amazement.  The men above me were not smiling except one and his grin was as wide as the moon above.  He knelt down at my head.  "You've never been able to do that before."  He reached out for me and I whimpered.  "It's okay.  I'm just going to help you stand."  He held out his hand and waited.

I studied his upside down face.  I could feel memories tugging at me through the nightmares.  The face was always there in my memories.  A man from behind the ring around me spoke, "She's trying to place you, Ryan."

Ryan... "Ryan Elliott," my voice was hoarse still, my throat felt raw, saying his name out loud unclouded memories.  I knew who he was.  I knew the man who had tried to hold me down as well.  I looked up at him towering above me on my back.  The strongest memory flooded my mind.  "T O N Y".  I smiled.  A vision of a little boy stood in my mind next to the grown man next to me.  He smiled.  And I took Ryan's hand.  He pulled me up but I stumbled and fell.  My legs were weak.  

Tony caught me and scooped me up in his arms, my body quaked in his arms but I melted into him.  I felt whole for the first time since I went to sleep.  The men took me to a small hut just the other side of where I fell through the wall.  My mind was fuzzy and I believed Ryan when he said I'd never done that before, though I couldn't remember what I had done.

The other man who had stood above me smiled at me as we walked through the door way.  "I'm David. David West.  I found your boys here."  He smiled at me with his bright green eyes.  A different kind of power radiated off of him.  I didn't know what it was but it felt primal but not.  Once we were in the room, Tony sat me down in a chair.  

Tony motioned for the man who had helped me recall Ryan's name to come over.  The man smiled, Tony introduced him.  "This is my friend Tristan Marshall, he's an empath and he seems to read you like a book."

He held out his hand, but I didn't take it.  But he smiled, "She's a bit lost.  I take it this isn't normal."

Tony laughed; it was a golden sound to my ears.  "Not even close."

Tristan's smile turned to concern, "She's in a lot of pain."

Tony frowned and it saddened my heart, "She always is."

Tristan took a step back, "Seriously, this is a shit ton of pain.  You can read me right."  Then he took a second look at Tony, "Wait, why can't you tell yourself?"

Ryan answered before Tony could.  "Apparently the only blocks still intact are the ones connected to the lot of us."

I watched and listened to them talk about me like I wasn't there.  But Ryan's words were like a knife cutting through my mind.  The nightmares became real again, the pain made me scream out.  I wanted to say something, but I couldn't make the words come out.  All I could do was scream.  I grabbed Tristan's arm and he fell away from me with a pained look on his face.

Tony pried my grip from Tristan's arm.  Tristan moved closer and grabbed me and pulled me off the chair into his lap and wrapped his arms around me and pulled me as close to his body as he could.  He wrapped me in calmness.  I could feel him trying to comfort me.  

Tony look a moment to process and he put his arms around me and Tristan, more calmness seeped into my body.  I could feel Tristan's heartbeat, it pulsed against me.   It was alluring.  I was hungry.  I tried to pull away from them, struggled to get away from them.  But they pulled and pushed at me, their bodies pressing against me as I fought them.  Tristan's heart was the only thing I could hear, my own pulse beat with his.  I pushed at Tristan, he had to get away from me.  A stab to my chest, or rather that's what it felt like pushed my hunger over the edge.  I thought I was going to bite into the pulse of the large vein that had been there only moments ago, but instead I sank my fangs into a wrist.  I knew the moment I tasted the cooper liquid that Tony had anticipated my move.  I drank his life blood, his living vampire blood raced through me.  I drank for what seemed like forever.

I withdrew from Tony's wrist with blood on my lips.  I felt more myself with his blood coursing through my veins.  I looked over at the man who had tried to calm me.  He smiled at me without any fear in his eyes.  I smiled back.  He asked me, "Can you tell them now?"

I only nodded, afraid to speak.  I got up and eased myself back into the chair.  My strength was returning now after I'd fed, my legs no longer felt weak.  

I started to speak,  but only a squeak came out.  Tristan smiled harder at me encouragingly.  I tried again.  My voice was gravelly but soft, and the words came out in a croak, "Where is everyone else?"

Tony asked, "Who?"  Before I could answer he quickly added, "Oh, you mean your family, your friends, the ones you left at Frozen?"  He sounded angry, angry at me.  I was confused.  He spoke in an abrupt voice, "They're dead!"  He got up and stalked out of the room.

I tried to grab for his arm, but he was too fast, or I was too slow, either way he was gone before he could hear my ask, "Are you sure?"

"They were captured; we assumed them dead when we couldn't find them."  That was Ryan from the back of the room, "Only Mia and myself are left."

I looked around to see Mia sitting at Ryan's left.  She smiled at me and then left the room.  She made herself busy, I could feel her happily moving through the hut we were in.  I could feel Ryan.  I opened myself to Tony and I knew he was sulking out in the woods.  I searched for the others, and I found them.  They were hiding in plain sight, in my nightmares.  I could feel their ragged bodies hanging.  I could feel their weak pulses.  I spoke slowly and carefully so my voice didn't squeak again, "They aren't dead.  They are being tortured.  Not one of them is dead."  I sank into the chair their pain was raw in my body.  I could feel their pain.  It had been their pain that had ravaged my body while I slept.

Ryan got up out of his chair, but Tristan was there first.  "She's right; I saw them in my mind when she grabbed me.  I don't know where they are, but they are alive."  Tristan put his hand on my arm.  "It's okay we'll find them."

Ryan shook his head, "She won't be able to wait until then if we can't get her shield back up.  Whatever is happening has broken her shields."  

A woman who had been in the background the whole time, the woman who was first with me when I woke up, she spoke softly, "I can help her.  I've been taught how to help her."

Ryan looked at her, "Thea are you sure?  You've never done this before have you."

She smiled at him, "I did when she got here."  She laid her hands on me and I could feel the shields rebuilding in my mind.  The pain subsided with each brick she laid.  "It won't be as strong until she can re-forge the link with her friends, but she should be stable."  There was no doubt in her voice.  I felt better too.
