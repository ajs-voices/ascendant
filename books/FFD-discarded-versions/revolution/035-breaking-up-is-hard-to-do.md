# Breaking Up Is Hard To Do

I turned to Tony, "You take the traitor and I'll take the girls someplace safe."  I stepped on my tip toes and kissed him.  I wanted to melt into him, but we had more important things to do - like killing this bastard.

I took the girls and searched for Mia.  Tony took Tristan to the room where we had tortured Johnny a few weeks ago, or was that all it felt like to me.  It has been more than nine months ago.  I sighed at all the lost time.  But what is time to a vampire?

I found Mia preparing for dinner with Damian, probably the wrong people to hand off the girls too.  I hugged Mia, "I'm sorry, they will sleep for a few hours.  And then I'll be back to get them I promise, as soon as I take care of this."  

Damian walked into the room with a stunned smile on his face.  I smiled at him, "I'm leaving but can you please watch the girls.  They will sleep for the next few hours."

Damian looked at me sternly, "What is going on?"

"We have a traitor in our mist and Tony and I are going to take care of him.  I need someone to watch the girls."  It was the truth, without giving away too much.

Mia smiled, "She doesn't want to say more."

Damian nodded, "I know."  He looked at Mia, "We can watch them, and it might be good practice." 

I blinked at them with surprise.  He smiled, "We are discussing the possibility of adoption."

I smiled and hugged Damian and then Mia, "Thank you.  I will return soon."  And with that I left.

I found Alec and Valentine with what I'd pretty much deemed the new council.  It would have consisted of Tristan and Tony, as well but they were disposed of at the moment.

They were discussing some battle plan or another.  Aurora looked up at me and smiled, "We figured the three of you would be playing house right about now."

I didn't know what to say about that.  "We have a situation.  I need Alec and Valentine."

Francesco stared at me, "And you won't tell us why?"

I shook my head, "You'll try to stop me." I frowned, "Though if things go wrong, Ant, will you take care of the girls?"

Ant looked at me with sad eyes, "Of course, but this can't be good if you are making preparations.  Cari, tell us what's going on.  We promise not to stop you."  

Ryan chimed in, "It'll be easier to explain if we know what really happened."

I sighed, "Okay.  Tristan is a traitor."  The room rose to an incoherent crescendo. I glared at the room, "Shut UP"

They room quieted abruptly.  "Valence was controlling Tristan, and I believe Tristan is at least a lesser chevalier to Valence.  We can't kill him because it'll kill me, Tony, Ryan and Mia.  That's too many you all rely on.  I would gladly sacrifice myself to take him out to keep my family safe.  But I can't do that, so I'm going to make Tristan do it, which is why I need Alec and Valentine."  I raised my voice, "I know I can make Tristan break his own bonds killing him."  And then there was silence.

Francesco spoke first, "But he's Chevalier.  The bond can't be broken."

I smiled, "That is true if you want to survive the break.  One must die, the one who breaks the bond will perish.  There is nothing you can do to stop it.  That is why a bond is never broken.  Being Keeper of Secrets has its advantages and disadvantages."  I glared at Aurora for messing up before, which reminded me we still needed to go through all those things.

Alec smiled, "So you want to dominate him."  

Valentine continued in her silky voice, "Through a telepathic link."

I nodded, "Playing Valence's own games against him.  If they are Chevalier then Valence will be dead too."  I paused, "So Ant I need you to take care of the girls if this fails.  Ryan I am sorry for your untimely demise, and Mia's.  And someone needs to tell Damian, I'm sorry."

Marie asked from the corner, "Does Tony know what you plan to do?"

I nodded, "Yes ma'am, he does.  He'll be with me.  I need his strength.  I can't be alone with Tristan again, or I might not make it through the process."  Marie nodded.

Alec and Valentine got up, "Lead the way."

"Tony took him to where we tortured Johnny."  I hoped this would go well.  I prayed to the unknown, that it would go well.  I gave everything to the earth and moon and sun and all things that this would go well.  But I couldn't doubt myself.  I had to do this.  And I had to do it right

We found ourselves in the little room.  Alec and Valentine made the room a sanctuary.  A place where no magic got in and nothing got out.   We hoped it would help protect everyone.

Tony stared at Tristan.  I put my arms around Tony and laid my head on his chest.  "It's best if he's sleeping.  I know you want answers."  

Tony turned around in my embrace and held me tightly too his chest.  "I feel like a complete fool."

I hugged him tight, "Me too."

Alec asked softly, "What do you need us to do?"

I pulled away from Tony so I could see them.  "I need you to touch me and open yourselves to me so I can take what I need."  They nodded and followed their instructions.  I looked up at Tony, "Just be you."  I smiled.  And I put my head on Tony and closed my eyes.  I took a deep breath and I used Valentine's power to cross the chasm between my consciousness and Tristan's.  I found it relatively easily.  I tied an anchor of sorts off so I could get back to myself when I was done.  I walled off Tristan from everyone else including myself, but I pulled my bonds through me, to Tristan.  I could feel Ryan, Mia and Tony inside of Tristan.  

Everything was working fine.  I could feel Tristan starting to wake up and resist me.  I had to work quickly.  I grabbed all the bonds and I pulled them into Tristan.  I pulled mine through me and I pulled Tristan's into his mind.  I could feel them stretching in my hands.  I could see them thinning.  There was not enough strength in the bonds, if they snapped we'd all die.  I gave them a little strength of my own and I gave one last sharp pull and they popped free.

I felt free.  I felt empty.  And then I felt nothing.
