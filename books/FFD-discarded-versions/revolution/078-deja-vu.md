#Deja Vu

Jake looked at the two of us, he almost leered at Tony, he had very little room for me his sexual preferences, if any at all.  

Tony smiled, "He was right though."

Jake nodded, "You love her don't you?  You see it now, you know it?"

Tony laughed, "Just don't tell her okay, she'll smack me around a bit for not realizing it sooner."

Jake laughed too, "I won't even hint at it."  He looked at me with concern, "How are you going to fix this?"

Tony frowned and looked down at me, "Something you'd rather not be here for."

"You're going to have sex with her."

Tony defended his actions, "Not intentionally, but yes more than likely it would end up there."

Jake put his hand on Tony's arm, "Can I watch?"

Tony raised an eye brow, "I didn't think you'd be interested."

Jake turned three shades of red but he didn't say anything.

Tony nodded, "It's not going to be pretty at first and you probably won't like what I have to do."

Jake nodded and he bit my arm to show Tony he understood.  Tony laughed, "Not yet."

And then their attention was both on me, as if I were some main course at a fine dinner.  But it wasn't dinner, and it wasn't sex.  Tony opened himself to me.  I felt his power.  I could feel his heart beating with mine.  I could feel his secrets as if they were my own.  He opened the flood gates but the only thing Tony concentrated on was loving me.  Not loving the person I could be, or the person he wanted me to be.  He showed me the person he saw me as.  The person he wanted me to be and it was no different than what I was.  He had finally come to accept me for who and what I was, in all my so called glory.  He loved me.  A tear streamed down my cheek and Tony kissed it away as he whispered to me, "I didn't think that would work."

I smiled with my eyes still closed, "Jake helped us."  I could feel his hand at the small of my back.  

Jake leaned in to my and I could feel he was eager for something else.  He pushed his body against my back side and he whispered to the two of us.  "I dreamt of this."

Tony took a step back but I pulled him back to me.  "Jake, do you want to go here?"

He pushed himself against me through his jeans, "I never thought I would want to, but yes."

Tony kissed Jake over my shoulder and in a tangle of hands and arms our clothes came off.  We relived the night with Tristan except with Jake.  It's not fair to compare the two but Jake was far better than Tristan could ever have dreamed of being.  

When it was all said and done, Jake whispered in my ear, "That was better than I dreamt it.  But I don't think I can do it again.  No offense."  Jake bit my ear and I bit back a moan of pleasure. 

I leaned up on my elbows, "That's okay Jake.  We can share him separately."

Tony pulled us apart.  "What was that?"  He smiled at us fondly.

"He just said he couldn't do that again."  Jake blushed.  I put my hand on his knee, "Really it's okay.  You can take him to your own bed without me.  I won't mind."

Tony pushed me away and pulled Jake in close and I watched as they made love.  It was far sweeter than any female male courtship I had ever watched before.  Tony did feel for this man, and I wasn't going to be the one to get in the way.

Jake blushed when he realized I was still here.  I shook my head as I pulled the last of my clothes on.  I was surprised they had survived.

Tony laughed, "Jake, she's not bothered by it."  I looked at Jake trying to figure out what he was embarrassed about.  Tony grinned at me, "He's afraid you will dislike him for wanting to fuck me not make love to me."

I smiled and Tony laughed, "She would have rather watched that."

Jake didn't waste time in a blur of movement he pulled Tony around and pushed himself inside Tony.  Tony bit back a yelp of displeasure.  I could feel his pain, but it turned quickly to pleasure and Jake ravaged his body.  I could feel Jake's power wafting over Tony.  It was filling the room.  I watched as his body started to bend and break in places a human body should not.  I put my hand on Jakes back and leaned in to him.  "Don't focus on the anger, the force.  Focus on the pleasure."

Jake huffed as he spoke, "If I do I'll come too fast."

"Trust me.  Don't focus on you, focus on him.  You're an empath.  Fuck him, but don't let the beast control you."  I put my hand on top of Jake's and dug his finger nails into Tony's back.  "Don't let the beast tame you, tame the beast.  Give that energy someplace to go.  Tony will survive it and he will enjoy it.  Fuck him.  Don't let the beast fuck you and make you give up your pleasure."

Tony gasped for air as Jake brought them both.  They collapsed in a writhing mass of sexual tension that I wasn't even aware was here.

Tony pushed Jake off the top of him and he looked up at me with a sex hazed look and smiled, "Thank you."

Jake put his head on Tony's chest and looked up at me with pride, "Yes, thank you.  I would have turned."

Tony patted Jakes back, "I wouldn't have minded."

I fought back an image but Tony shared it anyway in my mind.  The memory of Jake's furry body inside of him.  I shuddered with pleasure.

Jake asked, "What are you doing to her?"

Tony laughed, "Sharing with her." Jake blushed.  "She is far more willing for you to do that to her than you'll ever know.  But we all know you don't swing that way.  Cari will survive with my memories."

Jake blushed harder, "Does she ever get embarrassed?"

Tony shook his head, "Not that I'm aware of, not when it comes to sex anyway."

I tossed them their clothes, "Davyn will be back sometime.  Get dressed, we have things to do anyway."
