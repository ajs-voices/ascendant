# The New Plan

There was always planning to do.  We did after all still have a problem with Brandon and the remainder of the council.  I did not look forward to killing my sires.  Brandon on the other hand I wish would happen sooner, but then again I didn't.  Life was going to change dramatically for all vampires when Brandon was dealt with.  Humans know for sure that vampires exist, the other supernatural creatures doing their best to stay out of the lime light.  I didn't blame them one bit.  But I hoped that some would help fight this fight.

But the first plan I wanted to know about was our new so called living arrangements.  Ant and Ryan had floor plans laid out on a makeshift table.  They were going over the last bits of information with the construction crew they had hired.  Ryan smiled up at me, "We've got you a big room in the center of the building and the vampires spreading out from there.  The rest of us are all on the outer edges to keep you safe.  New Haven has a great security company and with your wards and the like we shouldn't ever be snuck up on ever."

Ant nodded, "We'll make this place a fortress if we get the chance.  Life is going to be different, even here in New Haven when this is all said and done."  

I agreed with him, "You took the words right out of my mouth."

We discussed a few mundane things before Ant dismissed the crew so they could finish their work.  Ant looked up at me, "And for the final blow?"

I nodded.

Ant rolled up the floor plan.  Underneath it was a map of the country.   "Intel says that Evangeline is closest to this location."  He put a red pin in the location.  "Desmond is over here.  And Virgil is way over there."

Ryan took a pen and drew a circle around a large area.  "Brandon is here somewhere we've yet to find the exact location.  Maybe one of those three will have it."

I nodded.  "Evangeline, Desmond and Virgil, in that order.  We need have more than us to take them out."

Jesse nodded, "I spoke with Dimitri while you were out of it.  His pack is in.  They can help with Virgil.  The Giovanni clan," Jesse sighed at the loss of his own clan status, "said they could help take out Desmond.  No one wants to take on the Mistress of Death herself, but I think you can persuade your new man into helping us out."

Ant added, "And if everything goes well with Evangeline, maybe more will come to our side."

I sighed, "So we have to take on Evangeline on our own.  What's her place look like?"

Ryan pulled out a series of photos and a mockup of the lay of the land.  "It's rough, but this is the best we can do with technology out of the picture at the moment."  There was a pretty sophisticated security system laid out - only the best for the New Order.  "Heat sensors, motion sensors, and knowing Evangeline death traps and many wards."

"I can take care of most of Evangeline's tricks.  But if I do I'll alert her to our presence."

From the doorway Davyn spoke, "I didn't know we were planning."

Ant laughed, "You don't know Cari very well."

Davyn chuckled, "I still can't get over you calling your mother by her first name."

I rolled my eyes, "He's almost 800 years old. He's earned the place many centuries ago."

Davyn smiled and put his arm around me as he came to stand by us, "As you say my dear."  He chuckled a bit more.  "We can help with Evangeline, and the others, if you truly want to kill them."

"With them out of the way Brandon will have no stronger allies to call upon."

He nodded, "Then she shall be the easiest of the three remaining.  Death is powerful, but in it comes a price as well."  He smiled at us, he wasn't willing to let his secret out.

Ryan laughed, "He won't tell us."  He turned to Davyn, "Don't think you can hide it from her in the end.  She's a fast learner."

Davyn smiled, "I have no doubt in my mind.  But we all like to keep our little secrets as long as we can now don't we?"

Ant continued the session, "Desmond will be difficult but with the pack and Dimitri at the helm I think we will easily push that, as long as the wolves aren't subject to his emotional outbursts."

Davyn interrupted, "Pack, as in werewolves."

I smiled, "Not just any werewolves, The First werewolves."

Davyn's jaw dropped.  "You have First allies?  I didn't even think they still existed."

"Apparently they are."  Ryan laughed sarcastically.  "Our own wolves will train with them and hunt with them when the moon phases them."

Davyn turned to me, "You are a powerful ally, more so than I had originally thought.  How do we keep Desmond from controlling their emotions."

A woman from behind us spoke softly, "With magic of course."

I turned to see a pretty red head who was no bigger than my wrist all the way around.  Davyn walked up to her and put his arms around her lovingly, "This is Skylar, my consort, my love, she's a witch."

"A wiccan," she and I said at the same time.

She smiled at me, "And you must be his wife to be."

I smiled back.  "You can craft enough to protect all of them?"

Skylar laughed, "When they said you were too the point I thought they were exaggerating."  She skipped ahead of her own thoughts, "Yes, yes I think I can.  If you will help me?"

I nodded and turned back to the meeting. "And Virgil must be done in the daylight when all are awake. Everyone must be wide awake or the cracks will be hard to pin down.  Virgil doesn't need much."

"And your former lover will be joining us then?"  Davyn inquired.

"Tony is a great fighter. I'd have him with us for all of it if he thought he could work with me."

Skylar put her arm around me, "Perhaps for the good of the cause he will join us."

Ryan shook his head, "I doubt he will.  He's pretty beat up over his wife and daughter.  He can't work with Cari well.  He tried.  He really did."

I nodded.  "We have other things to worry about.  Plans are made, we should move on with everything."
