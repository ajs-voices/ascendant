# Five Years Later

I took a deep breath when I woke up.  The air rushed into my lungs.  My throat was dry.  I tried to open my eyes, but there was little to be seen, even with vampire eyes.  I felt something pressing down on both of my arms and started to panic.  

I stared down at what pinned my arms.  Two sleeping girls slept on me, curled up against my body.  They stirred.  I pulled my arms from underneath them and then looked up at me with a smile.  It melted my heart seeing those beautiful smiles looking up at me.  

I heard "Mommy" but neither of their lips moved.  I smiled at them

"Yes.  Which one are you?"  I looked at the one who'd been a sleep on my right arm.  

She smiled at me and shrugged.  "Great", I said then I noticed a necklace hanging at their necks.  One was an M and the other a C.  Well wasn't that nice.

I pointed at the one on my right.  Her hair was jet black with beautiful blue eyes.  "You are Carissa."  And I pointed at her sister, her hair was much lighter but they had the same beautiful blue eyes.  "You are Morgan."

They beamed at me and nodded.  "How long have I been a sleep?"

They both shrugged.  "You don't say much do you?"  I smiled.

I heard, "We've never had to.   We just woke up."  I think it was from Carissa?

"Carissa?"

She nodded and smiled at me.  "Okay.  But you just woke up.  How old are you?"  They shrugged.  I was confused.  They were my children.  I could feel them, I knew it was the girls I'd held only moments ago.  But here they were looking about 5 years old.  

I climbed out of the bed we were in.  It was a hospital bed, and we were all stuck with IV needles, though the IVs looked to be empty for a while.  The room shook, dust fell from the ceiling.  

I started looking around the room.  There were no lights, no obvious exits.  On the wall opposite the bed hung clothes, my clothes it looked like and my weapons.  On the floor was a neat pile of little girl clothes.  

The girls sat on the bed holding each other's hand.  They were watching me while I figured things out.  I saw no visible door in the room, there must be a way out.  But first things first, "Girls can you get up and get dressed?"

Carissa and Morgan hopped off and got dressed.  I pulled the clothes off the peg on the wall and got dressed.  I watched as the girls picked out identical outfits with one exception.  Morgan put her hair up in a red headband and Carissa decided to leave hers hanging.  I smiled.  I was still confused, very confused.  I strapped on my sword, and noticed a second hung with it.  I strapped on both and pulled down the sheaths for the daggers, they'd fit on their little thighs.  I kneeled and put a sheath on the outer right thigh.  I pulled a dagger out and I put it against my forearm and cut.  "Sharp, be careful.  You might need them."  I checked the status of the swords and daggers and everything was well maintained.

I started searching for a latch or something that would trigger the door to open.  

Morgan tugged on my shirt and did something with her hands.  I got down to her level and she showed me again.  Carissa understood her sister and smiled at me and spoke in my mind again, "Magic."

I looked at Morgan.  "Good idea. You'll have to teach me your signs later."  Morgan shook her head.  I looked at Crrissa, "She wants to speak like you, but her throat hurts, so does mine."

I nodded, "Ah, mine too.  You can speak then?"

Carissa shrugged, "We will try."

"I don't have anything to drink except my blood.  Do you want to try to see if it helps?"

Both of the girls gave me that look that could only be said to be disgusting.  I smiled.  "Okay we'll find a way out first then find something to drink."

They nodded.  I spread on my magic and sure enough there was a ward on the door to keep us in and others out.  I pulled it down and there was distinct pop and a fizzle.  Something had gone off outside.  The room shook again and I pulled the girls under me until things were settled.

But it wasn't long before the room shook again.  We had to get out of here.  I pushed the hidden door open and on the other side lay darkness and rubble and pretty much the same thing that we were just leaving.  I knelt down to talk to the girls again.  "Can you feel Daddy?"

Carissa and Morgan nodded with a smile.  "Alright, which way?"  They both pointed to the north.  "Okay North it is.  Before we go.  I want to keep you near me, so I don't have to worry about you."  I grabbed the bed sheet and ripped it into long strips and started making slings and harness.  In a few moments I had large enough slings to fit the girls in.  "Carissa, hope up on the bed and climb on my back and put this over my neck."  She did so.  "Morgan, hold this and you will sit at my left side.  Leaving my right hand free to fight if we need to."

And we were ready.  I peeked around the corner of the room and saw nothing.  We crept through the halls of the rundown compound.  I didn't recognize anything.  And I was alone.  I could barely feel Ant or my sires.  They must be far away.  I missed having Ryan and Mia and Tony in my mind.  I knew Tony was alive, the girls felt him.  I was glad that he was alive and that my death would not be the end of them.  But I missed them.  

Both of the girls gave me a hug and it startled me out of my thoughts.  "Thanks girls." I had to focus on getting out of the building.  

I heard thunder that was not thunder - bombs.  Bombs were falling above us.  I cloaked the girls in shadow and crept down the hall.  No point in making them a target.  I kept trying to go north.  I we kept running into dead end of collapsed tunnels.

I didn't know the compound well enough and I didn't know where I was, much less what was safe or what time of day it was.  I only had one choice to make.  I had to keep moving slowly and try to find a way out.

The girls held hands and the other hand searched for something.  Carissa put her hand on my neck and I felt a nagging feeling.  Morgan put her hand on my bare arm and I felt Tony.  I smiled.  "Thank you."  I tried to find a safe spot, but everything looked dead.  "Morgan you look left and Crrissa you look right.  You pinch me really hard if there is anything coming.  I'm going to try something."  They nodded.

I closed my eyes and I felt across the girls to their connection to their father.  He was both of their father.  And that made my eyes snap shut and I smiled, that was another mystery for later, but they were both Tony's that made me elated and my happiness spread to the girls and I felt Tony start.  I tried to send calming sensations, he seemed to understand.  I tried to ask for time of day.  I sent pictures of the sky, sun and moon.  

He returned a moon and I smiled brightly.  I sent a walk sign or a don't walk sign.  And prayed he understood what I meant.  He sent me a blinking walk sign.  I sighed and then I opened my eyes.  "Girls we are going to travel through the shadows nearest to Daddy.  It might make you feel funny but hold on okay.  We'll be safe when we get there."  They nodded and wrapped their arms around all of us.  It was a giant bear hug.  And I stepped into the shadow and thought of only Tony.
