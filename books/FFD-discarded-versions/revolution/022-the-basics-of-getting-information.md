# The Basics Of Getting Information

The next time I woke up I was laying in what smelled like an infirmary with an IV in my arm.  I tried to open my eyes, but all I saw was a blurry room.  I tried to blink away the clouds, nothing helped.  I heard someone speak softly, "She's awake, what do I do?"

I felt a hand on my head and a light shine in my eyes.  "She's waking up, that's good.  She's perking up with that IV in her arm."

I blinked again and I was able to see strangers standing over me.  The woman standing above me smiled, "Cari, it's okay.  I'm Dr. Flanagan, you can call me Eve."

I blinked again and I was able to focus.  She smiled again, "You've been sedated for a week.  We needed you to regain your strength."  She grabbed my hand, and pulled me to sit up.  "You wanted to sit right."  I nodded.  "I'm a weak empath."  That explained it.

I looked around; I was the only one in the room.  Eve called over her shoulder, "Tell Tristan and Tony she's awake."

I shook my head.  Eve smiled, "It's okay, they are upset, but they've been bugging us all week to see you.  Tony was very worried."

I fell back in the bed.  Eve pulled me forward again.  "Sit up, you need to sit.  You have to stretch your muscles."

I sighed.  "Why didn't they just let me die?"  It was a rhetorical question.  

Eve patted my back, "I'll let them explain everything to you." And as if on cue Tony and Tristan's large frames graced my poor vision, I fell back in the bed.  

Eve sighed, "Get her to sit up for a while."

Tony nodded and I rolled over away from them.  

"I guess we deserve that."  Tristan was in a good mood.

"Cari, we need to talk."

I shrugged.  "Johnny won't give up any information."

I didn't look over my shoulder, "He won't if you treat him like a human."

Tony walked around and pulled up a chair and sat in front of me.  "I told you she'd say you were doing it wrong."

Tristan asked me, "What am I having them do wrong?"

"You are torturing him.  You are trying to make him talk."  I rolled over so I could look at his reaction.  "You have to torture Zach.  Kill Zach if it comes down to it.  I didn't bring him here for the hell of it."

Tristan nodded, "He said you'd say something like that. We've tortured Zack too, no luck."

"You're just doing it wrong."  I rolled over, I'd rather look at Tony, but I closed my eyes.  I didn't want to see him smiling back at me.

"Doc said to make her sit, I have a better idea."  Tony pushed me out of bed.  

Tristan jumped out of the way.  My anger rose and I stood up and turned to see Tony laughing at me.  "That was quite the stunt, did you see that Trist."  I glared at him but the anger left me.  

"Come on.  I've a present for you."  Tristan looked at Tony with questioning eyes.  "Trist you may want to go the other way.  You won't like the present."

"Uh uh,"  He shook his head, "No way I'm letting her out of my sight with what I think you mean."

Tony led me down the hall into unmodified areas of the caves below Dangdburgh.  As we walked the maniacal laughter in my head grew stronger.  Tony opened a door that was guarded by two really big vampires, inside Johnny hung by iron chains.

I looked at Tony.  "Tristan said if he couldn't get anything out of him by the time you woke up and were strong enough, he'd let you take a crack at him.  I told him it would be dangerous."

I looked at Tristan he nodded, "Give it a go.  I trust you."

That was new, I knew he was lying it was clearly written all over his face.  "You lie."  

He nodded, "Yeah I do, but he trusts you."  He nodded to Tony.  "I'll take that."

I nodded.  "Bring Zack in here.  And silver chains."

Tristan left the room long enough to relay the message.  I looked at Johnny for the first time.  He looked back at me with longing eyes.  He thought I would spare him.  I licked my lips and his expression changed to pure fear.  He saw no hope now.  I smiled at him and he screamed, "Keep her away from me."  He tried to back into the wall but he couldn't move and I smiled even wider.  

The door opened and I looked as the two gnarly vampires dragged Zack in by the arms, and a scrawny human tossed in some silver chains.  I grabbed the chains and the silver burnt my hands.  I hung the chain on the peg next to Johnny.  I unclasped on hand and wrapped it in the silver manacle.  His skin burnt and he screamed in pain.  I did the other and tossed the other chain to the other side of the room on the floor.  Tony hung Zack on the opposite wall.

I turned to Johnny, "I will ask you one time and only one time before I get the answer the hard way.  Your life will end here and now without any more pain, it will be quick like Breeana's.  Where are they?"

He spat at me.  I smiled. " Have it your way."

I turned to Zach.  "I'll ask you the same thing, the same conditions."  He spat, but it lacked conviction.  An evil grin spread across my face as I took my silver dagger from my sleeve and I sliced his shirt from his body.  He had raw scars on his body.  He'd been recently tortured.  I cocked my head then ran a line down across his stomach, it wasn't very deep but the wound did not heal immediately with the silver against his skin.

I looked at Johnny and smiled, "Shall I make him a unic."  Johnny stared at me.  I smiled back, I turned around to Zach and unbutton his pants, then pulled them to his ankles.  I licked my lips.  Zach tried to protect himself.  I took his family jewels in my hand and rolled them in my hands.  I looked up at Zach as he hung.  He couldn't help but accept the tender touch.  I sliced down the middle and he screamed in pain.  I smiled up at him.  I sliced a cross along his stomach.  I licked the line of blood welling up from the new cut and stared in his eyes.  

Tristan muttered, "My god, she likes this."

Tony touched Tristan's arm, "It's not too late to leave."

Tristan shook his head, "If you are staying so am I.  I don't know how you can watch your girlfriend do this."

He looked over at Tristan, "I've seen her do worse things."

Fear showed on Tristan's face.

I took a look at Johnny his eyes were closed, "We can't have that."  I pulled at his eye lids and I cut them off.  He screamed in pain.  I slit his stomach and pulled out his intestines.  "Heal that."

I turned my attentions back to Zach.  "Where are they?"

I cut off Zach's fingers one at a time and made Johnny eat them.  I was about to cut off the part of Zach that made him a man when he spoke clearly.  "They are at the old refinery."  I stopped in mid slice and slight pulled out my sword and took of Zach's head.  As promised, it was a clean death.

Johnny cried out, "He told you."

I turned back to Johnny, "I told you your death would be quick if you told me.  His death was quick as I promised you on the other hand I'm going to bleed."

Tristan took my shoulder and pulled me back. "No."

I looked back at the man keeping me from my new toy.  He calmly said it again, "No."

Tony took my sword from my hand and ended Johnny's life.  His head rolled on the floor and I was disappointed.  Tristan looked at Tony, Tony shrugged, "She would kill to bleed him.  He had to die.  He may have been useful, but she hasn't hunted in a very long time.  We couldn't leave him here for her to play with.  She'd kill whoever got in her way."  

Tristan looked at me with fear in his eyes.  I only looked back at him out of the bloody haze.  Tony leaned in behind Tristan, "You need to leave now."

Tristan turned around and looked at him, Tony smiled, "Unless you want to see what's next."

"And what's next?"  He really didn't know.

Tony didn't smile.  "Sex.  Trading one lust for another."

Tristan looked back at me,"But she's calm."

Tony nodded, "Because you are here, you said No.  She wouldn't have listened if you hadn't been exuding calm all over her.  You have no idea what you do, but you tame the wild beast.  But if I don't make it change, she'll hunt and she'll kill.  She needs to sedate her lust."

Tristan reigned in  his power and I felt more like myself.  I glared at him and I reached for him.  He'd told me no.  Tony threw Johnny's head at me, "I killed him."

I turned my gaze on him and Tristan left the room.

Tony had my sword and he tossed it back and forth from hand to hand.  I threw the daggers on the ground.  He followed suit and then lunged at me.  He threw me against the wall.  My breath was crushed from my lungs.  He threw me to the other side of the room.  I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move, as he threw me from wall to wall.    He kissed me and everything melted away until I bit his tongue and drew blood.  He slapped me and I looked back at him with a bloodlust.  I threw myself at him and he grabbed me as we fell into the wall together.  

Tristan pulled the door shut when someone tried to come in and stop us.  I looked at the door and a way out I tried to go for it but Tony was there and he barred my way.  We grappled until he could pull me close enough to kiss me again.  I tried to push him away.  He kissed me again.  I gave a little.  In the back of my mind I fought for control.  Fought to put the beast back in its cage.  I wanted Tony.  I wanted him badly.  He could have uses his powers to calm me, but he didn't.  He beat me until I was nothing but a bloody pulp in his hands.  He kissed me again and I returned the kiss, he fed me his power through that kiss.  He gave me the strength so we could have sex for the first time in over eight hundred years.
