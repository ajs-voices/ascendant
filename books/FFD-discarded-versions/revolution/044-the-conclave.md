# The Conclave

Tony and I walked with William's daughter to the house by the sea.  It was just a little thing, barely big enough for the old man himself, but it seemed to house more souls than humanly possible.  Everyone waved as we walked by all with great big smiles.  They were happy to see us, even though we had never met them in our lives.  She led us to a small room inside the house, it was covered in maps and various other things that indicated to me that they were tracking something or planning it, I wasn't sure which.

A group of young men stood around the table with a spread out map of the entire USA.  I didn't know any of them but when they looked up and saw us their smiles were brighter than the candles in the room.  I heard footsteps behind me, Ryan draped his arms around me and Tony.  "There you two are.  These men have something to show us."  He wiggled between the two of us.  He held out his hand to the men in front of him, "I'm Ryan Elliott, this is Cari and Tony Giovanni."  He giggled, "No relation, well..."

"That's enough Ryan."  He liked being silly at the worst of times.  He gave me a mock frown and puppy dog eyes.  I sighed and smacked him on the shoulder, "Behave."  He laughed.

The men made their introductions - Steve, Riley and Scott were the names of the other three men.  They claimed to be former military, before the New Order had taken over.  They drew Tony over to the table, I don't think they counted me as a military mind, but that was fine with me I'd watch and listen and learn.  I was use to the feeling.  Ryan looked up at me to make sure I took no offense.  He smiled and nodded.  He knew me far better than anyone else did. 

Steve spoke quietly, as if he were trying to hid his words from me, but I guess he forgot I was vampire.  "This is where we are."  He placed a little green army man toy on the map.  He placed several more in California and along the west coast.  "These are conclaves that support what remains of your CHSB."  He placed some blue army men in various places moving east into the mountains.  "I believe these are Therian camps that are loyal to the Beast King."  He took what looked to be some dice and placed them in the plains.  "These are camps that we think are loyal to the CHSB or some factions of the old vampire world."  He looked up at me and smiled, "Il Cane still has many who fear her.  And I'd bet my next meal to say that these camps would follow her if she were to show up."

Steve was still smiling at me so I spoke up, "So you believe, that if we show up on their door steps, friend or possible friend we've have more allies?"

He nodded, "And here I thought you let others do the thinking."

Tony laughed, "Seriously you don't know her very well.  She probably is one step ahead of you in terms of what she wants to know."

Steve smiled, "If that's the case, what is it Il Cane wants to know?"

"Where is Valence?  And what are the most influential targets along the way there."  It was simple.  Make a swath through their territory and take out Valence.  He was the worst of the enemies at hand.  Brandon might be the head, but Valence was the teeth and claws.  He had to go first.

Steve turned back to his map and put down a plastic gold coin.  "Valence is here."  He thought about what lie between and smiled.  He placed two silver coins between us and the golden one.  "Here are two canneries, the human livestock processing plants.  We believe Valence is also at a cannery."

I watched as Tony looked at the map.  He was formulating a plan.  I smiled, "We need as much intell on those three places we can get our hands on.  Tony will make plans with you.  He seems to be deep in thought." 

Tony looked up at me with a smile, "You are going to follow my plan?"  I nodded, "I'll believe it when I see it."

I smiled at him, "I'm not going to rush in alone to three places I know nothing about."

He nodded, "Which is why you want me to have the intel first.  So you aren't tempted."

It was my turn to nod, "So I'm not tempted.  I have two children to train.  They aren't staying here."

Ryan looked up, "And the other two?"

"They will learn weapons, and what I can show them of their powers, but I am not Therian, we will need to find a Therian teacher for them."  

He nodded.  "I'll find one."  

One of the other men, I think it was Riley, "You are going to take children with you?"  He looked appalled.

"These children can survive more than you can.  With the proper training and instruction and a good mentor, they can be better at fighting than you are."

He looked about ready to bit my head off.  "You think these children are a better fighter than me?"

"Not right now they aren't, they lack training, they lack skill.  But they are stronger and faster than you are, in my book that will make them better than any human can be."

He looked at Ryan, "Do you see what she thinks of your skill?"

Ryan laughed, "Sir, she means no offense, she's just stating the facts.  And I am over 700 years old.  I am stronger and faster and I was trained by Il Cane for almost my entire life.  I am no mere human.  I am Chevalier."

He looked like he was going to blow a fuse.  You could almost see the light bulb go off in his head, "So train us."

I smiled, "I will train the children.  If others wish to watch and do and follow as the children do, you are welcome.  But I will not treat them as more than children.  It is best to learn when you are young."

Ryan laughed, "And when she says that she means it.  It was more than a hundred years after I started training that I finally was treated like an adult when it came to weaponry.  But she will train you to be the best."

Riley and the others looked at me with what I could only classify as hatred.  I didn't care, I would do as I always did and they could do what they did.  I turned without saying another word and left the men to do their work.  Even my own thoughts were sarcastic on that feeling.  For being such a progressive time, it was no better than the world I grew up in.

I found the children sitting around the table still eating.  I sat down with then and one of the women offered me a glass of something.  I shook my head and she took it away.  She never even told me what it was or forced me to try it.  This conclave seemed to very use to catering to vampires.  I wondered what they had done prior to this war.

I noticed the children were all looking at each other.  I closed my eyes and listened as they ate in what appeared to be in silence.  I could feel a very lit touch and knew what was going on.  Carissa was linked to the children and they were talking amongst the strangers.  They weren't being rude but they weren't being social either.  They would have to learn to communicate normally, but that was for a later time.  Carissa felt me on the edge of their circle.  She smiled at me as she included me in their conversation.

Morgan thought at the group, "These are good.  We should hide a few for later."

I smiled and put my hand on Morgan's outreached hand and spoke out loud, "No Morgan, there will be plenty for later.  We don't need to hoard food."

She frowned softly.  I put a finger under her chin and lifted her eyes.  "I'm sure they are wonderful, why don't you thank the ladies for their efforts."

Morgan smiled and nodded.  But she didn't know how to communicate her thanks.  Leyla smiled, "Ma'am.  We want to thank you for these cookies.  They are wonderful."  The women beamed with pride.

One turned to me, "You can understand them?"

I nodded, "It's not so much as understanding as being included.  My own powers are very weak in that field of vampiric powers.  I can prevent it from happening to me and feel when someone else is but beyond that I'm as out of it as you are."

She smiled with happiness.  "Maybe we can help them communicate with the rest of us.  We understand from Mister Elliott that they slept for five years so didn't get to be toddlers and explore."

I nodded.  "Unfortunately but thankfully Carissa can speak with her mind and Morgan is gaining skill in Empathy.  They are learning, but yes, if you'd like to help them speak I would be grateful."

She bounced away to tell the others what I'd said.  I was happy to let them help. 

I turned my attention to the four children, "Now let's go outside, we've some other learning to do."
