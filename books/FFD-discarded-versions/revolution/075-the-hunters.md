#The Hunters

Virgil was gone and Evangeline and Desmond were the only two left standing.  The only two left between full out war on Brandon Holt, our creator and our destruction.  He may have been one of many who created our kind.  But he destroyed us just as he created us by giving us a public face.  We would never again live in the shadows because of him.  How the world was changing.

Jesse and I recovered for days.  Very few people wanted to be near us.  Jesse was feared among the humans.  He had almost killed me and many were afraid he would try again.  But we knew better.  It wasn't the first time the Dream walker had possessed someone in our group.  How they had gotten to Jesse I don't know, but it didn't take much for the dream walker to get a hold of one's mind.

Evangeline was next on our list.  She was one that was going to be difficult to kill.  Her strongest ability was being able to control many vampires at the same time.  She was dangerous to any vampire.  The humans and Therians would be key to this battle, and they didn't even realize how much we were going to depend on them.

We had plenty of time to plan this attack.  But what we hadn't counted on was a large number of human vampire hunters walking up to our door step.  New Haven was a place few people actually knew existed much less vampire hunters or any other human for that matter.  New Haven was safety for the occult, for people of supernatural abilities.  It took supernatural abilities to find New Haven other wise you'd be politely turned in another direction without even knowing it.

But early one morning a small girl came running into our so called home.  "Miss Cari.  Miss Cari." she shouted as she ran around looking for me.

When I stepped into view she nearly collided into me.  She grinned up at me but then quickly turned around, "Come, Follow me.  Quickly."

The citizens of New Haven were now my responsibility, there was little I could do, I could feel the pull to help, whatever it was that was the problem.  But it wasn't magic that made me want to help.  I was surprised to find that it was the sheer wanting to that made me move quickly with the little girl.

Once outside and to the edge of town, I saw the mass of humans with torches sitting on the edge of the town lines as if there were a magical barrier keeping them out.  I leaned down to the little girl and told her to go someplace safe.  She didn't hesitate and ran back off into town.

I stared out into the crowd.  I wasn't sure what or who I would find.  There were many angry faces, but all were dirty and weary.  I walked towards them in hopes that someone would step forward as their leader.  The mass started to part and in the throng of humans stood a familiar face - Taylor Graves.  

Taylor didn't advance, nor did he let go of the girl's hand he held.  She was probably not a girl anymore, but she clung to her protector and guardian like I was going to kill her.  I smiled, "Taylor.  Annabeth.  Why are you here?"

The mass of people surrounded the three of us.  Annabeth quietly asked, "How do you know my name?"

"I know a great many things about you."

She stood firmly and puffed out her chest like she was threatening me, "Like what?"

I laughed, "Like you take after your guardian in his hatred of me.  That he saved you from a coven of vampires that ravaged your family and town."

Annabeth's poise dropped and she lessened her guard.  "And you killed his family."

I shook my head, "No Annabeth, I did not.  I killed the vampire who killed his family; he caught me after that fact.  He does not believe because he does not wish to."

Taylor spoke up, "I believe you.  Now.  That is why we are here, because I believe you are the only hope of saving the human race from slavery and slaughter."

I nodded, "If you and your friends promise me that they will not take the life of any of my kind until this war is over, we will offer you food and shelter and bring you into the battle at hand.  We could use your help."

The crowd nodded their acceptance, "Until the war is over."

I nodded.  "Come with me."

They followed me into town.  Their torches lighting the way.  Taylor caught up to me, "Is this going to be okay with the Jarl?"

I turned to look at him, "What do you know of New Haven?"

Taylor smiled, "Enough to know to stay away from it, even though it would be a good place to kill many vampires if I ever wanted to end my life."  He laughed.  It wasn't all that funny but he thought he was being clever so I smiled.

"Davyn won't mind.  He charged me with protecting his people, that's what I'm doing.  If your people follow the agreement then we will all be fine and can work together."

As if his name called him Davyn appeared in the distance.  He looked over the incoming influx of people and nodded.  When we were within easy listening range he spoke to us, "It is good to have you.  I trust Cari has reached an agreement as you are all hunters of some sort or another?"

Taylor nodded, "She has.  It's a pleasure to meet you Jarl.  And a bigger pleasure to be working with you to end this war."

Davyn smiled at me, "He's eloquent."

"He's being polite so you don't kick him out."

Taylor laughed.  "I was not"

Davyn nodded, "They will come in handy, yes?"

I nodded, "Yes.  They will be very handy in the next phase."

Taylor turned to me, "What's your plan?"  He paused a moment and waved his hand and two other men came forward.  They looked grim and touch.  They gave me that I'm going to kill you look I'd seen so many times from hunters.  Taylor continued, "This is Dom and Rick, they are actually the leaders of this crowd."

I nodded.  "A pleasure I'm sure."

They glared at me and I turned back to Taylor, "Our plan is to go after Evangeline and then Desmond before taking out Brandon."

Dom was a large man and when he spoke softly I was surprised, "You are on a first name basis with these monsters?"

I smiled to lessen the blow "Evangeline and Desmond are two of my sires.  Brandon is the brother of one of my father figures in my life.  So yes I know then by first name."

They all stared back at me. I shook my head and got straight back to business, there was no point rehashing their hatred of me and my kind, "Evangeline is a Necromancer, she controls the dead, and more specifically vampires.  None of our vampires can safely go up against her.  We have to rely on humans and Therians."

Rick asked, "Therians?"

Taylor laughed, "We don't know much about other supernatural creatures.  We hunt vampires and pretty much only vampires."

I nodded.  "Therians are shape-shifters of sort.  In the movies you would call a Wolf Therian a Werewolf."

Shock ran across the other two men's faces.  One shuddered, "What else is real?"

"There are many things supernatural that exist.  You'd be surprised by every one of them, but none of them are here, just human magic, Therian and vampire.  The lot of you will have to go in to kill Evangeline.  I will go, but other than Ant I'm not sure any other vampire will make it without causing more harm to the cause."

"Why can you go?  You are a vampire too."  Rick asked.

"I was created and trained to resist any vampire magic any given vampire could throw at me.  Evangeline was my teacher. I know what she is capable of."  I looked around to the other men, "We won't just be killing vampires.  Humans have taken sides with them.  They wield guns and will shoot you on sight.  You can't be squeamish about who you kill.  We kill anyone in our way"

Dom, Rick and Taylor looked at each other surveying each other.  It was almost telepathic, but I knew better it was something you learned by being close with someone else.  They nodded, "We will take this to our fellows and make sure only those willing will come with us.  How do you intend to do this?"

Davyn and I lead our new found friends to the planning area and Ant and Ryan went through the plan again.  We would attack at day.  That brought up questions about me and the sunlight. I assured them I would be fine.  It didn't take long for the plan to be conveyed.  They went to their fellows and with the hour we were ready to go.

It was a lot quicker than I had expected really.  Dimitri had Gnart, the leader of the First be our liaison to the remainder of the Therians.  Gnart was a man tiger.  It was off putting but he was a gorgeous specimen.  Gnart was also telepathic and he grinned widely at me when I thought it.  His voice was gravely from vocal cords that weren't quite right for human speech, "You are a fine specimen yourself."

I laughed.  "We have more important things to do."

Taylor cracked a joke, "You'll sleep with anything won't you?"

"I slept with you."  I retorted.

Taylor laughed, but the others around him stared at him in shock.

Taylor started to defend himself, but I interrupted him, "There is no need to defend your actions.  Anyone of them would do the same given the chance."  I glared at them.

Dom was angry, "You are saying that you are that irresistible?"  He turned to his comrades, "Such an ego."

I laughed.  And sauntered over to him with that alluring walk Evangeline had taught me so long ago.  I didn't even have to extend my powers.  I ran my fingers down Dom's puffed out chest and you could see his reaction long before he walked away from me.  "I know how to do what I do and I do it well.  Magic or no, I can seduce the lot of you."
