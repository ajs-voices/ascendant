# The Sky Is Falling

Tony was whispering with the little girl.  I smiled he was very good with children.  As we reached the town our girls raced towards us.  First wrapping themselves around their father, and then clung to me.  I lifted then with ease.  The girl Tony held eyed them.  I stopped and Tony stopped and we brought the girls together.  

I smiled at the little one in Tony's arms, "This is Carissa."  I shifted her on my hip.  And then tossed Morgan, "And this is Morgan."  They smiled brightly at the new arrival.

Tony smiled, "This is Leyla."

I set Carissa and Morgan down, "Would the two of you like to show Leyla around?"  They nodded and Morgan held a hand out to Leyla.  The three girls scampered off to get into something.  As long as they were happy it didn't matter right now.

Thea smiled, "I think she will fit in well with your girls.  But be careful, Cari, she's more like you than you know."

I nodded, "I can feel the scars."  Thea nodded with a smile.  I added, "Shall we?"

Tony took my hand and we made our way into the long building.  The symbols were drawn and Tristan sat in the circle waiting.  He glared at us through the veil of hatred.  I smiled.  I would enjoy this.

There were some men and woman that I didn't know.  I didn't matter.  "All lesser Chevalier made?"  They all nodded.

I turned to Tony and offered him my wrist.  And he offered me his.  We both bit and muttered the words that came with making lesser Chevalier.   I could see Aurora and Francesco watching from entangled arms.  They smiled like happy parents.  I smiled.

"Vampires."  They all touched me and left the building.  They didn't need to stay.  Tony touched me and I nodded.  I said the words.  "Humans."  And then the humans gave their souls to Tristan.  He would take them to hell.  Once again, we swore our souls to the eternal fires of hell, if you believed in such things.   They all left.  I looked around and Tony was the only one left in the room.  I turned to the man before us.  He was wild.  There was nothing human left in him.  I blessed his soul to the earth and I chopped of his head in one swift motion.  His husk of body fell forward and the blood spurted from the wound.  

I felt the magic working.  I felt Tony's bond solidify in my mind.  I watched as he closed his eyes.  I felt him relax through the newly formed bond.  He was home again.  And I didn't realize how lonely it had been before.

The ground shook and we heard screaming from outside.  Another thunder clap and one wall of the building fell in.  Tony grabbed my hand and we stepped into the shadows where the girls were.  All around there was screaming.  We each grabbed a girl, Tony took Leyla in his arms, and I grabbed a little boy who had been with the girls.  

Before we could move Ant and Ryan were next to us.  Ant was breathless, "Bombs, missiles of some sort from the south."

Thea was standing in the doorway to the house we were in, a bomb landed just outside the door and I saw her body explode from the sound wave alone.  I yelled, "Move" And we moved as a unit.  We all stepped into the shadows and leapt someplace safe.  We landed on the teetering edge of a cliff.  I looked out over the cliff and saw the ocean and all its peaceful bliss.  I looked at Carissa and Morgan.  "Find cover.  Take the other children with you.  Keep them safe."

They drew their little daggers as if they knew what to do and they led the children down the cliff.  

I looked at the men with me, "Where can we get to that is behind them?"

Ant nodded, "I know a place."  We wasted no time.  We stepped into the Shadows.

In front of us we saw a tank and men in military armaments.   I recognized the man on the tank bellowing orders.  I anger rose and Tony grabbed my arm.  "We'll draw their attention, you sure you want to do this?"

I nodded.  I wanted to kill Salvador Einor myself.  I wanted to see the fear in his eyes when I brought my sword to bear on his neck.

Tony, Ant and Ryan all went one direction.  I waited for them to draw some of the attention.  

I walked through a line of men with guns and sliced them through with my swords.  The blood raining down felt glorious.  I wanted to do more, but I had eyes for only one thing.  Men turned and starting shoot me.  Thankfully none were silver and I continued to my target unhindered by the bullets.  I sliced through the final line of me and jumped on to the powerful tank.  Sal has watched my progress he never showed an ounce of fear.  When I was in reach he placed his hand on me as he had done so many times before.  

I smiled at him and he tried to cow me with his power.  I drank in the power and Sal's eyes widened.  He'd forgotten the first lesson he'd taught me.  I pulled his power into me.  He fell to his knees.  I held my sword high above his head.  He nodded and mouthed, "I'm sorry."  And I brought the sword down and his head rolled.  I held up my hand his body started to burn. 

The smell of burning flesh made my stomach turn and I hopped down from the tank with Sal's head still in my hand.  

The army of men stood and stared at me.  My body was riddled with bullet holes that were slowly healing, I could feel them oozing blood.  I threw Sal's head to the ground and yelled, "Anyone else?  Be gone with your lives or I shall kill you and send your heads to your so called leaders in a box."

The men dropped their weapons and ran.  We watched them run.  From the forest the wolves ran after the fleeing me.  I smiled and turned my attentions back to the town.  There was little activity.  We searched the rubble for survivors but we found none.  We did not see any of the council, or any of the other humans.  There were no bodies save a few pieces.  

I saw an arm from under the rubble.  I uncovered it only to find it had been severed.  I sighed.  This was a great loss.

Tony touched my arm, "I can feel my father and Henry."

I closed my eyes.  "I feel Aurora.  Alec and Valentine are far away."

Dimitri smiled, "I sent the wolves after the remainder of the men.  I doubt few will survive.  The Fat Wolf King was gracious to heed the call of Il Cane."

I smiled it had been a good encounter it had seemed.  I didn't feel Damian.

"No",  Ryan cried out in pain.

We all ran to him.  He held Mia in his arms.  I closed my eyes and fell to my knees.  A could feel a tear sliding down my cheek, and then another.  Damian was dead if Mia was dead.

Ant put his hands on Ryan and I wrapped my arm around him, Dimitri put his hand on Tony.  Tony touched my arm and we stepped into the shadows to the children.  We could do nothing more here.  We would bury Mia we couldn't stay if they returned.

I called to Aurora.  If she could feel me she'd come when she could.

Behind us there was a rustle and Francesco, Aurora, Henry, Alec and Valentine stepped out of the shadows.  They sighed with relief, but all stopped short when they saw Ryan crying over Mia's body.

Aurora frowned, "Where are the girls?"

I smiled, "Safe, they are finding shelter."

I put my arm around Ryan, "She'll like being buried here.  She can overlook the water."

Ryan looked up and blinked the tears away.  He turned to me with fury.  He punched me in the chest.  I took a step back.  He threw another punch that landed in my chest.  I continued to step backwards while he hit me.  Ryan yelled at me, "If you'd kept the bond she'd be safe."  He drew his gun.  It had silver bullets.

Everything happened so fast.  The gun went off and I stepped backwards, my foot slipped and I fell over the cliff.  I heard screams as they raced to the edge with care.  I closed my eyes.  One hell of a way to die.

I fell and I felt at peace with it all.  Ryan had done what he'd said, even if he hadn't meant to do it right now.  I knew the ground had to be near.  I braced for impact.

I was surprised to find that when I hit I sank into the rocks below.  I heard stunned shouts from above.  I opened my eyes and saw standing above me my daughter.  Morgan smiled brightly at me as she reached for my hand.  Crrissa was holding the other children back.  When I grabbed her hand I felt her power flowing into the earth.  When I was clear of the ground I hugged the child tightly.   "Thank you Morgan."

She smiled at me and I opened my arms to the rest of the children and the came to me and I held them all.  The little boy cried in my arms, the girls held on to me and each other.  

A few moments later the rest of them were down on the ground stepping out of the shadows of the cave in the cliff.  Ryan stayed at the entrance sobbing.  Tony was relieved and he hugged me tightly.  "What the hell happened?"

I smiled, "Our lovely little daughter here."  I tapped Morgan on the back and she squeezed tighter, "softened the earth."  He wrapped his arms around me and the children.

He lifted the little boys head.  "Oh my god."  He turned and called, "Ryan"

Ryan walked over to us and stood above us.  He looked down and stared at the little boy.  He wept.  I looked up at Tony, he neither smiled nor frowned, I didn't know what to make of his expression.  "This is Lee.  Mia and Damian's adopted son."

I hugged the little boy tighter.  "Ryan, what do you want to do?"

He looked at me helpless.  "I'm not a father.  I don't want to be a father."  He looked at me pleading, "Will you care for him?"

I smiled and stood up, the children let go and held on to each other.  I hugged Ryan, "I will as if he were my own."  He hugged me.

He pushed me away from him and looked at me like he was inspecting me.  "I shot you."

"The bullet never hit as far as I can tell."

He laughed, "So I can't even kill you with a gun."

Tony smiled, "You can't even kill her if you push her off a cliff."  Everyone laughed.  I smiled and hugged my friend.  Ryan hugged me tightly, I returned it, that was the most apology either one of us was going to give.  But we both accepted it.  We'd been through a lot.  

Ryan whispered in my ear, "You think she'll really like it here."

I nodded, "Yeah I do.  The sky here is beautiful at night and the sunsets are beyond anything you've ever seen."  I cried softly into his shoulder.  I would miss my friend very much.
