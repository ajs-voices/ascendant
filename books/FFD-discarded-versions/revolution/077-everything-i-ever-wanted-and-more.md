#Everything I Ever Wanted and More

When we got back everyone celebrated a little and mourned the loss of our fallen comrades.  We had lost nearly half our forces when Charles came up the rear.  It hadn't been a pretty battle but it was a victory and only Desmond was left.  Desmond wasn't easier he wasn't harder to vanquish, he was just different.

We regrouped. We reached out to our sources and made sure Desmond was where he was supposed to be.  It would take hours before we learned his final whereabouts.  We'd have to change directions if it changed, but for now the whole town celebrated our current victory.  Davyn warmly welcomed the hunters into his home.  And the hunters took what was offered.  Who would refuse free drink and food and a warm place to stay.  I didn't know any who would.

But there was clearly factions within our unit of war.  The Therians kept to themselves.  The New Havenites were in their own little group.  And the refugees were in another.  The hunters were completely separated from the others.  The only group that seemed to mingle was my own family.  Ant bounced between groups laughing and joking with them all.  Ryan danced with all the pretty women regardless of creed.  Even Francesco and Aurora moved from group to group mingling.  We were the glue that held this alliance together.  I'm glad they were doing a far better job of it than I was.

They partied for hours.  Davyn had other plans.  He took me aside to his own home.  He put his arms around me and kissed me with a passion I had not know he'd had.  Davyn whisered to me, "You save us and I find myself oddly attracted to you."  His kiss deepened and I could feel him in my mind.  I could feel his wants and his desires.  

But worse of all I could feel his deepest secrets.  He longed for a life mate.  He longed for his huntress.  Davyn wanted me to fill his deepest needs.  He wanted to hunt with me.  He wanted me to break free of my self made changes and live the life a vampire should live.  

If I had been in my own control instead of at the mercy of my own powers I could have fought the urge to fill his every need, to be a normal vampire.  It rang so close to what Alistair had told me so long ago that looking back on it I'm surprised I let myself go.  But it wasn't my control I lost, it was the power of my empathic connection.  I had not control over it.  I conformed to his need.

There was no longer passion in my loins.  There was no longer a desire to make love to this near stranger.  Lust was no more, I was filled with an over powering hunger.  I had to feed.

I left Davyn's embraced and he looked after me with a confused look.  He didn't understand and I definitely couldn't explain to him right then.  All I wanted was food.

I opened the door and outside stood humans.  I closed my eyes and felt the heart beats and my own heart raced in tandum.  I reached for the nearest man and sank my fangs into his soft throat.  He gasped for air and surprise as I drank deeply from him.  

I could feel the life leaving the man, but before I could take the last of his life force from him I was ripped away from the close to dead man. I felt a familiar calming affect wash over me.  I looked up and found Tony grasping me from behind.  He wasn't paying me any attention as he glared at Davyn.

Tony yelled.  "What the hell did you think you were doing?"  He yelled at Davyn, not at me.  I found the thought oddly soothing, he wasn't directing his anger at me for once.

Davyn stared at the two of us.  "I was going to make love to her.  As if it were any of your business, and she just walked away."

Tony pulled me inside and slammed the door before loosening his grip on me.  He didn't hold me tightly but I had no desire to leave.  Tony shook his head, "You're a fool.  You can't give her your full self.  She can't handle it."  

Davyn looked at me as if I were a stranger to him, "She's strong enough to handle it, you just never give her the credit."

Tony laughed, "Does this look strong enough?  Does she look like she wants to be your lover?  Does this," Tony grabbed my shoulders and made me face Davyn, "look like she is handling it well?  She was going to kill that man because you wanted her to be normal.  You wanted to hunt with her, you wanted to free her from her chains.  I can feel your stench all over her.  And  I'm not talking about physical smells here."

Davyn looked in the mirror and then back at me, "I did want that.  All I did was give her myself, just as she gives me."

Tony nodded, "Yeah, I know."  He frowned, "But as much as you want to you can't.  I had to fight for months to get her back after I gave her everything of me.  I thought it would help, but it made things worse."

I looked up at Tony, "But that's what gave us Ant."

He looked down at me and smiled, "You know that for sure?"

I nodded and smiled.  

Davyn looked at us with something akin to hatred, "Why is she so calm, if she wants to hunt so bad?"

Tony let me go and the hunger washed over me again.  I tried to make a dash for the door behind me but Tony grabbed my wrist just in time and pulled me back into his arms, he spoke softly, "Calm down Cari.  It's okay."  I could feel his warm embrace and the hunger cooled, "We sat for days like this after she killed that town.  And when the hunger would wash over her before we had a supply of blood for her, we would sit like this for hours.  It became second nature."

A light went off in Davyn's eyes, he smiled and frowned all at the same time, "I'm sorry but don't think this union will work."

Tony laughed, "You thought it was going to be easy?"  He laughed harder.

Davyn nodded, "Yes, it should have been."

"If she were normal."

Davyn nodded again, "But she's not.  Sadly."

Tony smiled, "It's not that bad really."  He kissed the top of my head.  "Mind if we have a few moments alone?"  He looked up at Davyn?

"I will come back at dawn, ya'll better not be here."

Tony nodded, "I can't guarantee that, but I will try."

Davyn glared at Tony, "You can't have sex for that long."

Tony smiled at Davyn, "I never said anything about sex.  It's going to take a while to get her out of this state."

There was a knock at the door.  Tony moved me out of the way and Davyn answered the door.  I heard Ryan asked, "Everything okay?"

Davyn looked back at Tony and he nodded, "Tony says it's alright.  I was just leaving."

Ryan poked his head in the door, "You sure you want to do this?"

Tony took a deep breathe, "Yeah.  Time to mend the bond I broke.  Jake talked some sense into me."

Ryan smiled, "Glad someone could.  And I'm glad you let him stick around."

Jake pushed Ryan in to the door, "Let who stick around?"

Jake looked at Tony holding me.  Ryan smiled, "It's okay Jake, he still wants your body too."

I could feel the glare Tony gave Ryan.  Ryan just laughed as he shut the door behind him, "I'm only a thought away."
