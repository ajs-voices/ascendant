# A Stick Of Binding

Ryan and Ant took turns digging a hole on top of the cliff over looking the sea, while Tony and I went to find Damian's body.  We all thought it was best to bury Mia and Damian together if we could.  We hoped there would be something left to bury.  Mia was hardly damaged so we didn't have much hope for finding Damian.  We didn't have long to find him.  The sun would rise and whatever was left would burn, and I would burn with it if I wasn't under shelter.

Tony and I stepped into the shadows outside of the ruins that many of our friends died.  There were no sounds.  War had come to the once peaceful place, the birds and the animals were hiding and they might never return.  

Charred earth and the smell of death was not the only thing that welcomed us when we stepped into town.  Pillagers and looters were already going through the rubble.  These were people who I did not know and Tony's scowl indicated that they were not men and women he knew either.

Out of the rubble stepped the fat king with a gluttonous look on his face.  He looked proud of what he was doing until he saw me and ran the other way.  It was pure habit.  I reached for one of my daggers, which were not on my arms.  I sighed and threw up a line of fire in front of the fat man.  He skid to a stop and turned to look at me with frightened eyes.  He prickled with power, he was afraid of me and I smiled at him.

He watched me as I walked to him.  "Why are you running, Fat King?"

He sneered at me, "I thought.  You mean.., "He looked relieved, "I was looking for survivors."

Tony stepped forward, "I can smell a lie, and you stick of one."  

The fat man cowered before Tony and Tony smiled, I asked, "What did you do that makes you so guilty?"

A man in the shadows stepped out.  He smiled widely at me, "He brought the men to you.  He killed your friends.  Dimitri didn't tell you his folly."  He nodded towards the fat man.

I shook my head, "Dimitri knew?"  

"It is why Dimitri sent us after the men.  To undo what he'd done."  He smiled.  "Dimitri left me in charge but I did not know until a few hours ago we'd lost the king.  Thank you for finding him."

Tony looked at the new man, "You are?"

He smiled, "I'm Michael West, David's father, you do remember my son."

We both nodded, but I looked back at the fat man and I stalked towards him.  He cowered on the crown before the fire.  I got down on my hands and knees and crawled towards him.  "You killed my friend."

Tony reached me before I reached the man, "Cari.  Let him be to his laws."

I growled at the man before me.  I wanted to kill him he was responsible for Mia's death.

Michael smiled, "She can kill him.  It would save me the trouble.  He has already been sentenced by the Beast King.   Not all packs will follow the Beast King's orders, but ours does.  He is a good man."

I looked up at Michael and nodded.  Dimitri was a good man.

"We are looking for Damian.  He is dead, we are burying his wife, we'd like to bury them together.  Have you seen him?"  I tried not to look at the man before me.  I closed my eyes and fought the urge to rip out his throat and bathe in his blood.  It was not what Mia would have wanted.

Michael didn't answer, but more men and women and children came from the forest behind him.  "We will help you find who you are looking for and bury the rest."

I nodded.  He smiled at me, "You can kill the Fat King.  I would very much be honored to have Il Cane do my duty."

Tony smiled and pulled me to my feet.  "Michael West, do you wish to hire the services of Il Cane?"  

Michael looked a bit confused and then it seemed to dawn on his face, "Ah.  Yes, Il Cane, I give you..."He looked around and picked up a stick, "I give you this fine artifact of my people, for the life of the Fat King."

Tony smiled at me.  I looked at Michael; he smiled brightly at me as well.  "I nodded.  It would be my honor to serve you."  And without a second thought about it I cleared my mind of everything but the man in front of me.  But I would honor Mia's death not in blood but severity of punishment.  I drew my sword and I brought it down on top of the cowering fat man.  The strength of the blow slit the man in two symmetrical halves.   As the blade finished its last bit of flash the body burnt.  It was a practiced move and the smell of burning flesh made me gag.  I closed my eyes and fought the need to purge my stomach of nothingness.  I stood and I watched the man's corpse burn.

I don't know how long I stood there watching the fires of my wrath.  Tony touched my arm and I turned to look at him.  He whispered, "They've found Damian's head, the rest they can't tell for sure."

I nodded then turned back to the flames.  They were no longer burning the man I'd killed, they'd long since feed upon the remains, only my wrath was left and I let the flames burn hot and bright.

Tony wrapped his arms around me from behind.  He leaned to my ear and whispered, "Come, it will be light and we need to bury them before then."

Michael handed me a stick with a smile, and he handed Tony a box with what I assumed was what was left of Damian.  I felt a tear slide down my cheek.  "We follow you Il Cane.  You call and we will come.  You have saved us in more ways than we can count and we only wish we could repay you that kindness."

I nodded.  Tony wrapped his arms around me and he stepped us through the Shadows to the top of the cliff.
