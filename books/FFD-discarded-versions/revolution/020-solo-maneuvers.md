# Solo Maneuvers

Tony carried me through the corridors.  People stopped and stared a moment before turning to go back about their business.  He opened a door to a dark room and tossed me.  I yelped, but I landed on the bed.  I laughed, it was actually rather fun.

Tony smiled and shut the door behind him and pulled off his shirt.  "You can stay with me tonight."  

I raised an eye brow at him, he smiled and lay down next to me and draped his arm over my legs and looked up at me sleepily.  I laid down and snuggled up against Tony.  He put his head down on his arm and looked at me.  I looked up at him and kissed his lips tenderly before rolling over on my side.  He tucked me into him and we slept.

When I woke Tony was sitting on the edge of the bed pulling clothes on.  "You use to be up before me."  He leaned over and offered me his wrist.  "Eat.  You need something again.  You are using up too much power on something."

I bit his wrist and pulled in his scent, his power.  It washed over me with uncertainty.  I felt better with every swallow.  Tony pulled his arm away before I had finished.  He looked at me carefully; he turned my head from side to side.  "What?"

"You aren't drinking very much blood but you're siphoning off my energy.  You sure you are okay?"  Tony looked very concerned.

"I feel fine."  

"You don't look fine.  You look weak.  We have to get them back, I think they are draining you, you are keeping them alive, by sucking you dry."  Tony frowned.  "Stay here I'll go get someone else to feed you."

I lay back in bed and closed my eyes.  I saw the caged beast in my mind, and the glass window separating me from my family.  It felt like they stared at me with pleading eyes.  Pleading, "Come Save Me."

I stared at them in my mind, not sure I could help them.  I didn't know where they were.  The Coalition thought they were dead, they didn't know where they were.  I sat up straight.  I knew who would know.  We were under Dangdburgh.  He wouldn't be far from home.  He liked his club too much, the fool.

I got up and slipped out the door and found the time.  I couldn't stride into town in the sunlight.  It was well past midnight.  I thought about Johnny Rose, and then I stepped into the shadows outside his club.  The sign still blinked Frozen.  The mere arrogance, but no one stood outside waiting.  

I opened the door, and an alarm sounded.  I walked in to men pointing guns at me.  I smiled and pulled out my sword and a dagger in my left hand.  Someone laughed, another commented, "A sword to a gun fight."  

The bullets began firing and I walked through them like butter.  I felt every bullet hit.  I shrugged them off.  I decapitated the first man I reached and gutted the second.  The humans stared at me.  The vampires in the room ran.  I smiled.  

Behind the bar stood Zach, Johnny's Lesser Chevalier.  He hadn't aged a day.  I smiled at him and he tried to run.  I grabbed the back of his shirt and dragged him over the table.  The men began shooting again.  Zach yelled for them to stop.   They didn't.  I took several more bullets in the back.  I raced up the stairs and found Johnny's office.  He and Breeana were sitting peacefully in conversation.  I threw Zach against the wall in front of me and he collapsed to the ground.  I put my sword against Breeana's throat and my dagger at her nose.  "Where are they?"

She stared at me unable to speak.  She licked her lips trying to make herself talk.  "I don't..." I didn't let her finish I cut off her head in one clean moment.  And her body burned at my thought.  I let the fire get out of control.  It caught the couch on fire and started to burn across to the curtains.  Johnny stood against the wall in fear.  "Where are they?"

"I don't know Cari.  I really don't know who you are talking about."  He was lying I could tell.  I reached around his head and I twisted breaking his neck.  I took the two lifeless bodies and I carried them through the shadows to the only place I knew would cut them off from everything they knew and loved - my closet in the wall.
