# Hidden Cache

Behind us the door opened and small slip of a girl glided to me.  She wrapped her arms around me the best she could while I was in Tony's arms.  Tony spoke softly beside my ear to the girl, "Nicky what are you doing here?"

She piped up as if he didn't already know, "To see Cari of course, just like you."  She hugged me tighter.  

I felt Tony's chest rise and fall as he chuckled, "No, I meant right here.  You aren't supposed to be here."

Nicola let go of me and motioned to the man who was scrambling in the door to apologize.  "He was kind enough to let me in."

I smiled and let go of Tony to turn to see the little girl who was tied to my heart.  She was almost as old as I was in terms of years, but she looked 16, she would look that way forever.  

I hugged her.  "Nicola, you know you aren't supposed to do that right."  

Her laughter made the whole room laugh softly to themselves.  I patted her back.  "Is it alright if she stays?"

Aurora and then began.  "Ryan and I unveiled your secret caches."

With my arm around Nicola and Tony's arm around my shoulder I found it very difficult to be angry.  I knew I should be, but I couldn't.  I was being played.  I pulled away from them and I felt the anger rise.  I turned around to the two of them.  I had forgotten they were both relatively strong in Empathy.  I glared at them but turned my cooling anger on Aurora and Ryan.

"I didn't tell you where they were so you could use them, Ryan"  He looked at me wish shame, he stammered to make his case but I didn't let him.  I held up my finger and he knew he had none.

Aurora spoke, she didn't fear my wrath.  "I always wondered how you kept so many places hidden, so many things stashed without breaking a sweat.  She pulled out a plain curtain and smiled, and wrapped herself from head to toe in it.  She spoke from the shadows; no one could see her but me.  "It's so simple."

Henry nearly screamed himself hoarse with excitement.  "Why can't we do that?"

Aurora unveiled, "Because no one knows how to do it except Cari, and she just woke up.  We've only been in possession of the few curtains she used for about a year.  And they are limited in number."

I had a better idea.  I unlatched Nicola's necklace.  I put the latch back together and hid the necklace in the shadows.  I had done it many times before and it vanished in front of their eyes.  I unlatched the chain and it was visible again.  I put it around Nicola's neck and latched her necklace.  She was gone.  Everyone in the room stood up to see the results.  I took the necklace off again, and removed the magic and gave Nicola back her necklace.  "It doesn't have to be major, just a completed circle."

Tony grabbed a piece of straw from the floor and touched the ends together and hid it in the shadows, then pulled it a part.  Everyone was amazed as he crossed and uncrossed the ends of the piece of straw.

Anyone strong enough in shadow started playing with the technique.  "I can maintain many of these."  

Henry looked over at me.  "How many?"  His voice was more than curious, it reminded me of that monkey from a book I'd read once to Johnny.

I shrugged, "I don't know, a couple thousand."

He whistled and everyone looked at me in disbelief.  One of the men I didn't know spoke for the first time in a majorly southern accent, "Your joshin' right?"

Tony laughed, "She rarely joshes."  He laughed harder.

Those that knew me chuckled as well.  Henry looked at me confused, I was not laughing, "I rarely say something that is not true.  Even if you don't like it."

Aurora put an arm around Henry, "She's direct.  She never jokes, well almost never.  If she says she can make a couple thousand necklaces, I'd believe her and between you and me, I think she can do more.  And really I wouldn't want one I made if I could have one she made."

He looked up at her in awe, "But you are the oldest of the Shadow bloodline."

She nodded, "That's how good she is at Shadow."

Henry looked at me, "Then she must be horrible at everything else."

Tony laughed again, this time he fell to the ground in tears.  "Only from a child.  My son I wish you'd known Cari before this, she could have taught you to dance circle around everyone else."  He looked up at me literally and figuratively.

"But she can't even sleep in the ground."  Henry really didn't understand.

Tony was still playing with his piece of straw.  I made it burn.  He dropped it onto his pants, but it only burned the straw, until it was gone.  He looked up at me, "Hey, that was mine."

I smiled down at him.  "Your son needed to see."  I looked at Henry from across the room.  "I cannot manipulate, earth, water or air, but I can manipulate fire.  I go against many things you have been taught.  I can feed on all vampire powers, but I cannot use them all.  I shield myself from all their attacks.  I can ward off the undead but I cannot control them.  My talents are not what anyone expected of me."

He nodded only slightly less confused, "So what else are you strong at?"

"My strongest abilities are in Shadow.  I'm fairly strong in Empathy and Animal Ken, the others I only excel in mainly the defensive areas."

"Except fire."  Henry claimed.

Aurora nodded, "We," she indicated the remaining council members, "believe that her fear of fire, and her first lesson were in conquering her fear allowed her to become strong in fire, whereas all other elements escape her."  Aurora smiled at him, and then turned to me, "She is definitely an odd duck."

Everyone laughed.
