# The Execution

The class filed out behind me with murmurs of greatness of how this would be awesome, they couldn't wait.  Tristan and Tony caught up to me and put their arms around me.  Ant, Ryan and even Alex fell in behind us.  Aurora yelled down the hall, "Cari"

I stopped and turned and the men behind me parted so I could see her.  Aurora bowed nearly to the ground in practiced fluidity.  I returned the bow but to a much lesser extent and turned around and started walking with a smile on my face.  "Never expected that."

"She's respected your skills from the start.  She talked Sal into letting you keep your swords and use them."  I nodded knowing all too well that fight.  I sighed knowing I'd have to kill Sal someday soon.

"How do we turn them to Chevalier?"

Tristan skipped with pleasure. "This way."

He took us into the deepest parts of the compound and lit a torch for his eyes to see.  It caught me off guard.  I blinked in the new brightness.  "Prisoners of War."

I looked at the men tied with their hands behind their backs and what use to be white rags tied around their mouths.  "We've been collecting them."

"We only need one."  I turned to him.  

He nodded, "We are being safer rather than sorry."

"When can we do this?"

"I need to feed then any time after I see the girls."  Tristan smiled brightly at me.  He offered me his wrist.  I smiled at him, then looked at Tony, "Who's gonna handle the schedule?"

"We'll find someone but I'll remember for now."  Tony pushed me towards Tristan.

I pulled him closer to me with his outstretched arm.  He understood what I wanted, he picked me up and I wrapped myself around him then bit into his supple neck.  His knees shook and then he steadied he closed his eyes and hugged me tighter to him.  It wasn't about sex, it was about comfort.

Tony hugged us both and helped me down when I lifted my head.  We had been left by the rest of the family only the prisoners watched.  They watched with horror on their eyes wondering if they were going to be next.  I jumped at them and they all fell backwards. I smiled and left.  Tristan and Tony rolled their eyes at me.  I laughed just a little bit harder.  They laughed.

We walked back to the infirmary, Eve was rocking one of the girls, and a nurse was cuddling another.

She smiled at us as we walked in.  "They've been eating well."

She handed the little one in her arms to Tristan, and picked up her wristband, "Yep.  Morgan."  As if she was reassuring herself she had it right.  The nurse handed Tony Carissa.  Eve pulled up a chair, this didn't look good.

She smiled, "It is okay nothing's wrong.  Though I'm not sure of the ramifications.  They both hold Primeval DNA, which shouldn't be the case as their mother doesn't have any at all.  Carissa is mostly human, but she seems to be linked to her sister like a Chevalier is linked to a vampire."  

Tony nodded, "So Morgan is like Ant."

Eve nodded, "With a Chevalier."

Ant stared at his little sister, "Already showing me up huh?"  he looked over at Carissa, "Lucky duck."

Eve looked up at Tony, "You taking Chevalier?  I'd like to take samples before and after if you are."

"I hadn't thought about it.  I have no one I'd want to be bound to for the rest of my life."

He looked at Tristan, "Expect y'all."

I watched Tony while he thought about it, I said softly, "You're Dad is joining the forces in class.  I think he'll let you slide too.  Take Tristan."

Tony shook his head, "No, you two already work together well.  He told me what went down when you two were alone in the oil refinery.  I don't think we'll have it.  We are too much alike."

I shrugged, "It's the two of yours call."

Alex stepped forward, "I can if you can break this bond we share already.  I was going to become Chevalier anyway, but I'll take up arms with Tony, we've been training as if we were going to be anyway."

"We'll have to ask Dimitri."  And he strode into the room with a grin.

"And Il Cane calls.  Once it was the other way around dear, just remember that."  He rubbed the hair on my head, "Little beauts you have.  What can I do for you?"

Alex answered with conviction.  "Can we undo what I did?"

Dimitri looked at me, "You know better than I do."   He turned to the panther before him, "It'll hurt like hell.  This isn't a lesser bond, it is for life, but it can be undone.  She knows how, she taught me."

Tony and Tristan asked "Why?"

Dimitri frowned, "Edmund wanted to leave me once many years ago.  Cari found something in her research and she taught me how.  But I never did it."

Alex looked at me, "Why did you need to ask him?"

"I'm not an Animal Ken master, I know only what I found.  I can't undo something  I know little about."

"Is she always like that?  So cold and distant."  Alex was almost disgusted.

Tristan nodded, "Yep."  I smiled he was getting the hang of it.

Alex looked at me with relief, he was glad to be gone from my me.  "So do it."

I nodded "Open yourself to your beast.  Just on the verge of turning."

He looked at me, "It won't make me change will it."

"No you'll pass out."  I turned to Tony, "You got me?"

He nodded and handed Ant the baby.  "You and Trist get them out of here, everyone else needs to leave too.  Eve you can stay to look after Alex, but you'll have get him out of here too, she may not be in control."

Alex looked up at me, "What's about to happen?"

Ant had handed Ryan the baby and he was walking out.  "She's about to let lose her evil side."  He turned to me, "I'll help Eve get him out of here."

I nodded and closed my eyes.  I could feel Alex's beast on the edge of turning.  I grabbed what looked like a leash in my mind and I unlocked the cage in my mind and pulled the leash apart from both of them.  It snapped with a pop that only I could hear.  I raced to lock the door but I was too late the anger and the blood lust rose to a deafening crescendo.

I could hear doors slamming and I could hear only one heart beat in front of me.  Tony stood ready to take me down.  I scrambled in my mind to tether the beast inside me.  I pulled with all my might.  I dragged the beast by the fur.  Fur?  I pulled it until I could push it back.  I pushed and I pushed and the door slammed shut.  I collapsed to my knees.

Tony didn't know what to do.  He stared at me until I passed out.

I woke in the infirmary with little ones lying on my chest; I tried not to stir too much for fear of them falling off.  Tristan put a hand on one and Tony the other.  Tony looked at me as he helped me sit up so I could cradle both the girls.  

Tristan smiled, "You started to wake up the moment they touched you."

Tony looked concerned, "What the hell was that?"

I shook my head.  "I didn't want to hurt you.  I fought the beast instead."

He blinked at me, "And it worked?"

"Apparently.  How long have I been out?"  I asked, it didn't feel like long.

"Only for a few minutes.  The girls started crying and the only thing that would make them stop was being closer to you.  We laid them down and you woke up."  Tristan laughed, "Talk about the touch of a parent."

"Alex okay?"

Eve peaked around the curtain, "He's fine doll, though I think he reneged on being part of ya'll."

"That's okay."  

Tristan patted Tony's arm, "We can do it.  Me and you.  She's enough people in her head."

"You sure?"  Tristan nodded.  "Cari?"

I found the place in my mind and kissed Tristan good-bye and the link was gone.  He stepped back, "Damn that was easier than I thought."

I smiled and Eve looked on with relief, "So it'll be that easy."

I nodded, "Without the kiss, of course."

She laughed, "I could have dealt with that." 

Tony smiled at Tristan, "You still wanna feed her?"

Tristan smiled, "Of course, that cool."

Tony laughed, "I would be feeding on you for anything more than pleasure anyway."  Tristan blushed, Tony laughed.

Tony smiled, "Two down.  Four more to go."

Eve looked at them, "Keep them human.  We found she went into withdrawl on Therian blood when she was pregnant."  

"Good to know.  I can do the rest if everyone is ready."

Everyone looked to Eve, "You heard the woman." she smiled.

I handed the girls to their fathers and they started to whimper softly.  Tristan sighed, "They won't let us hold them right now."  

I smiled and pulled together a sheet on the next bed and made a make shift sling for two.  I took Carissa from Tony and placed her on the left, and Morgan on the right.  I made sure my sword hand was free the sword easily freed of the bindings and smiled.

Tony and Tristan nodded, "There we go.  Babies to go."  Tristan laughed at Tony's joke.

We all gathered together in the prisoner's room.  I drew the symbols needed on the floor and Tony and Tristan lifted the prisoners into the circle as instructed.  

I looked over at the crowd; it was large for being so few of us.  "Vampires make lesser chevalier."  The room was full of their magic.  Moments later the magic faded and the men sneered up at me.  Vampires touch me then stand behind me."  They made a line and did as instructed.  When the line was finished, "The rest of you say, 'And with you I give my soul.  Bind me forever with my master as you pass unto death.' Then touch a man at my feet."  

Tristan was first, "Spread it out people, let's be smart about it."

"Everyone done?"  No one said anything just nodded their heads.  I looked down at the men before me and drew my sword.  "And with your deaths I bind thee."  In one motion, the five heads fell from their bodies.  Their blood spread across the symbols on the ground the magic bubbled and then it was done.  An army of Chevalier.
