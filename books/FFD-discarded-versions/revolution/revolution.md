# The Phone Call

It was the early morning on the second of September almost nine hundred and three years after my birth.  The year was 2001, it was a year full of earthquakes, new presidents, space adventures and executions, and the year was not over yet.  A thunderstorm billowed on the New York City horizon as if it were foreshadowing some great doom to plague the land. It was a beautiful sight; my pale reflection was the only thing marring the view in the plate glass window.  

Nick Shaffer, our contact and currently my lover walked up behind me and wrapped his arms around me, kissed my shoulder and whispered in my ear, "When you coming back to bed?"

Muttering to myself, "We've been here too long."  The storm on the horizon seemed more like a personal warning than it did anything of major proportion.  Superstitions in my family ran high. The Big Apple was a fine city but we had been here too long.  Staying in one place was rare for me, but this time there was Nick.  Nick's past wasn't one of great importance, but he was an addict.  Not only had he gotten himself hooked on drugs and alcohol, but his latest addiction was an addiction no human could ever think to break him of, he had been addicted to vampire blood.  

In history humans who drank vampire blood for any length of time became what we called a ghoul - man who thirsted for vampire blood would make him do anything and everything possible for one more drop of our precious blood.  Vampires use to slaughter ghouls on sight, until we found a better way to return them to society.  Withdrawal was hard, but if done properly could be done for life.  My family and I had remained in the big city to finish weaning Nick off of vampire blood.  It had been done for nearly a month and yet we had stayed.  We had nowhere else to be, so our roots began to sink in with very little effort on our part.

Nick ran his fingers playfully down his fingers over the scar that ran from my left shoulder blade down my back to my right buttock check.  "That wasn't what I asked."  Nick sang playfully in my ear, "When you coming back to bed?"  

A knock sounded before I could respond to Nicks tender touch. Ryan called out, "Cari, you have a phone call.  It's important."

I could feel Nick's sigh against my cheek as I answered, "Come in."

Nick hurried to the bed and climbed in, he was still shy about his nudity.  Ryan opened the door and quickly shut it when he saw I was standing there in the buff.  He didn't blush; he had after all seen me naked many times before.  He grinned at Nick; I could feel his glee in embarrassing Nick radiate through our bond.  I shook my head, "Who is it?"

Ryan pressed a button on the phone and spoke into the air, "Aurora, Cari is here."

On the other side of the phone it was easy to recognize the soft, silky voice that was Aurora Dejesus, one of the council members in Europe, "Cari don't come when Sal calls."

Before I could ask "What?" the phone was dead.  Ryan looked down at me with confusion, it was a very weird call.  

Ryan frowned, "She said she was in Dangdburgh.  Why is she here?"

Another knock came from the door; Allison did not wait to be let in.  She came in with a phone to her ear, "Yes Sal, I'm in the same room as she is now.  But it hardly matters."

Sal's voice was loud and clear despite not being on speaker phone, one of the perks of being a vampire.  "We have a job.  I need her here in Dangdburgh. Immediately!"  He sounded anxious.

Allison nodded, "Yes sir.  We will be there in about a day, and that's traveling around the clock."

Sal muttered something to someone on the other side.  It wasn't intelligible, like he knew I was listening.  "Fine!  Just get her here soon, it's important!"  Allison hung up the phone without even so much as a good-bye.  But Sal could go on for hours impressing upon us how important it was that we be there, thusly delaying our departure.

Ryan looked at me with concern, "You going?"

Allison looked at Ryan with confusion, "Why wouldn't she?"

He smiled at her but the light was not there when he did, "Aurora told Cari not to come when Sal called."

Allison stared at me, it was odd to get conflicting orders, something bad was on the horizon, and the thunderstorm on its way in to the city was far from the worst of it, I could feel it in my bones.

Nick laughed from the bed he was hiding in, "She'll go.  Honor, Duty and Obligation demand it."

Ryan laughed with him.  Allison blushed when she realized Nick was lying naked in my bed.  She stammered an apology, "I'm sorry, I didn't realize.  I'll go start packing."  I rolled my eyes; she was still relatively new to our family, though some would say twenty years is plenty long.

Ryan gave me a kiss on the check, "I hope you know what you are doing."  And then he too left.

I muttered to myself, "I hope so too."  

The sheets from the bed flew off and Nick was hastily getting dressed, "I suppose I'll go now, since you are leaving."  He looked up at me with a fear on his face, "When will I see you again?"

I sat behind him on the bed where he pulled his pants on and wrapped my arms around his chest and whispered in his ear, "I don't know, but you don't need me anymore."  Though it was probably a lie, I feared he'd traded his blood addiction for another - me.  "But I'm sure we'll see each other again, I don't know when but we will."  Nick rubbed his face against my cheek then finished getting dressed.

# Packing

Nick pulled his shirt over his head then sat down on the bed in front of me and kissed me softly on the lips.  I smiled up at him as I had to do with almost everyone else in my life.  He smiled back but there was sorrow in his eyes and I could feel it radiate from him.  He was also an empath, a unique one at that, Nick could see a person's connections to others in a given area.  It was one of the reasons why he'd turned to drugs and alcohol in the first place.  He couldn't tune anyone else out.  I taught him how and now he was in a much better place, he really didn't need me, even if he felt he did.  

I leaned in and kissed Nick again then whispered to him, "You'll be okay."  Then I remembered the business cards Alison had made.  I leaned over to the pouch I typically worn on my waist instead of a purse or anything of today's world, I relied on the belt pouches of my day.  The business cards were nothing fancy, just the company name and my phone number.  I handed one to Nick, you can call anytime.  

He laughed at me, "You won't answer the damn thing though."

I smiled, "No, but Alison or Ryan will and we'll work out something."  He looked doubtful.  "I promise."  As if those two words meant more to him than anything in the world, he light up like a Christmas tree.

With a smile and a passionate kiss good-bye Nick left and I was alone to do what was required of me.  Normally packing wasn't a big deal, but we had been here too long and things had started to find homes in our rooms.  My clothes were all hung in the closet with care.  My swords were stored neatly in a chest of drawers under several layers of blankets.  It had been a sad day when one of the cleaning boys severed his finger while playing with one of my swords.  Sadly we have never stayed at that place again, but it was hardly a big loss.

Packing was done rather quickly; vampire speed does come in handy.  But then again I had very few possessions with me, most of my belongings were at my estate in Dangdburgh where Mia kept tabs on them and managed the estate itself.

Mia like Ryan meant a great deal to me, they had been with me for eight hundred and twenty-three years.  Their lives were tied to mine; they were my chevalier - guardians during the daylight hours; rather that is what chevalier are to most vampires.  To me, Mia and Ryan were much more than guardians; they were two of a group of humans whom I feed on.

Unlike most vampires I did not hunt my food.  I was serviced by a small group of humans who came with me where ever I went.  Ryan and Mia were only two of the group that history had started calling Il Mandria della Cane, loosely translated to The Hound's Herd.  Allison and five others were part of my extended family; most had been with me for decades, some even centuries.  Allison was the most recent addition to our group, but not by much.

It was a good idea to help the others finish their packing.  Allison was the most likely to have not dented her collection of things.  She was a typical woman.  I knocked on her door and she grinned when she saw my one bag behind me.  "I see you are done.  Good you can help pack the paperwork."

I rolled my eyes.  Of all the people in the world who I could have chosen to help me with managing our day to day business it had to be a pack-rat.  But even though I disliked the wasted paper and tediousness of fulfilling everything Allison wanted, she was probably the best assistant I had ever had.  Allison kept our lives as streamlined as possible.

The desk with all the paper on it was a mess.  Maps and bills and various other pieces of paper were strewn all over the place.  It would take a while just to get them in order.  Allison had given me the job I most hated.  But I was here to help and that was what I was going to do.  

Allison carried on a one sided conversation.  I really had no idea what she was talking about, but then again she could have been talking on the phone.  Phones were getting smaller and Allison like Jack always seemed to have a new one.  I had one but Allison carried it.  I hate almost all technology.  I grew up simple and that was how I preferred it.

Allison turned to see what I was doing, she giggled, "My! That's the best the table has ever looked."  She came over to me and wrapped her arms around my neck, "That's all the help I need, the rest is easy to do.  Maybe Jack could use some help?  We are in a hurry after all."

It sounded like she wanted to get rid of me, and I was more than willing to oblige her of that.  I was betting she was having a conversation with her would be lover Larry.  

Jack's room was across the hall from Allison.  We each had our own room, it was easier that way. Seven of us sharing a room was not good.  The door to Jack's room opened without my knocking, Jack Wynn was a computer god in my eyes.  He had been a hacker, but we had turned his talents to our benefits.  He still got to be bad in the eyes of the law, but he had the safety of numbers now.  Jack looked down at me with puppy eyes.  "Not coming to play are you?"

I shook my head.  Of all the men in my life, Jack was the only one I was never allowed to be alone with.  Jack left the door wide open as I came in.  He had packed up all his personal belongings except for the electronics that were scattered across the room.  Jack had two or three laptops, a few cell phones, a pager and various other small bits and bobs lying around.  I asked, "Is there anything I can help with?"

Jack's eyes said it all, he wanted to play.  I smiled at Jack but stayed away from him, "I'm sorry we don't have time."  The sorry in Jacks face didn't reach his eyes, he was just playing.  Jack was a masochist.  He enjoyed pain; he was by far the oddest of my extended family.  But for all his oddities compared to the others, Jack and I got on rather well, as long as we didn't play the game Jack so loved.  

I couldn't even feed from Jack alone.  Each member of my herd was compensated in various ways, I rarely compensated with sex, but for Jack I made an exception, because what Jack wanted was to be hurt.  While I did pay him, it was icing on the cake for Jack.  He was more than happy if when I feed on him I made it hurt.  This didn't bother me any but then again I also enjoyed inflicting pain upon others, or myself for that matter.  We could not take the chance that Jack or I would not give up the safe word to save our own lives.  

Jack kissed my arm softly, "I'm good here.  Move along before we get in trouble."

It was easy to forget the stakes when with Jack, he was a sweet man and very cute but I left, he was right we couldn't risk it.

There was very little left to do, I felt useless.  Larry and Doc were packing away their few belongings and were chatting away as they helped each other.  Larry grinned when he saw me standing in the door way to his room, "Bored sweety?"

I nodded and he grinned, "I have a joke for you."  Larry's taste in jokes were almost as bad as his taste in women.  But that wasn't saying much for Allison then, they seemed to be having a fling these past few months.  I hoped they were happy, it was rare I took a female companion with so many men.  It always made things easier.

Larry looked across at me with a hurt face but his smile in his eyes told me he was just making fun of me.  I seemed to be the butt of many jokes for him.  With a pout Larry asked me, "Did you think it was funny?"

I just nodded my head as I watched Doc put the handguns in their cases.  "Been practicing?" 

Doc looked up with surprise, "Oh, yeah, we went yesterday.  You should come with us one day.  We all have a bet if you could best Ryan or Ant."

All the men in my family all had gun permits, most of them had them in almost every state we had ever visited.  They all enjoyed their firearms.  I preferred my blades.  I shook my head and Doc nodded, "Ant said you'd say that."

Ryan walked up behind me and I felt his presence long before he put his arm around me as he flipped his phone shut, "Ant said he'd meet us in Dangdburgh."

I nodded.  Ant was my son.  He was out and about doing his own thing for the past few months since we'd stayed in New York City.  He was even more restless than I was.  

We had everything together and in the RV before the hour was out.  We were all ready to go see what the council had in store for us. 

# The Dance Club

It took us 20 hours to get to Dangdburgh, and I had worried the whole way there.  The weather was a drastic difference.  New York was humid, but getting out of the air conditioned RV was like hitting an invisible wall.  I hated the South in the late summer.  We got out into a large parking lot outside of what looked like a large warehouse, but with a large neon sign blinking "Frozen" in ice blue lettering.  From the line wrapping around the corner it looked like a very popular dance club.

I could feel that those standing in line were both human and vampire.  The Council was inside and my only childe vampire was inside as well.  It had been many years since I'd spoken to Alistair.  But it hadn't been long enough for me to fume over the last conversation we had before he left.  I still hadn't forgiven him for his words.  I didn't care that he left; he called me a monster, and less than a vampire.  I saved his life, not once, but twice and that was what he thought of me.  I hated him for it.

Ryan tapped me on the shoulder.  "Coming?"

I sighed and spoke softly, "Alistair is in there."  

He nodded, "He owns the joint."

Great! Just what I needed, but I started walking again.  By the time I reached the velvet ropes barring our passage the others had already gone in.  The man, no the vampire bouncer, held out his arm in front of me.  "No weapons allowed."

I did a double take.  I really wasn't in the mood and my voice showed it, "What?"

"Owner wrote here, No weapons allowed next to your name.  You are Cari, correct?"  I nodded.  "You can hand them over to me and I'll make sure they get back to you."

"I don't have any on me."

He laughed.  "Johnny said you'd say that.  Please just take them off."

I was getting angrier and my pulse was racing.  My voice was gravelly and quiet.  "I will not!  Unless you intend to explain yourself to The Council, then let me in."

He backed up, "I'm sorry I can't."

Ryan put his hand on my arm.  "Come on Cari just give up the weapons."

I pushed Ryan, probably harder than I had meant, "I will not!"

Ryan saw the fury in my eyes, and heard the cold in my voice.  He pushed me back hard enough to move me away from the crowd.  He continued to push until we were in the middle of the parking lot before he tried to talk to me again.  But I had nothing left in me for words.  I drew my sword and I attacked Ryan.  He had no choice but to defend himself.  I don't think I would have killed him, but I know he would have killed me if he had to.  I don't know how long we fought; the clang of the swords was the only thing that mattered.  It was no longer about the argument at hand; it was about the fight - the life and death of the sword.  

Things happened quickly.  I don't know what happened first.  I don't know if Alistair had stepped in the middle of the fight, or if I was being held by my arms tighter than anything I could imagine first.  A familiar presence was behind me but I didn't fully understand in the heat of the fight.  I fought against the arms that held me.  

"Calm down."  And with the words calmness washed over me.  Just from those words I knew exactly who was holding me and I tried not to melt, the anger helped in that way, I did all I could to calm the anger but Alistair just enraged me further.

I didn't hear most of what Alistair yelled at me, "For the love of all things, what the hell is this about?"

I glared back at him and my anger started to rise again.  I started struggling against the man's arms again.  "Back off Johnny.  She has to calm down.  Unless you want to die that is."  My body would have melted into the body that held me, but my fury was too powerful.  All I wanted to do was kill Alistair right now.

Johnny and Alistair were one and the same but I had forgotten that Alistair went by Johnny now.  It was always hard to remember.  The mere thought of his name made the anger stir inside me.  

Johnny directed his attention to the man holding me, "Tony, you back off.  This is my place.  She will not bring weapons into my home."

Tony put his face next to my ear, it couldn't be comfortable, but he whispered, "Calm down.  It's okay.  Deep breath."  

If it had been anyone else it would have been patronizing, but Tony had always had that effect on me, I could feel the anger leaving.  Tony looked up to Johnny.  "She won't.  I promise, but ... Back. Off."  The threat in Tony's voice made my hackles rise but Tony rubbed my arms while still holding tightly on to me.

Johnny left in a flurry and Tony let me go.  I was about to yell at him about the weapons, but he held up my sword belt with sword in his right hand and the daggers in his left.  He smiled at me.  I was angry again.  I threw a punch but Ryan caught my hand before landing.  He laughed, "She's been cooped up too long." 

I turned to glare at Ryan, but the anger was gone.  It wasn't worth it.  I sighed and started for the velvet ropes.  The men exchanged looks.  I ignored them as I walked past the rope and bouncer who was holding the rope as far from me as he could.  He wanted no part of me.  I didn't blame him.

I walked into the darkness of the club and almost all eyes turned to look at me.  Shit!  I grabbed at my metaphysical shields and clapped them shut.  My anger had opened a gaping hole and now all the vampires in the club stared at me.  Tony put his arm around my shoulder and with his help the overwhelming power was contained and the crowd went back to their own business - all except for those in front of us.  They seemed to part like Moses parting the Red Sea.  They didn't even know they were doing it.  I looked up at Tony and he was smiling.  He was enjoying using his power to impress me.

We reached the stairs and another thought hit me and I threw Tony's arm from shoulders.  He looked at me confused.  I glared at him and then climbed the stairs two at a time.  I heard Ryan behind me tell Tony, "She's afraid the Council will kill the both of you for seeing each other."  I didn't hear Tony's reply, but it didn't matter, I was staring at the door the council was behind.  The whole council was on this side of the ocean and in one room.  It had not happened since I had been created!

# The Meeting

Ryan and Tony had caught up to me.  They watched me stare at the door.  I was immovable.  I was petrified to go in that door.  Ryan must have felt the tension, he put his arm around my shoulder and leaned in to whisper, "It'll be okay.  Let's go find out what they want."

I reached for the door handle, but the door opened before I could turn it.  Aurora smiled at me, but it didn't reach her eyes.  Something was seriously wrong.  She moved out of the way with her arm extended as a welcoming jester.

I walked in, Ryan and Tony behind me, no one else had followed us up the stairs.  Not even Johnny.  Tony joined his father.  The room was full of the most powerful vampires in the entire world.  It was not a good sign.

Sal, my typical council contact, started the meeting.  "Welcome Cari.  I know you know Francesco.  I'll let him make the proper introductions."  He stepped back and Francesco took his place.

Francesco smiled at me.  We had not seen each other in many centuries.  "This here is Charles Dennis, our prime minister."  The prime minister was in his early forties with salt and pepper hair that he pulled off well.  "And you know my son.  Antonio."

I interrupted, "Tony."

He smiled at me with knowing eyes.  When Tony and I had first met, Tony was only ten years old.  He informed me his name was 'Tony' and continued to spell it 'T O N Y' in a very condescending fashion. I couldn't help but smile back.  Francesco continued, "Yes.  He is if you'll pardon the coincidence, our Enforcer.  We are here to discuss a problem that plagues all vampires and humans a-like."

Sal stepped forward again on cue.  "We have a problem.  And these are your objectives."  Sal laid down a picture of a man I vaguely remembered seeing before somewhere.

Francesco spoke calmly.  "This is Brandon Holt, my brother."  There was a pause punctuation by stunned silence from the rest of the room.  He picked up quickly as if trying to explain, but he didn't, "You need to kill him.  Tony will help you, though your council seems to believe you can do it without his help.  But he is our problem, and Tony needs your help."

Sal laid down a second picture.  I clearly recognized him; Valence Dilanti was an Enforcer like me.  "You need to kill him."  The third picture Sal laid down made me stare at him in confusion.

Every eye in the room was down cast, no one wanted to look at me, nor the picture of me lying on the table.  "You need to kill her."

I stood there in stunned silence.  Ryan's hand was on his sword.  Aurora stood up and looked at me, "Is there no other way?"  She addressed the room, not me specifically.  

At least one person was on my side.  Sal glared at his wife.  "No, she's gone rogue once before, we cannot risk it again."

A rage filled my soul, but my voice was quiet, cold and distant, "I've not killed ONE human in over eight hundred years."

Sal turned his glare to me.  "These are your orders.  This is not a negotiation."

I don't know what came over me - fury, rage, and hatred, maybe all of them.  "Fine!  You want me gone.  I will go but I will not kill anyone either."  And with that I stepped into the shadows and left them staring at where I use to stand.  I didn't care where I went, I just stepped from shadow to shadow.  I let the anger take me where ever it would.  I could feel Ryan drawing closer.   Someone was pulling him towards me through the shadows.  I blocked every connection to me.  I clamped my shields shut tighter than I ever had in my entire life.

I walked in the shadows until near dawn.  My final step was into a grand forest deep in the Rocky Mountains, in the shadows stood a girl of about sixteen.  She smiled at me.  "Mother said you were coming.  I didn't believe her.  How could anyone appear in the shadows?  But here you are."

"Is it here?"  It was cryptic, but she nodded, "Take me to it please."  I reached out with all my power and set up wards, no one would find me without losing themselves first.

She offered me her hand and I took it.  I felt a calmness wash over me as her magic added to my shields.  "It will protect us both I think."  She smiled.  "My name is Ayeshea, but you can call me Thea.  What can I call you?"

"Cari."  

Her smile widened.  "We are here.  She put her hands on a round stone, and a hidden door opened."  A whoosh of air flooded inside the room, the room was dark but Thea raised her hands and four torches lit the darkness in an eerie glow.  A coffin sat in the middle directly under a skylight.  "Quickly it will be daylight."

I got in the coffin and Thea put an IV in my arm and checked the connections. I turned to her, "In ten years send message to Tony Giovanni and bring him here."  Thea nodded and I laid back and pulled the lid shut.  It was heavy; the silver lining it matched the lining of body itself.  It would keep me in and vampires out.  Once the lid was shut it locked on the outside and I heard Thea attach the padlock to it.  I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.  I was dead to the world!

# The Nightmare

At first my undead sleep was calm.  I relished the peace, the quiet, the blissful solitude that the torpor brought with it.  It was not a complete torpor for me.  I'd learned over the centuries that after years of not feeding my blood lust would be nearly uncontrollable.  The IV feed me a continuous but slow stream of blood.  The pulse of the IV kept me on the edge of a full torpor but never going over.

I dreamt of the time I went rogue.  The killing played in my head over and over again.  I could feel their bodied in my arms, taste their blood and feel their throats rip from their bodies as I ravaged their town.  I saw Nicola's face in my mind as I fed on her.  I felt her pulse slip from me as I dropped her on the ground.  I left the child's body intact.  I don't know why I had, but I was glad of it now.  

Nicola appeared alive and well in my dream.  She asked, "Where are you?"  I knew it wasn't real.  We had no connection of any sort; it was just a make-shift family we had created as a punishment for killing her family and friends.

My dream switched to something not of my own memories.  I saw planes flying into skyscrapers - The Twin Towers in New York City to be exact.  The towers fell in a mass of chaos and devastation.  

Images of destruction flickered through my mind.  First it was only The Twin Towers.  Then soon all of Manhattan lay in ruin.  A large mushroom cloud rose above the ruins that had once been one of the greatest cities in the world.  

The images flickered to Washington, DC.  The White House was in shambles, and the Washington Monument was felled like timber in a logging camp.  Lincoln's head lay decapitated from his body and the rest of the monument was a mound of rubble.

Fires and explosions scorched the earth around the country. Everything that separated America from a third world nation was destroyed - oil refineries, power plants, dams, military bases and much more.

My dream changed again. Masses of people ran and shouted.  Men and women fell to an unknown pursuer.  Some were trampled; others were helped up only to be shot from behind.  Searing pain shot through my body and then blackness.  I thought the dream was over.  I relaxed but as soon as I sighed my insides felt like they were on fire.

And then the pain changed and seconds later it was another pain.  The pain never left.  I couldn't sleep.  I pounded on the silver lining of the coffin above me for someone to let me out.  My hands burned at the mere touch of the silver.  I screamed, "Let me out."

My voice grew hoarse, I stopped screaming.  I stopped fighting.  I could do nothing but feel the pain.  I tried to enjoy the pain like so many other times before, but it was not mine.  I tried to force my mind into the quietness, but I could never reach it.  It was almost there and then the pain would be strong than it had been moments before.

There was nothing but the pain, it went on and on without pause.  Time was irrelevant, it didn't matter if it was day or night, everything blurred together and all I thought about was the pain.  

I heard the latch moving on the outside.  It startled me.  I started to shake, my body hurt.  I couldn't think straight.  I cringed against the silver lined walls, burning my skin.  I pulled away as the lid was lifted off and fell to the ground with a great thud.  My body was a mass of raw nerves I could hardly move but I could feel others there.  

# Awakening

Voices above me were familiar but I couldn't hear them.  I felt hands on my shoulders.  I screamed and fought the hands that touched me.  Someone pinned me to the padding.  I could feel someone's breath on my neck.  He.  Yes it was a he, he whispered in my ear.  "Calm down.  It's okay.  Deep breath."  My mind wanted to relax, but the dreams were still running through my mind.  I opened my eyes to see a fall of dark hair blocking my view.  The scent of the man holding me was familiar, it was almost calming.  But even though my eyes were open I could see the nightmares.  I fought against the man holding me.  He held me down, but he was no longer leaning in to me.  I heard him, "Something's wrong.  How long has she been like this."

A woman behind the man spoke softly, "We've heard her screams nearly since she got here."

He turned to her letting go of my shoulders.  I jolted and scrambled out of the coffin.  Why was I in a coffin?  The man turned to catch me but he missed, "And how long has she been here?"

"Almost twelve years."  Her voice was tinged with fear.

Anger crackled in his voice, but he didn't yell, "Why didn't you get her out?"

I watched them through the fall of my own dark hair in the corner.

She stepped up to the man with no more fear, "For one I could not lift the lid."  She put her hands on her hips and tapped her foot impatiently, "And second, she ordered us to leave her in for ten years and then come find you.  That is exactly what we did."

He looked over at me and then back at the woman.  "So you follow her? Blindly?"

She smiled, "No different than you or her own Chevalier.  My family has been entrusted with her care.  I trust her to know the consequences of her actions and my lack of them considering the circumstances."

Another man in the doorway laughed, "I remember this."  He looked over at me cringing in the corner.  "It wasn't supposed to do that though."

The first man looked over at the other, "What is it?"

The second man's grin grew wider, "It's a capsule to keep Cari safe when she slept.  It's meant to hide her, and it did its job.  Until this moment I couldn't pin point her, now I feel her.  She lost her control.  She's afraid.  I'm surprised you can breathe with the thickness of her powers in the room.  I can't feel them out here.  She shielded the room.  Precautions on top of precautions.  I don't think she intended this to happen."  He waved his hand at me and I scurried back into the wall, but there was nowhere else to go.

A small woman brushed passed the second man in the door way.  She walked towards me.  I tried to bury myself in the wall but I fell through.  I landed on my back startled.  I was in the darkness outside the room.  How?

I heard voices coming from every direction.  I didn't have any time before three men were surrounding me.  I looked up at them in amazement.  The men above me were not smiling except one and his grin was as wide as the moon above.  He knelt down at my head.  "You've never been able to do that before."  He reached out for me and I whimpered.  "It's okay.  I'm just going to help you stand."  He held out his hand and waited.

I studied his upside down face.  I could feel memories tugging at me through the nightmares.  The face was always there in my memories.  A man from behind the ring around me spoke, "She's trying to place you, Ryan."

Ryan... "Ryan Elliott," my voice was hoarse still, my throat felt raw, saying his name out loud unclouded memories.  I knew who he was.  I knew the man who had tried to hold me down as well.  I looked up at him towering above me on my back.  The strongest memory flooded my mind.  "T O N Y".  I smiled.  A vision of a little boy stood in my mind next to the grown man next to me.  He smiled.  And I took Ryan's hand.  He pulled me up but I stumbled and fell.  My legs were weak.  

Tony caught me and scooped me up in his arms, my body quaked in his arms but I melted into him.  I felt whole for the first time since I went to sleep.  The men took me to a small hut just the other side of where I fell through the wall.  My mind was fuzzy and I believed Ryan when he said I'd never done that before, though I couldn't remember what I had done.

The other man who had stood above me smiled at me as we walked through the door way.  "I'm David. David West.  I found your boys here."  He smiled at me with his bright green eyes.  A different kind of power radiated off of him.  I didn't know what it was but it felt primal but not.  Once we were in the room, Tony sat me down in a chair.  

Tony motioned for the man who had helped me recall Ryan's name to come over.  The man smiled, Tony introduced him.  "This is my friend Tristan Marshall, he's an empath and he seems to read you like a book."

He held out his hand, but I didn't take it.  But he smiled, "She's a bit lost.  I take it this isn't normal."

Tony laughed; it was a golden sound to my ears.  "Not even close."

Tristan's smile turned to concern, "She's in a lot of pain."

Tony frowned and it saddened my heart, "She always is."

Tristan took a step back, "Seriously, this is a shit ton of pain.  You can read me right."  Then he took a second look at Tony, "Wait, why can't you tell yourself?"

Ryan answered before Tony could.  "Apparently the only blocks still intact are the ones connected to the lot of us."

I watched and listened to them talk about me like I wasn't there.  But Ryan's words were like a knife cutting through my mind.  The nightmares became real again, the pain made me scream out.  I wanted to say something, but I couldn't make the words come out.  All I could do was scream.  I grabbed Tristan's arm and he fell away from me with a pained look on his face.

Tony pried my grip from Tristan's arm.  Tristan moved closer and grabbed me and pulled me off the chair into his lap and wrapped his arms around me and pulled me as close to his body as he could.  He wrapped me in calmness.  I could feel him trying to comfort me.  

Tony look a moment to process and he put his arms around me and Tristan, more calmness seeped into my body.  I could feel Tristan's heartbeat, it pulsed against me.   It was alluring.  I was hungry.  I tried to pull away from them, struggled to get away from them.  But they pulled and pushed at me, their bodies pressing against me as I fought them.  Tristan's heart was the only thing I could hear, my own pulse beat with his.  I pushed at Tristan, he had to get away from me.  A stab to my chest, or rather that's what it felt like pushed my hunger over the edge.  I thought I was going to bite into the pulse of the large vein that had been there only moments ago, but instead I sank my fangs into a wrist.  I knew the moment I tasted the cooper liquid that Tony had anticipated my move.  I drank his life blood, his living vampire blood raced through me.  I drank for what seemed like forever.

I withdrew from Tony's wrist with blood on my lips.  I felt more myself with his blood coursing through my veins.  I looked over at the man who had tried to calm me.  He smiled at me without any fear in his eyes.  I smiled back.  He asked me, "Can you tell them now?"

I only nodded, afraid to speak.  I got up and eased myself back into the chair.  My strength was returning now after I'd fed, my legs no longer felt weak.  

I started to speak,  but only a squeak came out.  Tristan smiled harder at me encouragingly.  I tried again.  My voice was gravelly but soft, and the words came out in a croak, "Where is everyone else?"

Tony asked, "Who?"  Before I could answer he quickly added, "Oh, you mean your family, your friends, the ones you left at Frozen?"  He sounded angry, angry at me.  I was confused.  He spoke in an abrupt voice, "They're dead!"  He got up and stalked out of the room.

I tried to grab for his arm, but he was too fast, or I was too slow, either way he was gone before he could hear my ask, "Are you sure?"

"They were captured; we assumed them dead when we couldn't find them."  That was Ryan from the back of the room, "Only Mia and myself are left."

I looked around to see Mia sitting at Ryan's left.  She smiled at me and then left the room.  She made herself busy, I could feel her happily moving through the hut we were in.  I could feel Ryan.  I opened myself to Tony and I knew he was sulking out in the woods.  I searched for the others, and I found them.  They were hiding in plain sight, in my nightmares.  I could feel their ragged bodies hanging.  I could feel their weak pulses.  I spoke slowly and carefully so my voice didn't squeak again, "They aren't dead.  They are being tortured.  Not one of them is dead."  I sank into the chair their pain was raw in my body.  I could feel their pain.  It had been their pain that had ravaged my body while I slept.

Ryan got up out of his chair, but Tristan was there first.  "She's right; I saw them in my mind when she grabbed me.  I don't know where they are, but they are alive."  Tristan put his hand on my arm.  "It's okay we'll find them."

Ryan shook his head, "She won't be able to wait until then if we can't get her shield back up.  Whatever is happening has broken her shields."  

A woman who had been in the background the whole time, the woman who was first with me when I woke up, she spoke softly, "I can help her.  I've been taught how to help her."

Ryan looked at her, "Thea are you sure?  You've never done this before have you."

She smiled at him, "I did when she got here."  She laid her hands on me and I could feel the shields rebuilding in my mind.  The pain subsided with each brick she laid.  "It won't be as strong until she can re-forge the link with her friends, but she should be stable."  There was no doubt in her voice.  I felt better too.

# A Bit Of History

Before long I was ready to walk around, to get a hold of my new surroundings.  I didn't want to meet any more people.  I didn't want to be around anyone actually.  They let me go.  As I walked out the door Thea touched my arm and spoke softly, "There are wards set up, it's safe to walk on the insides, you can feel them if you pay attention.  Don't go outside them."  I nodded and I think I remembered helping with the wards before I slept.  But the memories were still hazy.  Everything but the nightmares were hazy.  I could still see them when I closed my eyes.  I wouldn't be sleeping anytime soon.

The moon was low on the horizon, it was still early yet.  The notion made me smile, early for a vampire that was.  I looked up and saw stars and more stars.  The last night sky I had watched was cloudy and light from the lightning flashing from a distance.  Images of the Twin Towers standing and then fallen flashed through my eyes.  I saw the Statue of Liberty standing and then fallen and her grand head missing.  I blinked at the night sky trying to regain reality.  I walked into the woods to clear my head.

I walked until I found a small running creek.  I stopped and stared at the water babbling over the rocks.  It was peaceful.  A voice whispered from the other side of a large conifer tree.  "Of course we'd agree on a peaceful setting."  Tony walked around the tree through the creek then sat on a fallen log near me.  He watched the water, he didn't look at me.  So I continued to watch the water as well.

We stared in silence.  I listened to the crickets chirping on the night wind.  Toads croaked their own chorus.  It was nature's symphony.  Tony broke the silence, "I'm sorry about earlier."

I turned to look at him.  I could see him as clearly as if we were standing in a well light room.  I probably saw him better now in the dark.  He was as gorgeous as I remembered him being centuries before.  "Sorry about what?"

He looked up at me with sorrow, "For saying what I did back there."

It was my turn to be snarky.  "Oh, you don't mean when The Council condemned me to death by my own hand."

He got up to leave and I wasn't going to stop him I didn't really want to be around people.  I turned to watch the creek again.  The symphony no longer played in the night air.  It was quiet.  Too quiet.  I turned to look for a predator, but there was nothing around, I could feel no animals near, only Tony and myself.  He was still standing there, but he'd turned to watch me.  He spoke softly, "About that too.  I should have warned you."

I turned to him, "You mean you knew before I did."  I should have been angrier than I was.

He sighed, "Yeah.  If you didn't kill yourself I was ordered to kill you."  He looked pained at saying the words.

I sank to the ground in pain.  My own pain, my own memories, which was a far cry less painful than what I'd just endured.  But it hurt none-the-less.  Tony's voice grew even quieter, "But it doesn't matter now.  Nothing is as it was."

"You mean the Towers fell and the White House is destroyed."  I was being sarcastic.

He knelt beside me and looked at me as if he were studying me, to catch me in a lie, "How did you know that?"

I stood up quickly, and Tony fell back startled.  "I was being sarcastic."  I had raised my voice more than I had intended to, a critter scurried out from under the bush near us and ran in the opposite direction.

Tony stood up and grabbed my arms and shook me, "The Twin Towers did fall.  DC is gone.  The US of A is no longer a functioning nation."  Tony shook me harder.  "And it's YOUR fault."

I threw his arms off me in a blast of strength I didn't know I had.  He fell backwards and I grabbed for the sword that should have been at my waist, but there was nothing there and I looked a fool.  I searched around the area but I didn't find my sword.  Where was my sword?

I looked up and found Tony staring at me.  "You really have been asleep all these years."

I fought back the anger that was rising up in me.  It was bringing surging memories of the night I'd fled the council.  My nightmares flooded my memories.  I sank to the ground again, almost in tears.  "I dreamt of that night."

Tony stared at me from above with knowing eyes.  

"Not the night I left, the night I killed that town."  Tony's eyes softened.  "I saw their faces.  I felt their hearts beating, their pulses fade, and their throats in my hands as ripped them out."

Tony knelt down beside me.  "I'm sorry."

"Not your fault.  But that was only the beginning.  I saw planes crash into the Twin Towers.  I saw the mushroom cloud above Manhattan.  I saw the destruction of DC.  I dreamt all of it.  And you are telling me it all happened?"  I was saddened; the history of this great nation was gone.

Tony nodded, "That was the start of the war with The New Order."

Tony paused and we sat in silence.  He looked back at me, "If you had killed them, we wouldn't be here now."  He wasn't talking about this time and this place, he meant in this situation.  He blamed me for it.  I don't think I blamed him either.  Hind sight is always 20/20.  

"And I'd be dead."  I stood up and started to walk away.  

Tony grabbed my arm.  "I'm sorry.  I am.  But while you slept, your friends died.  My family turned against me."  I turned to look at Tony, a tear slide down his tanned cheek.  It was covered in soot, or something, the tear streaked the grim on his face.  I wiped it away.  

"Turned against you?"  I wasn't sure what he meant by that.  There were so many holes to fill.

He gave me a faint smile but it didn't last long as he told me the New Order storming Dangdburgh.  "Once the human government was overthrown, The New Order came to Dangdburgh.  They came to kill the Council and the Elder Circle.  They had intended to take them out first, but when they found out you had gone missing, they did the weakest link first."  He tried to hide his anger at me. "We were all at your estate when they came for us."

"The humans in the city ran as the army of undead and human alike marched on it.  Your Lessers tried to negotiate with them.  Their terms were simple surrender or die.  "

"Sal and Charles tried to get us all to surrender, but only half of your council did; only Charles did on our side of the leadership.  Sierra and China opted to survive than to fight with the rest of us."  

"The rest of us gathered together in a room waiting to be stormed by our own friends and family until my son, you remember Henry? Until Henry popped out of the room through a growing shadow.  He came back the same way with a grin so wide we all started laughing; it was his first shadow walk.  We all took hands and we popped from shadow to shadow until we didn't know where we were.  We all tightened our shields and hoped they didn't come for us.  We were safe for the time being."

"A short time later we met Tristan, and we trained the resistance the best we could."  He smiled at me. "Why didn't you tell me about him?"

I knew exactly who he was talking about, his son, Anthony Giovanni, the second.  "I wasn't supposed to see you again when I found out I was with child."

"How?" Tony asked with so much naivety that I laughed.

"You know damn well how?"

He grinned, "You know what I mean."

"I don't know.  I guess I'm more like you than anyone ever thought."

Tony put his arm around me and sat down on the damp sand, "My dad knew.  Or suspected anyway, that's why he helped to create you."  He leaned into my ear and whispered, "And why he introduced us."

I smiled then I blushed as I felt his breath on my neck.    I closed my eyes and enjoyed the closeness.  I missed it.  My heart ached for Tony.  He pulled away from me and my heart sank, he'd fallen in love with Sierra, I knew that.  I knew he loved her and I had let it be.  I couldn't have been with him anyway, he was happy.  But now my heart ached.

He took a deep breath and continued his story, "We've been fighting them under the banner of The Coalition of Humans and Supernatural Beings."  He laughed, "Most people call it the CHSB - the name's really long."

Tony gestured behind us.  "When your furry friend found us we were retreating from a failed mission against one of their units."

"My furry friend?"  I was confused.

He laughed, "David West.  There are actually several here.  You've been eating them mostly."  He pulled the IV from my arm.  I had forgotten it was there.

"Eating them?"  It sounded worse that it really was, but it made Tony smile and it was worth the bit of uncharacteristic effort it took for me to make a joke.  

"Ha ha, funny.  You know what I mean."  I nodded and smiled.  "It's good to see you smile.  You need it.  But back to the point, it appears that this is a Therian sanctuary of sorts.  Dimitri was surprised when David told him where you were.  He and Edmund had been here on and off for the past twelve years."

I lowered my gaze in morning.  Edmund had been more than a friend when I trained with Dimitri.  

"We've all lost people.  I'm sorry about your family, Cari."

"My family?"  I was confused, before realizing Tony wasn't there when I told everyone else.    "They aren't dead."

Before I could finish what I was going to say Tony interrupted me, "They were captured."  He turned his face from me.

I reached out and turned his face to me.  "They aren't dead.  They were captured.  They are alive, if you can call what they are living."  I paused, he looked at me we sorrow mixed with anger.  He didn't believe me.  I put both my hands on his face and opened my mind to him.  The nightmares and memories flooded into Tony so he could see and feel and believe me.   He pulled away from me in horror.

Tony backed away from me in a crab crawl looking at me like I had done those things.  He backed into a tree trunk and stopped with a startled look on his face.  He stared at me while he processed the information.  I had nothing more to say, but I waited for him to understand.

My arm started to burn, the smell of burning flesh always made me wretch in disgust.  It took me several seconds before I realized my skin was burning.  The sun was already above the horizon, but the thick canopy of trees kept most of the sun out.  I couldn't stay here.  I tried to focus on Tony, but he was already standing before me covering the sun spot with his hand.  

"We can't move in to town here.  I already tried."  Tony looked around frantically for some place I could stay.

# The Place Between Worlds

I put my hand free hand on his other arm and I stepped into the shadow of the trees and walked out between the worlds.  It was no place special really but it was the only place in the entire town that was in the shadows no matter what time of day.  It was protected by human and vampire magic.  If a vampire stepped into the circle from the shadows and continued to walk they would be burnt alive.  And there was no stopping it.  Tony began to walk and I grabbed his arms.  "No."  He stopped but looked at me for an explanation.  "If you step more outside the circle you'll perish."

Tony looked down.  "I don't see a circle."

I smiled, "Of course not, it would be a dead giveaway.  Just wait here.  Someone will come once they are sure we mean them no harm."  The call of birds unknown carried through the town, first close and then farther away.  It was a signal, one that was rarely every issued.  "They will come."

Tony looked down at my arm and held it up at an awkward angle.  I pulled it away from him and wrapped both arms around his waist.  "I'm fine.  Just stand still."  I put my head on his chest, it felt natural and Tony wrapped his arms around me and put his cheek against the top of my head.  We held each other and waited.  I couldn't go anywhere even if I had wanted to.  The sun was everywhere and there was little shadow even in this place between worlds.  

In one direction lay the room I had been kept in.  The sun was beaming down into the room bathing the coffin in radiant light.  To the other direction lay town, there was about five feet of shadow here that was protected with the magic, but moving too far from your entry point was your demise.  We waited for an uncountable amount of time before Thea came running.  "I'm so sorry."  She apologized profusely.  She reached the edge of the shadow and waved her hand and muttered a few verses in a language I had not heard in many years.  

"I'm afraid you are stuck there until sundown.  We have nothing to offer of sufficient protection."  I nodded and tried to sit down against the wall behind us.  Tony grabbed my arm before I could.  Thea laughed, "You can move.  She can't leave the shadows for the sun."

Tony relaxed slightly and let go of my arm.  I sat down with my back against the wall.  I looked up at Tony, "You can move now."  He turned to look down at me and smiled.  It was an alluring smile and I knew exactly what he was thinking.  What man wouldn't?  He turned around and sat down next to me.  

"I guess I can keep you company."  Tony put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me next to him.  I laid my head on his shoulder.

Thea looked down at me.  "Can you protect the shadows until you can find shade?"

I nodded then frowned, "I'd do better with my weapons."

Thea nodded and walked back towards the cabins in the woods.  It really was a nice place - quiet and peaceful.  Moments later Ryan walked out of the hut Thea had gone into.  He carried a bundle in his arms towards us.  He smiled at me and shook Tony's hand.  "Good to have you back in one piece."

Tony laughed, "Afraid some beastie got me?"

Ryan handed me the bundle in his arms.  "No, not really.  Not unless you consider our friend here a beastie."

Tony smiled as Ryan sat down in front of us, "She tried to kill me, but her sword was not there."

Ryan sighed, "Probably for the best with her current mood and all."  He kicked at my foot playfully.

I looked down at my bare feet.  It had been a very interesting day and I was still wearing the same close I had when I'd gone to sleep twelve years ago.  "It's been twelve years?"  I asked making sure I'd heard them right before.

Ryan nodded.  

"It took two years to find you," I glanced at Tony, "It's that bad?"

Tony nodded and looked away.  Ryan sighed, "Give him time."

"Whatever.  I didn't do anything."

Tony glared at me, "That's the point.  You didn't DO anything."

I stood up and Tony did the same, we stood toe to toe.  My anger rose, Tony's anger filled me.  "It's not my fault you killed your family."

Tony pushed me and I could feel the sun's rays on my exposed skin.  The pain only fueled the anger as I threw a fist at Tony's face.  He caught it effortlessly, I brought my left around to jab him in the gut and he caught it too.  I tried to pull away from him but he held me close.  "Calm down, Cari.  Calm down."

I didn't want to calm down.  I wanted to hurt him.  I was tired of being blamed for things.  

Ryan pushed me and Tony pulled me back deeper into the shadows.  He spoke calmly, "Cari, you need to get out of the sun."

I hadn't realized I was burning, but the moment I stepped into the shadows my skin started to heal.  I pulled my hands from Tony and fell back into Ryan.  

Tony glared at me then calmly spoke, "I'm going to go home."  He stepped into the shadows and was gone.

I slide down Ryan's body and crawled to the wall in the deepest part of the shadows and curled up in the fetal position.  Ryan started to say something, but I interrupted him, "Just go.  Leave me alone."  As an afterthought I added, "please."

I put my forehead against my knees and felt Ryan walk away.  I was alone but I still wasn't happy.  I sat in the shadows as the world passed me by.  I saw a shadow join me, but I didn't look up.  

I was surprised to hear Tristan, "You need to sleep."

I looked up and only saw his silhouette.  "I can't.  I see it when I close my eyes.  And I feel Tony's rage and my heart breaks."

Tristan grabbed my hands and pulled me to my feet.  He turned me around and wrapped his arms around me before he put his back against the wall he was standing nearest too and slide down with me still in his arms.  I let him.  He was radiating calm and I really didn't want to fight it.  I put my head against his chest.  

"Close your eyes and sleep.  I'll keep you safe from your dreams.  I can give you that at least.  I can't do anything about Tony.  But I will tell you that he loves you, he never stopped.  Just give him time."  Tristan started singing softly and I closed my eyes.  It didn't take long before I was in total silence in the place between worlds.

# Reunions

My dreams were quiet.  But I woke to a ravenous hunger in human arms.  I could feel his heart beat beneath my head; I could feel the pulse in his wrists.  He let go of me, but not too quickly.   He whispered, "Its okay."  He offered me his wrist.

I turned to see who had been holding me.  I was surprised to see Tristan he was fragile I didn't want to hurt him. 

I was about to stop when someone stepped out of the shadows and fell over us, halting my feeding, a young man who was the spitting image of Francesco.

The man's grin grew wider and I smiled across at him, "You look like your grandfather."

He smiled and got up.  "I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to fall on you."  He looked over at Tristan and frowned, "Dad's in a foul mood.  I thought you were coming after some secret weapon?"

I started to get up and Henry offered me his hand.  I took it, I didn't need it but he was being polite.  I looked down at Tristan and offered him my hand, "A secret weapon?"

Tristan smiled at me sheepishly and took my hand to help him stand.  "Yeah, we did.  He's upset that we found the secret weapon."

"Seriously, you are going to keep talking like I don't exist?"    I didn't liked being talked about like an object much less like I wasn't there.

Henry looked at me confused.  He looked so much like his father it nearly broke my heart.  Tristan laughed, "Henry, meet Cari..."

Tristan didn't have a chance to finish his sentence before Henry landed a right hook in my face.  "I was ten when my Dad was forced to kill my mom and sister.  You could have stopped it."  Tristan tried to stop him but Henry was too strong and too fast.  I let the lad beat on me.  I blocked my face for any other incoming blows.  Henry began to tire I could feel it in his bows.  But out of the shadows a pair of vampires stepped into view.  

It felt like they were larger than life, towering above us all, but that was not the case.  I recognized them at a glance and their magic ceased to work on me, Francesco and his wife Marie when together could be pull off the illusion they had just done.  Marie hadn't stayed in the shadows.  She glanced at her grandson hitting me and walked away.  Francesco put a hand on the boy's shoulder and pulled him back.  I only relaxed my guard slightly.

"Henry, go find your grandmother." He listened without hesitation.

Tristan was nursing a scuffed elbow.  He'd fallen against the rock door frame.

I looked up at Francesco, "It seems the whole family hates me."  I sighed and sank back to the ground.  I could leave, it was well past sunset, but this place just felt safer.  I curled back up and rested my forehead on my knees.

"No, child, only they do.  Marie and I believe you did the right thing.  You didn't know what was going to happen.  We couldn't do anything to save you.  We tried.  And they don't hate you, they just need someone to blame."  Francesco always sounded so wise.

"When we found Henry was gone, we followed him."

I looked up.  "I need to return this spot back to its safety.  Too many people are coming here."  I knew someone bad would be next.  I stooped up.  "If you are brining others Thea can tell you where a clearing is that will work for your purposes, but this needs to be sealed again.  Do not come again here."

Tristan clarified.  "She means to this specific spot.  It's a weakness right now.  When she and Tony came in they took the barrier down or we'd have lost them both."

Francesco smiled and stepped out of the circle.  I placed my base ward; it would keep anyone in or out until Thea could raise the barrier again.  I looked at the place between worlds and wished I could go back into the safety of the shadows.  I sighed and then my anger rose inside me.  I was angry at myself.  I hated being weak.  I hated feeling like this.  

Marie and Henry came out of the hut I had been taken to the prior day.  Marie smiled at me, "We will bring the rest of your friends here while you gain your feet again.  Thea told us where to go.  She said she'd be out to raise the barrier soon.  She also told me you needed to eat again."

I nodded.  

I left the confines of the town and back into the woods.  It was more comforting than the people around me.  I found myself back at the babbling creek.  I fell to my knees and felt tears falling from my eyes. I cried for a long time.

Hours must have passed before I felt someone coming.  I didn't feel like straightening myself.  They could just leave me be, but the crying had faded.

As soon as he was within range the wind changed I caught the safe scent of Tony wafting my direction.  My heart sank.  I didn't want to fight again.

He stood behind me and I tried to ignore him.  We listened to the babbling creek in silence.

Tony was the first to break the silence.  "I knew I'd find you here.  I'm sorry about Henry.  He didn't hurt you did he?"

"He's just coming into his powers, he did fine, but I'm okay."  I tried hard not to sound like I had been crying.

"I forget you raised one of us.  Ant must have been a handful."  

I sat up and turned around and sat on the damp sand.  I didn't look up at Tony I just shrugged.  I had nothing to compare it too.  

"Aurora wants to see you."  I looked up at him; I knew there was a ‘but' coming.  "But she wants to tell the full story to everyone.  My father agrees upon his secret, but we have to agree to share ours as well."  He looked neither happy nor sad about the situation.  I guess there wasn't much they could do about it now anyway.  

I held up my hand to Tony.  "Full disclosure is not a bad thing."

Tony took my hand and helped me up.  He pulled me in close and whispered.  "I'm sorry.  I don't like fighting with you like this."  I stepped back so I could see his face, he was smiling.

"I'm sorry too.  Sorry for everything that's happened."  He wrapped my arms around his body and put my head against his chest.  I felt more at peace than I had in a very long time.  He held me tight before he lifted my chin to kiss me.  It was a tentative kiss at first, and then the passion grew.  I melted into his arms things were going places we hadn't been in centuries.

But I got the nagging call from the council.  I pulled away from Tony, "Aurora's calling."  

Tony mumbled, "She can wait" as he kissed me deeper.

I wanted to do as he said, but she'd been nagging at me for the past ten minutes.    I pulled away breathless, I tried to talk but Tony tried to kiss me again, all I could get out was "ten minutes, ruins the mood."

Tony pulled away with a frown but there was a smile in his eyes.  "If we must."  He licked his lips and I wanted to kiss him, instead I took his hand and started walking back to town.

Halfway there we met Ant, he exclaimed, "Thank God!  I didn't want to have to stop you two now that you stopped fighting."  Tony punched Ant in the shoulder.  "Ow."  He smiled.  Then Ant looked at me with a grin.  He grabbed me and wrapped his arms around me and spun me around in a great big bear hug.  "I missed you."

I laughed; he was still very much a child when it came to me.  He put me down.  "Nicola can't wait to see you either."

Ant threw his arm around my shoulder and Tony and I walked hand in hand back into the small town that had half the council waited.  I wondered which half.

# A Half Of The Whole

We let Ant lead the way, even though it really wasn't necessary.  I could find the council without trying too hard. We walked slowly, even Ant didn't want to get where we were going quickly. I think he was enjoying having two parents at the same time. There was an extra skip in his step. I smiled. Tony caught my mood and swatted Ant in the head playfully. "You are making your Mum here wish for days we never had."

I elbowed Tony but I didn't mean it.  He was probably right.  We wound up at what could only be called a long hall.  It was a large building that held only one room, their meeting hall.  Table chairs were lined along the wall, but there was a large round table in the middle of the room.  At the table sat many faces I knew and others I didn't.

I, of course, saw Aurora.

On Aurora's right sat Francesco, his hand was next to Aurora's on the table, but no one seemed to notice but me. Marie sat next to him and Henry next to her. Henry spoke with Tristan. Ryan sat next to Tristan. There was an empty seat next to Ryan that Ant took when he had entered with us.

There were two empty seast between Thea and Ant.  Tony sat down next to Ant.  I waited for the final seat to fill.   But everyone turned to look at me.  The room was sitting in silence.  Aurora laughed, "She's not use to being in this situation."  She got up from her seat with a casual caress of Francesco's shoulder, she came to stand beside me.  She put her arm around my waist and directed me to the chair.  "Sit, dear one.  This is not a council meeting."  I did as she said, but she was right this was foreign territory for me.

Aurora walked back to her chair but she didn't sit, she stood behind it, with her hands on the back of the chair.  "In this room sits some of the most power people in the world."  She let her words sink in.  She smiled, "Like the Knights in Arthur's Court, we sit in a circle, none having more power than any other at this table.  We are the leaders, our people follow."  I was no leader; I pushed back my chair to stand up.  Aurora looked at me and I stayed put but I didn't pull my chair closer.  I was wary.  "We each lead in our own way.  Some of us take up arms against the foe.  Others of us sit in the background making plans.  And yet others keep us safely hidden so that we way may live to fight another day."

"Yesterday we may have found a key to winning the war.  But before we get to that, we need to lay all our cards on the table.  No more secrets among us, but we will not judge.  Who would like to speak first?"

Aurora sat down, and Francesco stood up as if they had been practicing for hours. He looked at me. "I conspired to add new blood to my people. I gave the former council of vampires the key to making their Enforcers. The first was a success. The second was not so great." He smiled, "Though Cari got off to a rocky start, I never expected to have the sane one end up the rotten egg." He took a deep breathe. "I introduced my son to Cari in hopes of adding a new element to our blood line. My dream has since died." I was surprised, to hear that, didn't he know about Ant?

Aurora stood up next to Francesco and took his arm.  She looked at each of in turn.  "Francesco and I have been seeing each other for nearly 800 years."  I nodded.  I was of few who had seen their relationship in its infancy.  She looked at me and then Tony, "Anyone else?"

They sat down and I looked at Tony.  But it was Thea who stood up next.  "In the sake of honesty, I did not believe vampires were not monsters.  My mother told me to believe and I would see the truth.  When Cari came to me for help, I was startled.  But she didn't step out and kill me.  I know now that vampires are much more like their human kin than anyone had ever known.  Some are savage but others, "she looked at me, "others can be safe." 

Ryan laughed but quickly stifled it.  "No offense, but Cari is far from safe."

Thea nodded her head, "I know.  I've seen her dreams.  I've looked into her soul and seen the darkness.  I've seen the blood on her hands.  But I see honor and loyalty.  I feel safe."

Ryan nodded in agreement.  Thea sat down.  

No one stood up; everyone looked down at the table, except for those that had spoken.

Tony stood up, pulling me to my feet.  He looked at his father and mother, "Father, Mother, you believe we can only mate with one."  They nodded.  Tony looked down at Ant, he smiled and stood up.  "I'd like you introduce you to our son."  He pulled me closer to him, "Anthony Giovanni the Second."  

Marie stood up, "That's impossible you mated with Sierra".

Tony shook his head.  "No Mother, I mated first with Cari.  When the council forbade us to be together I sought another to fill the void.  I fell in love with Sierra, but I have always loved Cari."

I spoke quietly, "I assure you, he is Tony's son."

Aurora cleared her throat.  "Finish!  Unveil all."

At the command I removed my personal shadow as did Tony.  On our right arms was a tattoo of a thick thorny vine.  Thea nearly fainted.  But she caught herself and stood up.  "May I explain?"  Tony and I both nodded.

"My many centuries gone my great grandmother wed these two with living magic.  She tied their souls together."  She tilted her head in askance, not sure if that was right.  "I guess that would be right, since a vampire's soul is not gone.  Where one soul goes, the other will follow.  Death, life, heaven hell, whatever you believe in.  They are tied together.  The vine thickens with the years, it grows stronger.  The thorns grow sharper and longer to protect its precious fruit.  This is the strongest vine I have ever seen."  She looked up at us in awe.

Aurora stood up, "They aren't done yet.  I know they've given us many questions but there is more."

I shook my head, I wasn't about to tell them the last secret.  Tony looked at me, and pulled me close.  "She won't tell, and I can't go against her wishes.  But in all fairness to the group, Aurora will speak for us."

Aurora sighed but nodded, "We all know vampires take Chevalier.  But Cari found the process to make it permanent.  What we call Chevalier are not Chevalier, but Lesser Chevalier, they are only partially bound to us with the possibility to leave at any time."

Ryan stood up, "I'll finish, it's my secret as well."

Aurora smiled and sat down, she was glad.  Ryan moved to stand with his arm around my shoulder.  "Cari bound our soul to a human, and she sent them all to hell when she killed a murderer."  All eyes were on us.  "My soul, Mia's, Tony's and Cari's were bound to that man who had killed a girl in front of us."  

There was a gasp in the room, someone whispered, "That's impossible."

Aurora spoke over the whispers, "I am certain that what they have done is unbreakable.  I have found the book Cari used.  And despite what we think, vampires can become Chevalier to another.  You kill one of those four and they will all die."  

There was silence in the room.  No one moved, it was as if everyone was holding their breath.

Henry broke the silence, "So we've been sending Tony and Ryan into battle knowing we could have killed Il Cane della Morte, the one person who could have prevented this war, and who can potentially stop it.  You tried to kill our only weapon against them."

It was my turn and I was fighting back the rage inside me.  I stood up nearly flinging my chair across the room.  "This is not my fault I pointed across the table at the former council.  "They were going to kill me, by my own hand.  I could not kill your father.  I could not kill my friends."  I turned and tried to leave the room, but Tony grabbed my hand and pulled me back to him.  I turned and buried my face in his chest and cried.

There was stunned silence as I cried openly.  Tony turned to the room, "We left her friends to die.  We left her family in the hands of the enemy.   They live still.  They have been tortured every day for the past twelve years.  It drove Cari to the insanity we saw in her when we first woke her.  She's fighting her beast and the nightmares.  She can't control everything.  She is only a half of the whole.  We need to fix this or the weapon we hoped is gone for good."

I looked up at Tony.  He stared down at me with tears in his eyes.  He mouthed, "I'm sorry."  And I returned the gesture.

# Hidden Cache

Behind us the door opened and small slip of a girl glided to me.  She wrapped her arms around me the best she could while I was in Tony's arms.  Tony spoke softly beside my ear to the girl, "Nicky what are you doing here?"

She piped up as if he didn't already know, "To see Cari of course, just like you."  She hugged me tighter.  

I felt Tony's chest rise and fall as he chuckled, "No, I meant right here.  You aren't supposed to be here."

Nicola let go of me and motioned to the man who was scrambling in the door to apologize.  "He was kind enough to let me in."

I smiled and let go of Tony to turn to see the little girl who was tied to my heart.  She was almost as old as I was in terms of years, but she looked 16, she would look that way forever.  

I hugged her.  "Nicola, you know you aren't supposed to do that right."  

Her laughter made the whole room laugh softly to themselves.  I patted her back.  "Is it alright if she stays?"

Aurora and then began.  "Ryan and I unveiled your secret caches."

With my arm around Nicola and Tony's arm around my shoulder I found it very difficult to be angry.  I knew I should be, but I couldn't.  I was being played.  I pulled away from them and I felt the anger rise.  I turned around to the two of them.  I had forgotten they were both relatively strong in Empathy.  I glared at them but turned my cooling anger on Aurora and Ryan.

"I didn't tell you where they were so you could use them, Ryan"  He looked at me wish shame, he stammered to make his case but I didn't let him.  I held up my finger and he knew he had none.

Aurora spoke, she didn't fear my wrath.  "I always wondered how you kept so many places hidden, so many things stashed without breaking a sweat.  She pulled out a plain curtain and smiled, and wrapped herself from head to toe in it.  She spoke from the shadows; no one could see her but me.  "It's so simple."

Henry nearly screamed himself hoarse with excitement.  "Why can't we do that?"

Aurora unveiled, "Because no one knows how to do it except Cari, and she just woke up.  We've only been in possession of the few curtains she used for about a year.  And they are limited in number."

I had a better idea.  I unlatched Nicola's necklace.  I put the latch back together and hid the necklace in the shadows.  I had done it many times before and it vanished in front of their eyes.  I unlatched the chain and it was visible again.  I put it around Nicola's neck and latched her necklace.  She was gone.  Everyone in the room stood up to see the results.  I took the necklace off again, and removed the magic and gave Nicola back her necklace.  "It doesn't have to be major, just a completed circle."

Tony grabbed a piece of straw from the floor and touched the ends together and hid it in the shadows, then pulled it a part.  Everyone was amazed as he crossed and uncrossed the ends of the piece of straw.

Anyone strong enough in shadow started playing with the technique.  "I can maintain many of these."  

Henry looked over at me.  "How many?"  His voice was more than curious, it reminded me of that monkey from a book I'd read once to Johnny.

I shrugged, "I don't know, a couple thousand."

He whistled and everyone looked at me in disbelief.  One of the men I didn't know spoke for the first time in a majorly southern accent, "Your joshin' right?"

Tony laughed, "She rarely joshes."  He laughed harder.

Those that knew me chuckled as well.  Henry looked at me confused, I was not laughing, "I rarely say something that is not true.  Even if you don't like it."

Aurora put an arm around Henry, "She's direct.  She never jokes, well almost never.  If she says she can make a couple thousand necklaces, I'd believe her and between you and me, I think she can do more.  And really I wouldn't want one I made if I could have one she made."

He looked up at her in awe, "But you are the oldest of the Shadow bloodline."

She nodded, "That's how good she is at Shadow."

Henry looked at me, "Then she must be horrible at everything else."

Tony laughed again, this time he fell to the ground in tears.  "Only from a child.  My son I wish you'd known Cari before this, she could have taught you to dance circle around everyone else."  He looked up at me literally and figuratively.

"But she can't even sleep in the ground."  Henry really didn't understand.

Tony was still playing with his piece of straw.  I made it burn.  He dropped it onto his pants, but it only burned the straw, until it was gone.  He looked up at me, "Hey, that was mine."

I smiled down at him.  "Your son needed to see."  I looked at Henry from across the room.  "I cannot manipulate, earth, water or air, but I can manipulate fire.  I go against many things you have been taught.  I can feed on all vampire powers, but I cannot use them all.  I shield myself from all their attacks.  I can ward off the undead but I cannot control them.  My talents are not what anyone expected of me."

He nodded only slightly less confused, "So what else are you strong at?"

"My strongest abilities are in Shadow.  I'm fairly strong in Empathy and Animal Ken, the others I only excel in mainly the defensive areas."

"Except fire."  Henry claimed.

Aurora nodded, "We," she indicated the remaining council members, "believe that her fear of fire, and her first lesson were in conquering her fear allowed her to become strong in fire, whereas all other elements escape her."  Aurora smiled at him, and then turned to me, "She is definitely an odd duck."

Everyone laughed.

# New Alliances

Everyone was excited about their new discovery. Tony and Tristan were already plotting and planning with Henry hovering close. The former council members were in deep conversation with Francesco and Marie. Thea was in council with David West and the three other men I did not know. It was about time I introduced myself.

Nicola had clung to my hand since she'd gotten there.  She looked up at me in a very adult way, "Tony and Tristan call them your furry friends."  

I sighed. The nick name was disrespectful, were we his undead friends? One of the men saw me coming and smiled. I could feel the power of their disease radiating from the lot of them. Therians were just as powerful as a vampire, but their power  was a disease that many believe could be cured. Doc was one of the few doctors who was willing to try. The thought of my Lessers made me sink to my knees. Their torture was still going on. I lay in a ball on the floor with their nightmares becoming my reality again. The next thing I remember was a mass of bodies around me.  Thea was at my head, comforting me in a way that a mother comforts a child.  She spoke softly to me, "You need to feed more."  A pair of arms scooped me up.  I was too tired to protect.  The moment I was in his arms, I knew it was Tony.  He held me close to his body and took me to another cabin in the woods.  The windows were all covered in thick material, no light could enter.  He set me down on the bed.  "You need to feed."  He held his wrist to me and I looked up at him with concern.  He rarely offered to feed me when there were humans around.  

"Your father and mother would be appalled if I did."  I turned away from him.  I stared at the wall.

"They already know.  They don't understand why I would, or why you would, but they know."   I didn't roll over, I don't know why it wasn't comforting to have me close, but I wanted him to go away.  He felt my mood, he always did, but he stayed, he lay down beside me and wrapped his arms around me and pulled me close to him.  My body reacted to him like no other.  Every muscle in my body relaxed, my mind soothed.  The beast and the nightmares went still and I basked in the quietness.  He put his wrist next to my mouth, and without thinking I bit.  I drank until I was full.  And when I was done Tony held me, he didn't let me go until the following evening.

When I woke still in Tony's arms I thought something was wrong, did I take too much?  When I sat up and looked at Tony he was awake and watching me.  He smiled, "I'm fine."  

"There is a line outside.  You need to feed.  They are all willing to feed you.  Eat Cari, until you are full, until you can drink no more."  Tony sat up and kissed me on the forehead.  "They are offering themselves to you.  Do not harm them."

Tony got up and opened the door.  The first in line was a man I did not know.  He was at the meeting, but I didn't know his name.  He walked past Tony with a smile.  He held out his arm and sat down on the edge of the bed.

I started at his face.  I felt his power; I was drawn to his power.  "What are you?"

He looked down at me in confusion, "A Therian."  My expression spoke a thousand words, "Oh, you mean what type?"  He smiled.  "I'm a blank panther; to be specific I'm a jaguar."

I nodded, "Feline.  I've never met one before.  I've only ever met one of you, he was a wolf."  I touched his arm and it felt like little electrical sparks jumping between the two of us.  "You've been feeding me the most haven't you?"

He smiled, "How did you know?"

I ran my hand down his arm;   I edged closer and touched his chest.  I looked up and saw Tony watching me.  "Go get Dimitri."  Tony didn't hesitate.

The man looked at me with concern, "Why's he getting The Beast King?"

I turned to look at him instead of through him.  "Your power calls to me.  It hurts to touch you, but I can't help myself.  Dimitri will understand."

"Dimitri will just say I'm your beast's flavor."  He smiled, "You explained it like ice cream when I told him I was drawn to you.  Why I felt the need to feed you, to give you my power."  

I touched his chest again.  It wasn't what I wanted.  I moved closer, I lifted his shirt and my hand touched his bare chest.  His eyes closed.  I smiled.  "You feel it now."  He tried to speak but he couldn't he nodded instead.  He took off his shirt and pushed me to the bed.  He kissed me deeply.  It hurt.  The touching hurt, not the kiss itself.  His power called to mine.  It felt like electrical shocks jumping between our bodies.  He pulled back with a yelp.

I looked up at him, "I don't think that's a good idea, if you don't like pain."

When he sat back up I wrapped my arms around his neck, he sat up but he untangled my arms from his neck.  "I can't."  

I quickly grabbed his arm and pulled it to my mouth.  I bit softly into his wrist.  I was surprised there were no physical sparks showing.  I feed on his power.  I feed on his life blood.  I drank just short of too long, even for one of his kind.  But I felt better.  I felt glorious.

When I looked up Dimitri was standing there, but his eyes were on my Therian friend.  "Alex, you okay?"   When he nodded Dimitri turned to me with anger in his eyes.  "You have no idea what you did to him."

"I didn't do anything Dimitri.  I fed on him, that's it."

Dimitri helped Alex up and then he threw me against the wall.  "Not now, before!"

"I've never met him before now."

Dimitri looked confused, he looked over at Alex and when Alex nodded his confirmation he turned back to me.  "You've taken an animal to call Cari, without his consent, without his knowing."

"How could I do that if I never met him?"

Thea walked into the room, "That's probably my fault.  Alex gave her his blood straight from his body, as soon as I found out he stopped, but that must have done something."

Dimitri looked at Alex.  Alex looked down.  "You did this.  Then you will finish it, or you'll both pay.  It's really no wonder why she's in as much pain as she is, a raw unfinished connection draining her powers."  Dimitri snatched my arm and held it to the man in front of me.  "Take part of the woman you nearly killed."

Alex looked up in confusion.  Tony pushed him gently to me.  "He means drink her blood, finish the tie.  You'll both feel better, trust me."

I tried to pull my hand from Dimitri but he held strong.  Alex looked at Dimitri with fear.  Dimitri was going to confront him.  "Finish it"

"Your power is intoxicating to her.  She'll never be whole without this.  We need her whole."  Dimitri's voice was humming in a quiet white rage.  His anger made mine boil.

I growled, "Just do it so I can go."  The beast inside me was rising.  

Dimitri looked at Alex in panic; I could see the fear in their eyes.  I felt their fear.  Dimitri pulled Alex closer, "Do it now, or we'll never calm her down."

Alex bit into my wrist and the pain shot through me like a silver bullet.  He sucked softly and drank freely for a second then pulled away wiping his mouth and running out of the room.

Dimitri looked at Tony.  Tony only nodded and Dimitri dropped my arm and closed the door behind him.  I could hear bolts being drawn.  Tony looked at me and I stared back at him through the blood haze.  

"Calm."

"I don't want to be calm."  

Tony smiled, "You want to fight?"

I looked through him at the door behind him and then back at him.  "No."

"What do you want?"  He asked, as if he'd have the answer.  "You want the cat back?"

I snarled.  He laughed, "You want to hurt the cat."

I took a step closer to him.  He smiled.  "You can hurt me, or try to."  I looked at the door behind him.  "You aren't getting out of here without going through me."  I turned my attention to him again.  "It may have been a long time ago, but I can handle you."

Tony used his powers, he radiated peace and calm throughout the room.  I couldn't step in any direction without it bathing me in its pink light.  Tony smiled, "You want to be enraged.  You don't want to be at peace."  He was concerned.  A light went off in his eyes.  He stepped slowly towards me and I backed away.  There was only so far I could go before I ran into the wall.  Tony still stepped to me.  "Calm Cari."   He reached his hand out to me and I swatted it away.  He reached again after another step; I continued to bat at his hand.  He stepped and reached until he could touch me, until he had me pinned against the wall.  "I won't let you die."

I looked up at him, "Why not?  You hate me."  I tried to push and squirm out of his grasp.  But he held me tight against the wall.  I growled at him.

He leaned in to me, pain in his eyes.  "I don't hate you.  I hate what happened.  But I don't hate you."  He leaned in closer; I could feel his breathe on my skin.  "Don't make me do it Cari."

I looked up at him.  His face was so close, I could kiss him.  "Do what?"  It was a taunt.  

Tony pulled me and then slammed me into the wall. "You want me to hurt you?"

My eyes rolled in the back of my head.  Tony let go of me, still as close as he had been.  "I won't hurt you again."

I growled and punched him in the stomach and kneed him in the chin as he doubled over.  I ran for the door.  But Tony was faster.  "No I don't think so."  He grabbed my shoulders and slammed me into the wall.  

The room was too small, the walls were too thin.  We pushed back and forth until the think plaster gave way.  The longer we went on the less cautious we were, the more it came to be about survival.  We fought inside the tiny room, the ceiling shaking, the light fixtures rattled above us.  Plaster fell from the ceiling.  

I used all my strength and threw Tony, he crashed through the wall, the way was finally clear.  Tony lay stunned in the other room, but Ryan stood in the path.  I saw Tony stand up behind him.  I only had eyes for him.  I looked through Ryan.  Tony moved the human from his path with gentle guidance.  Neither of them was going to let me out of that room.  I growled in frustration.

I heard talking in the other room.  "Why are we letting them kill each other?" It was the voice of a boy with concerns over his father.  I looked up at Tony and the rage faded, I let the pink calming light in.  I gave up.  I dropped to my knees and I cried.

Tony towered above me.  Ryan stared in stunned silence.

Aurora pushed past the men.  "She heard Henry.  She didn't want to take his last parent from him.  She didn't want to kill you Tony.  She loves you, don't you get that by now."  She was angry at them.

"I know she loves me, why do think I'm here.  To get laid?"  Tony was angry.

Tristan walked in to the room, "You two fighting is making her want to fight again.  She's keen to anger, you two should know that."

Aurora looked abashed.  She looked at me and patted my shoulder and then left the room.   Everyone else left but Tony.   He knelt down beside my head and laid a gentle hand on my back.  "Maybe Henry is the key."  He sat above me in silence.  

"Family is the key."  It was like thunder booming in the room.  He lifted me by the shoulders so he could look me in the eyes.  He smiled, "Family is why you are going crazy.  I knew they were your friends, but they are the key.  We, your family, is why you fight the way you do."  He pulled me close and held me tight.  He picked me up to look me in the eyes, "We'll save them.  I promise, we'll fix this."  He dropped me abruptly and ran out of the room.

Alarms went off, everyone scrambled.  I heard the familiar chant of the birds.   Someone was using the place between worlds.  I could smell the familiar scent of burning flesh.  I crawled to the door and watched from the doorway as the lone figure burned in the darkness.  They knew we were here.  I stood up.  I took a step, and then another, and another until I was walking toward Thea.  "We must go."  She turned to me with fear.  She knew I was right, but she was afraid of the situation.  

I took Thea by the shoulders and spoke softly to her, "We will leave.  Seal the shadows we used to get here."

Thea smiled at me with relief, "We can't fight this fight, but we can heal, we can mend the wounded.  The long house is safe; we can make shadows to use."

"But then they can come in too."  Thea smiled at me.

"Not if it's only one person.  One person must be present or the traps will arm immediately.  You've taught us many things since we've been watching over you.  You may not have known it, but you are a great teacher even in your slumber."

Tony put his arm around me, "I know who would be good.  I don't want him fighting, but he's old enough, he's capable and he's strong enough to take more than a few people."

I nodded, "Henry would be good, and he'd be out of the way then."

Tony nodded, "My point exactly, responsibility with less danger."

I didn't agree there.  Thea helped me to the long house and I laid the initial ward for her to work off of. Tony fetched Henry.  When then men arrived Thea smiled at Henry.  

I spoke to the lad.  He had grown much since the last time I'd remember seeing him.  "I have a job for you.  It's a huge responsibility."  Henry's chest inflated, he was proud of himself.    "Thea has offered her clan's healing ability to our cause.  But they need the land here to heal well.  We need someone to bring people back and forth; it can only be one person.  Not me, Not Tony, Only you can do this."  He stepped forward proudly, but I stopped his progress, "Wait, I'm not finished.  I am trusting you to keep them safe.  If you get caught, you can't take the enemies here."  He started to protest, "I know you won't do it on purpose.  But if I can't save you to keep my people safe, I will kill you."  His eyes darkened and his smile faded.

Thea looked at me with anger.  "You are scaring the boy."

Tony smiled, "She's doing it on purpose."  Tony turned to his son, "Cari will kill you if you let her down.  But more importantly, she trusts you with her family.  She trusts no one with her family's safety, not even me.  It's yours if you want it."

Henry smiled, his pride returning, "Where do I sign?"

I said and pointed to the new area.  "Spit."

He looked at me.  Thea laughed.  "I need your DNA, spitting works well.  Spit over there."  She pointed where I had.

Henry did and there was a silent thunder boom.  Thea looked at me.  "We will make it shadows at any time of the day.  Give us a week before you use it before dark."  I nodded.

A crowd of men and women filed into the long building, Alex was at their lead.  He stopped well short of me.  He was afraid of me.  I looked at them in askance.

Alex started to speak but stumbled.  He cleared his throat that sounded nearly like a roar.  A woman in the back giggled but was quickly quieted.  He tried again, "If we join you, will you take care of us too."

Tony stepped forward, "Of course."  

But Alex glared at him, "We won't join just for you, we'll follow if she," he pointed at me, "promises to protect us too."

Tony spoke again, "You mean like family?"

David stepped forward, "Yeah, we've been feeding her religiously for twelve years."

I took a step towards the crowd of Therians.  I touched David's arm and held out my hand to Alex.  

Tony whispered to Thea, "What's she doing?"  

Thea whispered back, "Bonding with the animals." I could hear the smile in her voice, "She offering them comfort like you would do for a beloved pet."  She stammered, "Not that they are pets, it's just the gesture."

Alex looked at me.  I wiggled my fingers and he took my hand.  Every other Therian in the room touched the one in front of them and to their side, a network of comfort.  David looked up to Tony, "We are in."

# The Unimaginable

It didn't take long to get everyone together and bid farewell to the town hidden in the mountains.  Tony and I were the last to leave.  I helped Thea lay the last of the wards around the town to keep my family safe.  Once I stepped into reality, I knew Valence would come after me.  I wasn't afraid of him, but I was afraid for my family.  And even though I slumbered for the past twelve years, these people were my family.  And I would protect them.

Tony and I were the last to stand inside the circle.  Thea waited to close the barrier.  I looked up at the stars.  I would probably be the last time my life would be this calm for a long time.  Tony put his arm around me.  I wrapped my arms around his waist.  I looked at Thea and then she was gone, I was still in Tony's arms, but the natural scene we were in in had been replaced by concrete and dust.  I buried my face in Tony's chest.  I tried not to cry.

"You are mighty emotional lately."  Tony hugged me tight to him.  I couldn't explain it.  I didn't know why, but he held me anyway.

When I had gathered myself together, Tony unfurled me from his body and we walked down a long corridor.  Men and women smiled and greeted him.  Some saluted him.  He smiled at them.  I felt invisible.  It wasn't until a vampire was walking by that I realized they had all been human.  The vampire stopped ten feet in front of us blocking our way.  He stared at me under Tony's arm.  His jaw dropped.  I looked up at Tony and smiled down at me.  "I knew someone would know you were here soon enough."  The vampire in front of us turned and ran yelling, "Il Cane comes."

Tony laughed, "So much for a quiet entrance."  Tony let go of me but I clung to him.  He looked down at me and wrapped his arm back around me.  "The Hound does not snuggle."

I looked up at him.  He frowned.  "Okay.  We'll keep them away."  You could hear echoes coming from the way the vampire had run.  Tony opened a door.  "We are here anyway.  It was a closet, but we figured you wouldn't mind cramped as long as it was alone and shielded.  Aurora said Alec and Valentine worked a little extra shielding in so you could sleep in peace."  

I walked inside and I was cut off.  I stepped out of the doorway and I could feel everyone again.  Tony smiled, "its okay.  Ryan or I can be with you if you need something to hold onto, but this way until we can save them, you have a place to collect yourself."  I stepped back inside and I nearly tripped over a bundle on the floor.  I picked it up and unrolled it on the bed.  My sword lay shining in the dim light from the oil lamps outside the door.  Two well shined daggers lay in their sheathes beside it.  

I sat down on the bed staring at my weapons.  "Alex said he took care of the sword.  He couldn't take care of the daggers."  I nodded the daggers were sliver plated; to vampires and Therians silver was deadly.  I picked up the sword in its sheath and pulled the hilt from the casing and the ring of the metal was music to my ears.  I closed my eyes and leaned the cold steel against my forehead.  I missed the cold hard steel against my skin.  

A voice from the door chimed in, "She looks like she's going to make love to the sword."

Tony laughed, "She probably would if she could."

The girl giggled and smiled at him with bright flirty eyes.  I watched as she flirted with Tony.  He was being nice and flirting back.  She giggled again, and I went back to my weapons.  I picked up the dagger and pulled its sliver blade from the scarab that held it.  I ran the flat of the blade against my skin.  The smell of burning flesh scented the air.  The girl flirting with Tony yelped and ran to me and pulled the dagger from my hand.  I glared at her and snatched it back.  I growled.

Tony pulled the girl back by her shoulder, "She's okay.  I won't let her hurt herself.  She is just familiarizing herself with the tools of her trade."  She squeaked and then hugged Tony, the hug lingered before she ran out the door.

I ran the sharp blade along my skin.  The small rivulet of blood swelled from the cut.  It didn't heal immediately.  Tony took the blade away as he sat on the bed.

I stared at the blood welling up from the cut.  "Girlfriend?"

He coughed, "That obvious."  He paused and blushed, "She doesn't know who you are. She's human."

"You love her?"  

He put his arm around me, "No."  It was that simple.  My body relaxed into his but I watched the blood run down my arm.  "Are you hungry?" he asked me.

I shook my head.  "Nothing from the blood?" He asked. 

I shook my head again.  "The beast is not here.  Like the nightmares, nothing but you."  I looked up at Tony and he smiled.

Another voice came from the door way.  "Am I interrupting?"  I looked around Tony, to see a man standing there.  He was tall, his head nearly brushed to top of the door way.  "Tony.  Tristan wanted me to get you.  Aurora has something to show HER."  He nodded towards me.

Tony asked, "You okay, you want to do this now?"

I shook my head but got up anyway and started for the door.

"If she isn't ready why is she going?"  the man was confused.  

I walked past him with only three words on my lips, "Honor, Duty, and Obligation."

Tony laughed, "That's why."  We followed the man to Aurora, though I could find her easily, I could feel everything again.  I fought the beast inside me.  I pushed back the nightmares and held on to the man beside me.  

We took a left in the corridor, a right a left and we kept making turns. This place was a maze.  It reminded me of the catacombs in Dangdburgh but man made.  

I grabbed the man's arm, "Why didn't you just bring us from the right?"  He looked at me stunned.

"Wha?"

Tony laughed, "She asked you why you are taking us the long way?"

He stammered, "Be...because the straight path is booby trapped."  

"I looked at Tony, did you do that?"

He shook his head.  "You don't know where we are?"

It was my turn to shake my head.  

"Well I can feel your magic everywhere."

I blinked, "We're in the catacombs below Dangdburgh?"  Tony nodded.

I turned to the right and found the place that was booby trapped.  I nodded, I remembered the trap, the magic here to keep things safe.  I touched the barrier and it fell.  I walked through to the other side and then back to the man standing in awe.  "You can go that way now."  I turned to Tony, "Why didn't anyone take them down, and why are we in the one place they would look."

The man yelped.  Tony smiled, "They do look, but you have many barriers that we don't take down, and they keep us safe from those that would come.  As for not taking them down, no one knows how, or what you did.  Aurora can't see them.  I can feel them, but I can't touch them."  

I looked to the man as he cringed behind Tony.  "When we are done here, show me those that are in the middle of living areas.  I will make it safe.  And then I want you to show me the areas that you need the barriers I will fortify them."  He looked at me like I was an alien. 

"Well Josh, she won't bite you unless you ask."  Tony laughed.

Josh stammered, "Um.  Okay.  I. Guess."

I put my hand on Josh, he yelped.  I took my hand off.  "Will you show me the dangers?"  I asked softly and carefully.  I touched him again.  And he relaxed.

He nodded.  "Sure thing, after Aurora gets her hooks in you."  He said it as if he was more afraid for my life.

"Lead the way Josh."  I patted his back.

Josh led the way to Aurora and when I found her I felt my blood boil.  It wasn't anger; it really felt like my blood was boiling.  I frantically looked around and found what I did not think I would ever say again.  But there they were - horrors unimaginable.  

Aurora sounded panicked, "I didn't do it I swear.  I was just reading."

I asked "Out loud?"

Aurora hung her head.  I spoke words that I did not know what they meant.  The language was long since dead, but it was the power that ran the device that made the room heat vampire blood.

Aurora sank to the floor, she was tired.  She had been fighting the machine for longer than needed.  

Josh ran to her and helped her into a chair.

I tried not to raise my voice, but the fury in it I could not contain. "These were hidden for a reason."

I picked up the book that Aurora had been reading, and words sprang to life on the page.  I turned the book so Aurora could read it.  "Vampire Torture Machine by George Washington".  

Aurora looked up at me.  "How did you do that?"

I shrugged, "I just touched it."

Tony picked up a book but it didn't do anything.  He handed it to me.  I took the leather bound book in my hand and words shown like a mist on the page, "The Origins of Man by Charles Darwin".  I laid the book back down.  "This one you can read.  It is a history of vampires.  Darwin found many disturbing things in his research that he did not share with the world."

Tony picked it up.  And the words solidified so he could read them.  He looked up at me.  "How?"

"I am Keeper of Secrets."  

Aurora looked up at me, "But....",she stopped, "I never tried to read them while I was Keeper."

I nodded, "It is more than just protecting them.  It is being there so that the leaders can use what is needed.  It became what you had were out of necessity.  There are things that if used could not only destroy the user, but magic, or even the world.  There are weapons here that are beyond imagination."

Josh looked over at me.  "I guess you'll be sorting these things out then.  I'll go."

I grabbed his arm.  "This can wait, safety comes first."  I turned to Aurora.  "Do. Not. Touch. Anything. Else."

She nodded and I turned to see Tony smiling wider than he had in the days since he'd woken me.  "What?" I asked him.

"And you say you aren't a leader."  He wrapped his arm around me.  "Josh, lead the way my man.  Take Il Cane to her creations."  He grabbed his arm.  "Be clear on what needs to happen.  Strengthen or Destroy.  Understand me.  Cari is very literal."

He nodded with fear in his eyes.  And we followed him through the underground.

# Fortifications

Josh walked me around the compound, from the inside out.  We started with the trap I had first disarmed, he tentatively walked through it.  When he didn't die he literally skipped to the next one.  

I asked, "Who built up the walls?"

Josh looked at me confused.  Tony laughed, "We built what we could to reinforce the ground from above and to make the humans more comfortable as they moved underground."

I was not surprised it was for the humans, "Concrete and steel are more comfortable than stone?"  I shook my head.  I ran my hand along the wall.  "I guess it's not as cold and damp."  Tony put his arm around me as we walked to the next trap behind Josh.

Josh stopped in his tracks.  "This one impedes our food supply, you can destroy it."  

I smiled and touched the barrier.  The hum and fizz of the power returned to where it came from.  Josh looked at me with concern. "Where does that go?"

"The power?"  I asked, to make sure I answered him correctly.

"That sound was power? Where does it go?"  Josh was curious.  

"It goes back to the elements it was created from."

"So you are gaining more power?"  He looked concerned.

"Not really.  But I guess some of it is coming back to me.  That trap was made of electricity, a variant of fire."  It was hard to explain to someone without any magical power.  

He nodded and walked towards the next one.  

By the third one I disarmed Josh was getting more talkative.  "My wife says that vampires are monsters who only want to eat us."

Tony laughed, I did not.  "What do you think?"

Josh shrugged, "I don't know.   We see what they are doing above ground, but there others here who seem to never feed."

Tony smiled, "We feed, but only on the willing.  You can thank Cari for that way of life.  It stems from her need to not hunt."

Josh looked at me.  "I have a friend, he's a vampire now.  He says that you are something to be feared.  But you are just a woman, and no offense, just a small one."

Tony laughed so hard he had to stop walking.  Josh looked at him funny, "Why is he laughing?"

"I am to be feared.  Vampires are one of the many things that go bump in the night.  I'm the one who bumps back."

Tony composed himself to explain, "She is Il Cane, The Hound or Death to others.  She was the controlling force The Council used to keep their kingdoms in line.  She was meant to be scary."

"I don't believe she could do that.  You are so afraid, so lost in your own head to be much help in this war."  Josh stated matter of factly.

Tony watched my reaction.  He was stunned that I did nothing and said nothing.  I asked him, "What?"

"You didn't say anything, you didn't get angry, nothing." He paused, "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine.  He's entitled to his opinion.  And he's probably right."  I knew I wasn't up to par.

Tony shook his head.  "When it comes down to it, you will do what needs doing.  You can't do anything else.  It's the way you are wired."

Josh interrupted, "Here is another.  You can destroy this one."

I did and there was a loud pop.  Josh asked, "What was that?"

"That was air returning to the void that was there."  Tony looked at me, "You can't manipulate air."

I smiled at him. "I can't but someone else can.  I didn't say I put them all up.  All the traps are based on wards, I can remove the ward and the other magic dissipates with it."

Tony nodded, "So who did that?"

"I can only surmise, but Ant possibly.  He's the only other vampire who's been in Dangdburgh who can manipulate death magic and the elements.  But it could be the work of two or more vampires."

Tony asked, "Can I try the next one?  Tell me what to do?"

I shrugged I didn't care if he did the rest or not.  He was a smart man he could do just about anything he wanted too.

Josh looked at us, "How sweet, she thinks you are the best thing since sliced bread."

Tony smiled, "I am."

I laughed, "He was born before they started selling sliced bread."

Josh rolled his eyes.

I walked under Tony's arm; I didn't want to be far from him.  I needed his support, but I could feel the hunger pressing on me.

When we stopped again Tony held out his hand feeling for the ward.  He found it.  "Now what?"

"Remove the ward."

"How?" He asked.

"Just will it gone.  Close it however you'd close one you made."  It was obvious to me.

Tony frowned, "I can't sustain a ward for long."

I stood behind Tony and put my arms around his waist, right hand holding my left wrist.  I put my cheek against his back.  "Close your eyes.  Find the base with your power.  Find the latch, the place where the spell started.  And push it apart."

A bright light flashed in the room and Josh yelped.  

"I can't do another.  I have to feed now.  That took a lot of effort."  I nodded and hugged Tony.

Josh looked at us.  "She looks ravenous."  

Tony turned around and picked up my chin so he could look at me.  "She does, doesn't she?  Come one, we'll continue later."  

Josh smiled, "We can strengthen the rest when you are strong enough.  That's all that's left."    

I nodded and Josh was gone.  He left quickly.  Rather we left quickly.  Tony had whisked us away.  I looked up at him, "We could have walked."

He shook his head.  "No, we couldn't wait.  Your eyes have gone red.  They never do that Cari.  You are losing control."

"I don't feel like I am.  I'm just hungry."  I fell to my knees.

Tony scooped me up, "You are more than hungry."

Ryan was there almost in an instant as was Mia.  They each offered me their wrists.  I looked at Mia, she never offered from the vein.  Ryan withdrew his wrist and Mia put her wrist in my mouth, not letting me take no for an answer.  I bit softly into her wrist.  She shuttered.  I stopped.

She looked at me with questioning eyes and asked in her slow soft voice, "What's wrong?"

"You shuttered."  I said flattly.  "I don't want to hurt you."

Mia put her hand on my head and gently guided me back to her bleeding wrist.  "It's okay.  You won't hurt me."

Tony whispered in my ear, "Mia likes to be bitten.  But she only trusts a few of us to do it."

I rested my head against Tony's arm and drank from my longtime friend for the first time.  Her eyes fluttered in enjoyment.  The succubus in me pushed more sex down the line.  Mia's eyes shot wide open, but she relaxed in the sensation as I fed.  I stopped as Mia collapsed from the orgasm she had reached while standing.

She got up quickly, "I'm okay."  She smiled at me giddily, "I'm great."  She looked at me with new eyes.  She asked tentatively, "Is it always like that?"

"It can be."

Ryan laughed, "She didn't think you would be interested in what she enjoyed.  I told her you'd please her if it's what she wanted."

I patted Mia's hand.  "If it's what you want."  She nodded enthusiastically.  Nearly eight hundred years after we'd first met, Mia had taken an interest in sex.

I looked up at Tony, "Feed, Ryan can take care of me while you are gone."

Tony set me down on a cot.  "She needs more."  He looked to Ryan and Ryan smiled with a nod.  

"You the boss."  He laughed.

Mia sat down on the cot next to me and whispered in my ear.  "He's sexy."  She blushed and I nodded.  "He won't feed on me."

I turned to her, "You don't want him, if you want more than what we just did talk with Damian."  She blushed more.  "You don't want to ask?"

Mia shook her head.  "I'll ask him for you.  In two days when you can feed someone again, go to him."  

She smiled at me and then kissed my cheek.  "I love you, I missed you."

I hugged Mia.  "I missed you too."  I paused carefully before telling her I loved her too.

Mia left to go find something else to do.  Ryan sat down next to me with questioning eyes.  "She wanted to be with Tony."

"What did you tell her?"  He really wanted to gauge my reaction to someone wanting the man who I had loved for nearly eight hundred years.

"She didn't want him.  I didn't tell her why though, but I told her to be with Damian."  Ryan looked at me with a question in his eyes.  I smiled.  "I didn't tell her he wouldn't use his power like that."

Ryan nodded, "You don't think he would for her?"

I shook my head.  "He wants it to be real.  He can persuade a woman to his bed without the bite.  He won't use it to make them feel more than what he can offer in bed."

"In other words he doesn't want to set the bar too high."

I nodded.

Ryan offered me his arm, "No sex for me."  

I laughed and then bit his arm.  Ryan's eyes fluttered for a moment before the feeling passed and he let me feed in silence.  When I withdrew Ryan looked at me, "Why is it always so much on the initiation?  I've always wanted to ask."

Damian answered behind him, "Because it's the venom of our bites, it's meant to be intoxicating so we can drink your blood.  Cari pulls back on it, but she can't until she's started the blood flow. He looked at me, you beckoned."

I nodded, "I have a favor to ask you."

He smiled, "You can't feed on me too."

I laughed, "Mia wants a vampire with your talents."

He sat down on the other side of me, "I heard she was getting a taste for the candy."

Ryan reached around me and smacked Damian in the head, "That's my sister you are talking about."

Damian smiled, "And what would you have me do?"

"Whatever she wants of you."

Ryan laughed, "Cari gave her a taste, Mia's big O made her fall down."

I smacked Ryan's leg, "I don't think she wants just that.  And I don't think she's interested in women or I would oblige her."

Damian smiled, "I always forget you could care less about the gender of your sexual partners.  It always amazed me when one of the girls wound up in your room naked."

Ryan's mouth fell open.  Damian laughed, "For you my pet anything."  I thanked Damian with a kiss on his hand.

Damian left me alone on the cot with Ryan.  Ryan started at me. "Now I can't get the thought of you and a hottie in bed together."  

I smacked his leg then kissed him softly.  "I prefer men."  I got up started walking.  I walked what felt like forever.  I was trying to find my room.  I was trying to get my barrings.  I found myself in the armory.

I had an idea.  I left the armory and went to find Josh.  

I found him in the cafeteria with a pretty young girl.  "Josh, when you are done, I can finish what we started.  I have an idea; I need to get some things together.  Find me in the armory when you are ready."

He finished his mouthful, "Okay.  Cari, this is my wife, Sarah.  She wanted to meet the famed Il Cane, and here you are."

I held out my hand and Sarah looked at it with fear.  "I smiled, I don't bit unless you tell me I can.  I can offer you my hand without you worrying about such things."  I took my hand back and held it out again, with my palm upward facing, "This means I'd like to feed."  I turned my palm to the side, "This is how do you do."

She looked up at me with a smile.  "No one ever explained it to me before.  They just said never give a vampire your hand."

"Well I wouldn't give my hand to a vampire outside this compound."   I looked at Josh, "When you are done."

Sarah stood up and hugged me, "Thank you for helping us."  I stood there a bit stunned and patted her back awkwardly.

I left to find the laundry area.  I needed some large sheets or something.  It wasn't hard; there were only so many places in the catacombs to find water.  I found a few large sheets.  I didn't know how many I would need.  I then headed to the armory.

About twenty minutes later Josh joined me with a smile. "My wife likes you."  I smiled back.  "So what do you need?"  

"I got it all; just take me to the barriers."

Josh looked around, "Where's Tony?"

I shrugged.  He smiled, "I thought you two were joined at the hip."

"He's probably with his human girlfriend."  There was no jealousy in my voice, why should I care who he slept with now.  Josh looked at me like I was an alien again.  He shook his head but left it alone.  He led me to the first barrier.  "This one we've had firefights through.  No one is there right now because we just took them all out, and reinforcements haven't arrived.

I took a spike out of the bag of things I'd grabbed from the armory and threw it at the top of corner of the archway where the ward started.  Then I threw one on its opposite wall.  On the spike were strings that I used to wench up the sheets.  I pulled them tight and now a sheet hung between us and the barrier.  I stood between the barrier and the sheet and I blurred the sheets reality to look like a cave in.  Shadows were easy to manipulate into whatever you needed the viewer to see.  

I turned and touched the barrier and gave it more strength.  I made the ward stronger, it pulsed with energy.  No one would get through.

Josh lead me to the remaining two barriers and I gave them the same treatment.   Josh had never asked me what I was doing.  I guess he trusted me.

When we were done, I asked, "Josh, can you take me back to my room.  I can't seem to find it."  

He smiled and nodded.

# Not Regulation

Josh took me to the hole in the wall closet that I was to call my own.  My weapons still lay on the bed untouched.  I started at them, wondering why for the second time I had not put them on.  I strapped one dagger to my wrist in its sheath, and the dagger on the opposite side.  I pulled my sleeves over the daggers and I felt better already.  I started at the sword on the bed.  I picked it up and strapped the belt to my waist.  I felt more whole.  I felt more like myself than I had all day.

Inside my closet I was alone.  There were no links to anyone.  It was quiet in my mind.  It was frightening.  I found myself curled in the corner of the room shivering.  I wondered if I died in here if anyone would even know something was wrong.

I closed my eyes.  Daylight must be upon us.  In the darkness of the catacombs it was hard to tell.  But I felt weak; I closed my eyes and drifted into to sleep.  I thought it would be peaceful with no external influences but it wasn't.  I had my own nightmares, things that were not from outside.  I watched as I tore a village apart.  I tore men's head from their bodies.  I ripped out throats.  It wasn't like other times where I felt the blood on my hands, their flesh tearing under my fingers.  I watched from a distance.  I watched from someone else's eyes.

My eyes shot open, someone watched me kill that village and didn't try to stop me.  When I looked up in the dim light I saw a man standing above me.  I tried to back away, but I was already in a corner.  He smiled at me.  "You don't remember me do you?"

I blinked.  I shook my head.  I couldn't place him.  I knew I should know him.  

He sneered at me.  "I watched you murder families.  I hated you for it.  I hated you for taking my place.  I wanted to use it against you.  But your Knight in Shining armor came to save you and he and his father whisked you away before I could run and tell our father."

I thought harder, I had no kin.   The man lit a torch and I recognized the man's features in the flickering light.  "Christopher Salmeri, Sal's protégée."  

I stood up.  I couldn't get away from him.  He looked like he wanted to hurt me.  I needed to be on my feet.  He spat at my feet.

I pulled my sword from its sheath.  He stepped back in shock.  "I wasn't spitting on you.  You mentioned Sal.  I hate him more than I hate you."

It was my turn to be shocked.  

"He betrayed us all.  He said we could live in peace with the humans for all of our existence.  Then he sides with the men who would turn the humans into cattle for slaughter.  He needs to die.  I only came to see our so called savior."  Christopher sneered at the thought.  "I thought you would be bigger.  You were easy to manipulate in your dreams.  You are still weak.  Fear consumes you."  

I felt his power wash over me.  He tried to make me afraid again.  I closed my eyes and pulled his power into me.  It tasted like bitter fruit.  It washed over me like a flood.  He tried to let pull back but I wouldn't let him.  I opened my eyes and saw fear in his eyes.  I pulled on his power and he fell to his knees.  

The door burst open and Tony threw the man out of my room and pinned me to the wall.  "Let him go."

I looked into Tony's eyes.  He spoke softly, "He's on our side.  Let him go."

I did as he asked and I heard the man cry out in relief.  "He started it."  It sounded childish as soon as I said it.

He hugged me tightly.  "I couldn't feel what was wrong, but our power alarms went off.  Someone was using their powers stronger than regulations allowed.  One of the necromancers pointed in the direction of your room.  I came as fast as I could."

Christopher stood in the doorway.  "You don't care if I'm alright.  You're as much of an ass as she is."

Tony turned on him with fury in his eyes.  "You used fear on Il Cane, what did you expect."   He stalked towards the man and Christopher took a step back, "She could have eaten you for supper if I hadn't stopped her.  You want me to care when you put yourself in danger."  Christopher's back was against the wall, he shook in fear.  "You took advantage of her disconnection.  I have no sympathy for you.  Get out of my sight."  Christopher turned and tried not to run away.  He only mildly succeeded.

The hallway was full of people with weapons drawn, Tony stood in the middle in a rage I had never seen him in.  Tristan put his hand on Tony's shoulder and Tony turned his fury on his friend.  It quickly faded and Tristan smiled back at his friend.  "Everything's okay.  It's good to know the sensor's work."  Tristan peaked in the door and saw me cowering in the corner again.  He smiled at me but turned back to Tony, "You have work to do in there; I don't think she likes the room."

A figure slipped behind the men and shut the door behind her.  I looked up to see the small slip of a girl staring down at me with concern.  It was the girl who was flirting with Tony earlier.  She knelt in front of me.  My sword was leaning against my forehead.  She pushed it aside, catching her little finger on the edge.  She stuck the cut in her mouth and sucked on it.  And smiled at me, she offered me the cut.  "Are you hungry?"

I stared at her; I didn't know what to think.  She moved her hand closer and when I didn't react she let the blood drip on to my lips, "It's okay, I know you won't hurt me."

I licked my lips, the taste of blood made my eyes roll back.  She put her finger in my mouth and I let the blood flow down my throat until the wound was closed.  I opened my mouth and she pulled her finger out and smiled.  "You love Tony don't you?"  She smiled.  "It's okay.  I knew you'd come and I knew I'd let you take him back."  She hugged me, "Take care of him."  A tear slid down her cheek.  I wiped it away.  She beamed at me.  "I know you will."  She stood up and turned to see Tony standing behind her.  She gave him a hug then kissed him goodbye.

He stood there in silence.  

We sat in silence for what seemed like forever.  He watched me shiver in the corner.  He didn't know what to make of me, and I didn't know what to think of myself.  I was a mess and that thought made me cry.  He grabbed my hands and pulled me to my feet and then scooped me up in his arms.  He left the room.  He didn't say where he was going he just carried me like a child.  It would have made me angry if it were anyone other than him.

# Solo Maneuvers

Tony carried me through the corridors.  People stopped and stared a moment before turning to go back about their business.  He opened a door to a dark room and tossed me.  I yelped, but I landed on the bed.  I laughed, it was actually rather fun.

Tony smiled and shut the door behind him and pulled off his shirt.  "You can stay with me tonight."  

I raised an eye brow at him, he smiled and lay down next to me and draped his arm over my legs and looked up at me sleepily.  I laid down and snuggled up against Tony.  He put his head down on his arm and looked at me.  I looked up at him and kissed his lips tenderly before rolling over on my side.  He tucked me into him and we slept.

When I woke Tony was sitting on the edge of the bed pulling clothes on.  "You use to be up before me."  He leaned over and offered me his wrist.  "Eat.  You need something again.  You are using up too much power on something."

I bit his wrist and pulled in his scent, his power.  It washed over me with uncertainty.  I felt better with every swallow.  Tony pulled his arm away before I had finished.  He looked at me carefully; he turned my head from side to side.  "What?"

"You aren't drinking very much blood but you're siphoning off my energy.  You sure you are okay?"  Tony looked very concerned.

"I feel fine."  

"You don't look fine.  You look weak.  We have to get them back, I think they are draining you, you are keeping them alive, by sucking you dry."  Tony frowned.  "Stay here I'll go get someone else to feed you."

I lay back in bed and closed my eyes.  I saw the caged beast in my mind, and the glass window separating me from my family.  It felt like they stared at me with pleading eyes.  Pleading, "Come Save Me."

I stared at them in my mind, not sure I could help them.  I didn't know where they were.  The Coalition thought they were dead, they didn't know where they were.  I sat up straight.  I knew who would know.  We were under Dangdburgh.  He wouldn't be far from home.  He liked his club too much, the fool.

I got up and slipped out the door and found the time.  I couldn't stride into town in the sunlight.  It was well past midnight.  I thought about Johnny Rose, and then I stepped into the shadows outside his club.  The sign still blinked Frozen.  The mere arrogance, but no one stood outside waiting.  

I opened the door, and an alarm sounded.  I walked in to men pointing guns at me.  I smiled and pulled out my sword and a dagger in my left hand.  Someone laughed, another commented, "A sword to a gun fight."  

The bullets began firing and I walked through them like butter.  I felt every bullet hit.  I shrugged them off.  I decapitated the first man I reached and gutted the second.  The humans stared at me.  The vampires in the room ran.  I smiled.  

Behind the bar stood Zach, Johnny's Lesser Chevalier.  He hadn't aged a day.  I smiled at him and he tried to run.  I grabbed the back of his shirt and dragged him over the table.  The men began shooting again.  Zach yelled for them to stop.   They didn't.  I took several more bullets in the back.  I raced up the stairs and found Johnny's office.  He and Breeana were sitting peacefully in conversation.  I threw Zach against the wall in front of me and he collapsed to the ground.  I put my sword against Breeana's throat and my dagger at her nose.  "Where are they?"

She stared at me unable to speak.  She licked her lips trying to make herself talk.  "I don't..." I didn't let her finish I cut off her head in one clean moment.  And her body burned at my thought.  I let the fire get out of control.  It caught the couch on fire and started to burn across to the curtains.  Johnny stood against the wall in fear.  "Where are they?"

"I don't know Cari.  I really don't know who you are talking about."  He was lying I could tell.  I reached around his head and I twisted breaking his neck.  I took the two lifeless bodies and I carried them through the shadows to the only place I knew would cut them off from everything they knew and loved - my closet in the wall.

# Oblivion

I dropped the men on the floor and they landed with a thud.  I kicked over the bed and started tying them to the spring frame below the bed.  Someone knocked on the door, I ignored it.  I heard a familiar voice on the other side but I couldn't recognize whose it was.  "Car, you okay in there?"  The door knob started to turn.  I grabbed it to hold it shut.  

The person banged on the door.  "Cari you okay?"  he called down the hall, "Get someone here quickly."

In a moment there was people outside the door, but the easiest way in was not threw the door and Tony was standing in front of me in the shadows.  He stared at me before he looked down and saw what I'd brought to play with.  He looked up at me.  There was fury in his eyes, but it faded quickly into hatred for the man below him.  He fought the urge to kick him while he slept.  He walked over to me carefully; he didn't want to give in to his primal beast.  He hated Johnny more in that moment that I'd seen Tony hated anyone ever.  

He stood in front of me as superior, not as friend or lover, he stood there as my boss.  "Let it go."  I dropped let go of the handle, he pushed me out of the way and he opened the door.  "Get a lock up room."  There was a murmur though the hall.  Tristan stood in the doorway; he had been the one banging on the door.  Tony flung the door open to reveal the presents I had brought them.  "She's been busy while she's been gone."  He didn't look back at me as he left the room.  Tristan stared at me, for that matter everyone stared at me.

I heard someone say, "How's she standing with that many bullets?"  

I looked down and my clothes were torn to pieces.  They were hanging by threads; it was a feat that they hung there at all.  

I walked out of the room through the crowd of people.  I was at peace with myself.  I knew everyone was angry at me.  But I was at peace with myself.

I walked in circles around the compound.  I didn't have any place to go.  Every so often I'd hear a clink on the ground as a bullet fell from my body.  I was healing slowly, but I was healing.  I just walked.  No one stopped me; no one asked me what I was doing.  I just walked.

I walked for hours.  Just around in a circle around the compound.  About the third pass people started to mutter as I passed them.  They were concerned.  I found myself walking past an open room, I heard yelling coming from the room.  Tristan was yelling at Tony.  I stopped and listened. 

"It was your job to keep her at bay.  She could have brought them down on us.  She didn't think.  Does she ever think?"  Tony was getting in trouble for my actions.  I stepped into the room.  Tristan turned his fury on me.  "And she doesn't even mind her own business."

Tony looked at me like I was the enemy.  I ignored his abuse and I turned to Tristan with a cold voice, "I need no baby sitter.  You want to yell at someone, Yell at me.  He had nothing to do with my actions.  He is not my guardian."  

Tristan took a step back.  He was afraid of me.  I took advantage of it, "They wouldn't have tracked their own people.  Not one who was loyal to Sal.  He's their right hand isn't he?"

"You don't know that for sure."  

I looked at him with a glare of hatred how could someone be so stupid? "I've known Valence his entire vampire life.  Loyalty is life.  Loyalty to his own measly skin but he expect everyone to be like him.   He would have fought any tracking of the people.  He has the perfect tracker in Sal.  He can track all my kin, just as Sal can track all Valence's kin.   I brought him to the one place no one could find him.  He was cut off from the world.  You brought him out."

Tristan looked almost abashed, but the fury was in his eyes.  He didn't know what to say.  

"So yell at me.  Tell me I'm unfit to be in your service and I'll go.  I'll leave you to your battle.  But I will take my presents with me.  All of them, even the ones you gained while I was asleep."

Tony grabbed my arm, he was pleading with me.  I shook of his hand.  He grabbed me and turned me to him.  "You can't.  You can't leave us again."

I sank to my knees, he still hated me for leaving.  I didn't cry.  I didn't move, I just lay in a ball at his feet.  They stared at me.

Tristan walked over and kicked me in the side.  "Get up"

I did not.  He kicked me again.  I still didn't move.  He kicked again and I caught his leg and pulled it from underneath him.  He fell smacking his head against the floor.  I crawled over his body and got in his face.  "Kick me again and see how long you live."  Tony pulled me off of Tristan and threw me against the wall.  

"You okay?"  Tristan sat up and rubbed his head.  

"Yeah.  I should have known better.  After the second one I felt her anger rise, but I didn't care."

I lay crumpled on the floor where Tony left me.  I sank into slumber.  I couldn't stay away anymore.  I slept the dreamless sleep of the undead.

When I woke I was in Tony's bed.  He wasn't anywhere to be found.  There were torches in every corner burning bright; they weren't going to let me do that again.  I lay back in the bed.  I felt Johnny's laughter in my mind.  I tried to block him out.  But it was over powering.  I focused on the window in my mind.  Their pain was better than Johnny's maniacal laughter in my head.

Hours past and no one came.  My head hurt from the hunger.  I let my family drain me of my energy.  There was nothing more I could do for them.

The door opened and all I heard was "Shit!"

I didn't open my eyes.  I didn't care.  I let myself slip into oblivion.

# The Basics Of Getting Information

The next time I woke up I was laying in what smelled like an infirmary with an IV in my arm.  I tried to open my eyes, but all I saw was a blurry room.  I tried to blink away the clouds, nothing helped.  I heard someone speak softly, "She's awake, what do I do?"

I felt a hand on my head and a light shine in my eyes.  "She's waking up, that's good.  She's perking up with that IV in her arm."

I blinked again and I was able to see strangers standing over me.  The woman standing above me smiled, "Cari, it's okay.  I'm Dr. Flanagan, you can call me Eve."

I blinked again and I was able to focus.  She smiled again, "You've been sedated for a week.  We needed you to regain your strength."  She grabbed my hand, and pulled me to sit up.  "You wanted to sit right."  I nodded.  "I'm a weak empath."  That explained it.

I looked around; I was the only one in the room.  Eve called over her shoulder, "Tell Tristan and Tony she's awake."

I shook my head.  Eve smiled, "It's okay, they are upset, but they've been bugging us all week to see you.  Tony was very worried."

I fell back in the bed.  Eve pulled me forward again.  "Sit up, you need to sit.  You have to stretch your muscles."

I sighed.  "Why didn't they just let me die?"  It was a rhetorical question.  

Eve patted my back, "I'll let them explain everything to you." And as if on cue Tony and Tristan's large frames graced my poor vision, I fell back in the bed.  

Eve sighed, "Get her to sit up for a while."

Tony nodded and I rolled over away from them.  

"I guess we deserve that."  Tristan was in a good mood.

"Cari, we need to talk."

I shrugged.  "Johnny won't give up any information."

I didn't look over my shoulder, "He won't if you treat him like a human."

Tony walked around and pulled up a chair and sat in front of me.  "I told you she'd say you were doing it wrong."

Tristan asked me, "What am I having them do wrong?"

"You are torturing him.  You are trying to make him talk."  I rolled over so I could look at his reaction.  "You have to torture Zach.  Kill Zach if it comes down to it.  I didn't bring him here for the hell of it."

Tristan nodded, "He said you'd say something like that. We've tortured Zack too, no luck."

"You're just doing it wrong."  I rolled over, I'd rather look at Tony, but I closed my eyes.  I didn't want to see him smiling back at me.

"Doc said to make her sit, I have a better idea."  Tony pushed me out of bed.  

Tristan jumped out of the way.  My anger rose and I stood up and turned to see Tony laughing at me.  "That was quite the stunt, did you see that Trist."  I glared at him but the anger left me.  

"Come on.  I've a present for you."  Tristan looked at Tony with questioning eyes.  "Trist you may want to go the other way.  You won't like the present."

"Uh uh,"  He shook his head, "No way I'm letting her out of my sight with what I think you mean."

Tony led me down the hall into unmodified areas of the caves below Dangdburgh.  As we walked the maniacal laughter in my head grew stronger.  Tony opened a door that was guarded by two really big vampires, inside Johnny hung by iron chains.

I looked at Tony.  "Tristan said if he couldn't get anything out of him by the time you woke up and were strong enough, he'd let you take a crack at him.  I told him it would be dangerous."

I looked at Tristan he nodded, "Give it a go.  I trust you."

That was new, I knew he was lying it was clearly written all over his face.  "You lie."  

He nodded, "Yeah I do, but he trusts you."  He nodded to Tony.  "I'll take that."

I nodded.  "Bring Zack in here.  And silver chains."

Tristan left the room long enough to relay the message.  I looked at Johnny for the first time.  He looked back at me with longing eyes.  He thought I would spare him.  I licked my lips and his expression changed to pure fear.  He saw no hope now.  I smiled at him and he screamed, "Keep her away from me."  He tried to back into the wall but he couldn't move and I smiled even wider.  

The door opened and I looked as the two gnarly vampires dragged Zack in by the arms, and a scrawny human tossed in some silver chains.  I grabbed the chains and the silver burnt my hands.  I hung the chain on the peg next to Johnny.  I unclasped on hand and wrapped it in the silver manacle.  His skin burnt and he screamed in pain.  I did the other and tossed the other chain to the other side of the room on the floor.  Tony hung Zack on the opposite wall.

I turned to Johnny, "I will ask you one time and only one time before I get the answer the hard way.  Your life will end here and now without any more pain, it will be quick like Breeana's.  Where are they?"

He spat at me.  I smiled. " Have it your way."

I turned to Zach.  "I'll ask you the same thing, the same conditions."  He spat, but it lacked conviction.  An evil grin spread across my face as I took my silver dagger from my sleeve and I sliced his shirt from his body.  He had raw scars on his body.  He'd been recently tortured.  I cocked my head then ran a line down across his stomach, it wasn't very deep but the wound did not heal immediately with the silver against his skin.

I looked at Johnny and smiled, "Shall I make him a unic."  Johnny stared at me.  I smiled back, I turned around to Zach and unbutton his pants, then pulled them to his ankles.  I licked my lips.  Zach tried to protect himself.  I took his family jewels in my hand and rolled them in my hands.  I looked up at Zach as he hung.  He couldn't help but accept the tender touch.  I sliced down the middle and he screamed in pain.  I smiled up at him.  I sliced a cross along his stomach.  I licked the line of blood welling up from the new cut and stared in his eyes.  

Tristan muttered, "My god, she likes this."

Tony touched Tristan's arm, "It's not too late to leave."

Tristan shook his head, "If you are staying so am I.  I don't know how you can watch your girlfriend do this."

He looked over at Tristan, "I've seen her do worse things."

Fear showed on Tristan's face.

I took a look at Johnny his eyes were closed, "We can't have that."  I pulled at his eye lids and I cut them off.  He screamed in pain.  I slit his stomach and pulled out his intestines.  "Heal that."

I turned my attentions back to Zach.  "Where are they?"

I cut off Zach's fingers one at a time and made Johnny eat them.  I was about to cut off the part of Zach that made him a man when he spoke clearly.  "They are at the old refinery."  I stopped in mid slice and slight pulled out my sword and took of Zach's head.  As promised, it was a clean death.

Johnny cried out, "He told you."

I turned back to Johnny, "I told you your death would be quick if you told me.  His death was quick as I promised you on the other hand I'm going to bleed."

Tristan took my shoulder and pulled me back. "No."

I looked back at the man keeping me from my new toy.  He calmly said it again, "No."

Tony took my sword from my hand and ended Johnny's life.  His head rolled on the floor and I was disappointed.  Tristan looked at Tony, Tony shrugged, "She would kill to bleed him.  He had to die.  He may have been useful, but she hasn't hunted in a very long time.  We couldn't leave him here for her to play with.  She'd kill whoever got in her way."  

Tristan looked at me with fear in his eyes.  I only looked back at him out of the bloody haze.  Tony leaned in behind Tristan, "You need to leave now."

Tristan turned around and looked at him, Tony smiled, "Unless you want to see what's next."

"And what's next?"  He really didn't know.

Tony didn't smile.  "Sex.  Trading one lust for another."

Tristan looked back at me,"But she's calm."

Tony nodded, "Because you are here, you said No.  She wouldn't have listened if you hadn't been exuding calm all over her.  You have no idea what you do, but you tame the wild beast.  But if I don't make it change, she'll hunt and she'll kill.  She needs to sedate her lust."

Tristan reigned in  his power and I felt more like myself.  I glared at him and I reached for him.  He'd told me no.  Tony threw Johnny's head at me, "I killed him."

I turned my gaze on him and Tristan left the room.

Tony had my sword and he tossed it back and forth from hand to hand.  I threw the daggers on the ground.  He followed suit and then lunged at me.  He threw me against the wall.  My breath was crushed from my lungs.  He threw me to the other side of the room.  I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move, as he threw me from wall to wall.    He kissed me and everything melted away until I bit his tongue and drew blood.  He slapped me and I looked back at him with a bloodlust.  I threw myself at him and he grabbed me as we fell into the wall together.  

Tristan pulled the door shut when someone tried to come in and stop us.  I looked at the door and a way out I tried to go for it but Tony was there and he barred my way.  We grappled until he could pull me close enough to kiss me again.  I tried to push him away.  He kissed me again.  I gave a little.  In the back of my mind I fought for control.  Fought to put the beast back in its cage.  I wanted Tony.  I wanted him badly.  He could have uses his powers to calm me, but he didn't.  He beat me until I was nothing but a bloody pulp in his hands.  He kissed me again and I returned the kiss, he fed me his power through that kiss.  He gave me the strength so we could have sex for the first time in over eight hundred years.

# Unexpected Affairs

Tony sat against the way and I lay on the floor with my head in his lap.  Tony was trying to think of a way of getting out of the torture room without attracting too much attention.  I didn't care.

The door creaked open and Tristan slipped in.  He smiled and frowned all in the same instance.  "Eve's looking for her."  

Tony stood up naked, "Our clothes didn't quite make it through the process."  He grinned at Tristan as he reached down to help me stand.  "Can you stand?"

I nodded and he pulled me up to my feet.  Tristan stared I didn't know if it was surprise at seeing us standing there unashamed or if he was surprised by all the blood.  I reassured him, "It's not ours."   He looked at my face and he smiled.  

The looked around, "It is quite a mess."  He jumped back when the room caught fire.  

I grabbed my sword and my daggers and walked out the door.  "It's going to get hot."  Tristan looked at me and then back at the room and hurried out the room followed by Tony.  

Tony smiled, "Eve's going to get mad at us."  He grabbed the blanket someone offered him.  I walked past the offering.  Someone screamed and I hid the weapons in shadow and gave people the idea that they saw what they expected to see.  

Tristan blinked, "Why did she fade in and out."  

Tony laughed as the two men followed me, "She's give you want you expect to see."  He cocked his head to the side and checked out my rear, "And apparently you expect to see that."

When I turned around Tristan was red from head to toe.  I smiled sweetly and seductively at him and he got brighter red.  I turned around and went to the infirmary where Eve waited impatiently.

"Trist, it's okay, you can check her out.  She doesn't mind."  Tony tried to reassure him.

"She's your girl.  I shouldn't look at her like that."  He meant what he said.  Humans.

Tony put his arm around his friend, "I don't mind either."

They couldn't finish their conversation Eve screamed, "By the Gods."  Tony and Tristan ran into the room.  She looked at Tony and then back at me, "What the hell?"

"We got the information we needed.  And we had to put the beast back in place."  Tony stated as if it was common.

Tristan shook his head, "It's a long story"

Eve looked me over carefully, "She needs back on the IV and to sleep."

Eve wrapped me in a hospital gown and attached me to the IV drip again.  I could feel her need, her complete desire for the naked men in the room.  She helped me lay down in the bed.  I pulled her stethoscope and pulled her neck close to me, and I bit her.  Her eyes rolled back in her head and her knees got weak as her body spasmed in pleasure.  She pulled away and looked at me with a smile, "You read that?"

I nodded.  Tristan looked at her, "What just happened?"

Eve smiled, "She saw that I was a little hot and bothered by the nakedness.  She gave me what I needed to focus."

Tony smiled and whispered in my ear.  "Tristan needs a little bit too."

I looked up at him and he smiled at me.   Tony stood back up and said as he left, "I'm gonna go clean up."

Tristan started to leave but I caught his arm.  I looked at Eve and she caught my drift.  She pulled the curtains closed.

Tristan didn't try to pull away but he didn't turn around or come closer either.  I crawled out of bed and stood behind him and wrapped my arms around him.  I pressed my cheek against his back. I could feel his heart racing.  I whispered behind him.  "Turn around."

He shook his head.  I grabbed his shirt and pulled it over his head.  I ran my fingers down his sides and kissed his back.  He shivered.  I ran my tongue along his spine.  He lost a breath.  I turned him around and he didn't look me in the eyes.  He wanted this but he was ashamed of it.  I kissed his neck, and continued to seduce him until he couldn't keep his hands off me.  We kissed passionately and we fell onto the hospital bed and we had slow soft sex.  Very much the opposite of what I had just done with Tony.

When he finished he pulled himself away from me with a look of horror.  He pulled his clothes on and stalked out of the room and ran into Tony on his way out.  He glared at him, "You told her didn't you."

"I told her you needed a little bit too."

Tristan looked at him with heat, "A little bit of what?  Sex?  Sex isn't meaningless to me."

Tony shrugged, "It's not the same for her either.  But she felt your need.  How long has it been Trist?"

Tristan punched Tony in the chest, "That's not fair.  She loves you.  She can't love me, don't you get that."

"Trist, she doesn't love me either.  She trusts me.  She cares for me.  She has honor, duty and obligation to me.  She's family.  It's not love Tristan.  She doesn't know how to love."  Tony pleaded with Tristan.

"How can she not love, everyone can."  He was angry.

Tony spoke softly, "How can a girl who's lost her family to a fire, who has been raped before the age of ten, who was taught to steal thing she needed and then used for a sex toy supposed to know how to love.  She's never been loved, not when she needed it."  Tristan stared at him in horror then looked back at me with pain in his eyes.  Tony forced Tristan to look at him, "She doesn't love me.  She needs me.  I need her.   Sex is nothing more than sex with her.  What you did with her back in the place between worlds. That is trust.  She trustd you."   Tony was getting angry.  "She let you comfort her when I wasn't there.  You think that made me happy.  That I was pissed off at her and I couldn't be what she needed.  You were there Trist.  I'm not mad you did what you did, I'm mad it wasn't me.  I'm angry at myself for being an ass when she needed me.  I love her.  I love you.  Let it be enough."

Tristan stared at Tony and then back at me.  "When she slept in my arms I saw her dreams.  She dreamt of a little boy on a fountains edge.  He mouthed something I couldn't hear what it was."

I smiled and recited, "T O N Y".

Tristan looked at me as if he'd just remembered I was sitting there.  He turned back to Tony, "She dreams about you."

I grabbed Tristan's hand and made him look at me, "Only one other person can get into my dreams like that who isn't forcing their way in."

Tony touched Tristan's shoulder, "She trusts you.  She trusted you the moment you took her pain into yourself.  You had no regard for your own safety.  You didn't know what it meant.  You didn't understand the connection you made with her.  She's given you everything she can.  She'll give you everything you need."

Eve pulled the curtain away, "I know you all are having an intimate moment but she needs to sleep, so ya'll need to chill and pick this up later."

Tony looked at Eve with a smile, "If we let her sleep can we stay?"  

Eve looked at me and smiled, "Yeah if you let her sleep."

Tony closed the curtain after Eve left and lay down at my back.  I still held Tristan's hand and looked up at him.  Tony smiled at him.  "It's sleep Trist."

He looked at the two of us in bed and turned to walk away.  I pulled him back and he turned to look at me with pained eyes.  I pulled him closer and he moved slowly towards us.  I pulled him close enough to kiss his hand.  He looked at me with the look of an abused puppy.  I pulled his shirt and he moved had no choice but to come closer.  I kissed him softly on the lips and he relaxed into my arms.  We slept.   both men holding me. It started to be a very peaceful sleep.

I dreamt of the little boy on the water fountain.  The dream morphed and the boy became two boys.  I knew that wasn't my memory.  And then I saw them.  I watched as I pulled apart men and women.  I saw myself rip out the throats of a little boy.  I dropped a girl's lifeless form.  I watched I did not feel, like I always felt.  I shot awake and saw a man standing over us.  He'd done this before.  He protected his fears on to me.  His hands were above his head and one of my bloody daggers was plunging its way towards us.  I grabbed Tony's sword.  I knew it was there even if I couldn't see it.  The ring of metal was a wonderful sound and the sword move swiftly through the man's heart.  I cried out in pain and woke Tristan from his sleep.  Tony was already scrambling behind me searching for a weapon.  Christopher cried out with pain as fire engulfed him.    Out of the corner of my eye I saw a man shimmer from sight.  "Virgil"  

Tony checked the room but the man was not here, "It was a dream?"

I nodded but I didn't have time to say anything as the smell of burning flesh became too much.  I quickly turned and wretched on the floor.  Eve came running into the room "What is that awful smell?"

In between heaves I got out, "Burning spy."

Eve looked at Tony, "Is she always that sensitive to smells?"

Tony shook his head, "No, just that one.  When she was human she was a vegetarian.  Ironic huh?"

Eve looked confused, Tristan answered to my surprise, "Her family burnt to death in a fire."  He looked up at Tony, "The smell of burning flesh was burned into her mind."  Tony nodded.  

"She never stays to watch a body burn, she knows it'll burn and not get anything else unless she loses control of the fire."

Eve smiled and patted my head, "At least she hasn't eaten much to empty out."

# Making Plans

Francesco walked in with Tristan sitting on one side of me and Tony on the other side.  He laughed, "Well I didn't expect this.  I suppose it fits with your plans Tristan."

I looked up at Tristan, he smiled, "I talked with Francesco about being Chevalier."

I asked, "Whose?"

He smiled, "Does it matter now?"

I laughed, "Yes and no."

He looked up at Tony, "Before, you said something."  

Tony smiled, "I was wondering when you were going to ask."  He leaned over me and kissed Tristan with a passion that made Francesco squirm a little.  I smiled at the two men.  "That clears it up."

Tristan looked breathlessly back at me and smiled, "Why yes and no?"

"If you join us you die when we die.  If you join another you live when we die, but you die when they die."  It was fact he had to understand.

Tony laughed, "What she's trying to say is.  Your life is tied to the one you join.  But what I think what she wanted to know which of the two of us you had intended to ask."

Tristan looked embarrassed and Tony patted his hand.  "It's okay to choose her.  She's the one that can sustain more than I can.  And my people frown on it."

Francesco cleared his throat.  "We have other plans if you three have time.  The surveillance came in."

Eve looked over at us, "There is another problem."

I stood up and tried to find some clothes.  Eve handed me a clean pair of jeans and a t-shirt.  Not my style, but it would work.  I got dressed and Francesco guffawed and turned around.  "What sort of problem?"

I pulled the shirt over my head, "Virgil employed Christopher and he tried to kill us."

"Why didn't alarms raise?" 

We shrugged, and Francesco hurried out of the room.  "We need to move faster now."

I followed and the men stammered behind me.  But they followed quickly.

Everyone who mattered was already in the room they used for meetings like this.  Aurora smiled at me and then frowned when she saw the two men absently grab my hands from behind.  She watched us for a few quick seconds before smiling.  She got up from the table and hugged Tristan and whispered, "Welcome to the family."  He smiled.

Francesco put his arm around Aurora, "Didn't expect that did you?"

She smiled up at her man, "She's happy, that's what matters."  She looked at us, "They are happy."  She pursed her lips, "Let get these bastards."  I had never seen the venom in her eyes before.  She really wanted to make a strike at them that hurt.

They sat and talked about the layout, where my family was being held.  I stood in the back listening, watching.  Everyone was involved in the meeting.  I'd seen everything I needed to I was about to leave when Tony looked up.  "NO"

I stopped mid step.  He grabbed my arm, "You won't do this alone again."

Tristan looked at us with confusion.  Tony waggled a finger at Tristan.  He got up and he slit my wrist with his fingernail.  He offered my wrist to Tristan.  Tristan looked confused.  Tony was angry at me, "I can't control her alone.  I need your help."  

I looked at Tristan, "He's telling you to drink.  Become Lesser now."

Tristan nodded with understanding and I bit his wrist and said the words that formed the magic and just like that Tristan popped into my head.  I could feel his hunger.  I pulled my wrist away, "You need to eat more.  We'll kill each other."

Tony laughed, "Well I guess that means it worked."

Tristan grabbed my hand and pulled me to the table.  "What were you going to do?"  

Aurora laughed, "She was going to go in and rescue her friends without anyone else, what else?"

Tristan glared at her, "No I meant, how?  I knew she was going in alone, she sees something we are missing."

"You think like humans."

He stood up offended.  Tony tried to clarify, "She means..."

"I mean you think with only human weapons in mind."

"That's all we have."

"No it's not.  You have Primeval Vampires who can walk into shadows and come out someplace else."

Tristan nodded, "Yeah we tried that they seem to have their shadows guarded."

"With silver bullets?"

Tristan shook his head, "Only the most important people over there get silver."

I smiled and Tristan understood.  "You meant to just walk in and let them shoot you."

I nodded, Tony laughed, "She did it before."

I took a red pen and marked the offices of the important people.  "Silver is here then."  I moved one of the little figures they were using for our side and put it a place that was always shadow and I moved one to the shadows closet to where they were holding my family.  "We come in here and here.  I will be here."  I pointed to the closest to my family, "The rest serve as a distraction.  Only fast healers get to go."  I put my hand on Tristan's chest and pushed him to his seat, "You stay here."

He stood up, "No way.  You aren't keeping me here."

Tony smiled, "Stay with her, and do not leave her side for even a moment.  She'll make sure you live."  He turned to the rest of them.  "I'll provide distraction.  Who else?"

Alex and David volunteered.

"In and out, nothing fancy."  Tristan took over again.

# Into The Trenches

And the plans were made and we would move at first light.  Attacking during the day would be unexpected.  We had a few hours to kill.  Tristan, Tony and myself found ourselves in Tony's room, not really knowing where to go from here.

I lay on the bed my knees hanging over the edge, Tony stood staring into the wardrobe closet trying to decide what he wanted to wear.  So girly.

Tristan stood against the door.  "And now it's awkward."

Tony smiled, "Only for you. because you aren't use to her."

"What do you mean?"

"It's not about the sex and all you want is sex right now."  Tony smiled.

"You feel that?"  Tristan blushed.

"He wants you."  I told Tony.

Tony turned around to see Tristan's bright red blush.  Tony walked over to his friend and kissed him.  "I don't have a backdoor."  Tristan nodded, "I do.  And her?"

Tony kissed him again before turning him and pushing him to the bed, "Whatever you want.  You'll get that soon or later."

Tristan looked over and me and pulled my head to his and he kissed me.  He bit my tongue and blood welled into his mouth.  I bit his lip and he gave a small cry of pleasure.  Tony crawled on top of Tristan naked.  

Tristan sat up and kissed Tony then pulled off his shirt.  He crawled over to me and undressed me.  He kissed me and pulled off his pants before sliding inside me.  Tony took advantage of the position and Tristan gave a moan of pure pleasure.  He wanted this badly.  He wanted to be accepted for what he was.  And we did.

We changed position so I was in the middle.  Tristan at my back and Tony to the front.  Tony came and he lay down and watched Tristan and me.  Tristan was straining, "It's okay Trist, finish."  Tony got up on his knees and kissed Tristan over my arched body, "She won't finish that way.  I'll show you how."  Tristan came and He fell to his side taking me with him.  

Tony bit my stomach and I shuttered in pleasure.  Tristan bit me, following Tony's lead.  I whispered, "Harder."  

Tony licked my stomach in complaint to being instructed; He looked over at Tristan along my body, "Make her bleed."  Tony leaned back to watched Tristan bite me.  He bit hard enough to break the skin, he did it again and again until I convulsed under him.  He bit again, I breathed out "Stop."

He bite again and I cried "Stop"

He didn't stop and he bit again.  I felt the beast well out over me, my voice went quiet and unused, I croaked "Stop".

Tony pulled Tristan from me and moved to catch me by my hair.  I wanted blood, I wanted Tristan's blood.  Tony reached around and snapped my neck.

An hour or so later I woke up with a pain in my neck and fully clothed, underwear included.  I felt the bed bounce as Tony sat down, "She's awake."

Tristan leaned over to me, "I'm sorry.  I didn't know."

He looked up at Tony, "Yeah I know, she never says anything she doesn't mean.  I'll remember that.  But what happened?"

Tony explained while I inspected the clothes I was in.  "There is a fine line between blood lust and sexual lust.  She can cross it easily.  You just pushed her over the edge is all.  It's okay we've all done it."

I looked in the mirror and smiled at the outfit.  "Jack in particular."

"She um, with Jack."  Tristan asked.

Tony blushed, "Jack likes pain, and they both get off on aspects of it.  Jack won't stop getting hurt, she won't stop hurting him, and when he is talked into hurting her, he can't stop hurting her because she won't say the stop word."

"Is that his payment?"  Tristan was learning our dynamic quickly.

I shook my head.  "It's a rare treat; we aren't allowed to be alone with each other, ever."

Tristan blushed, "So someone has to watch."

"It's not sex, i's torture. Just because we get off on it doesn't mean we have sex."

Tristan's mouth formed an O.  I turned and kissed his open mouth, he returned the simple message.

I cocked my head at Tony and looked at Tristan.  'You didn't?"

"I did."  Tony smiled.

"He did what?"  Tristan asked.

"Tony mated with you.  He took you for life."

"What's that mean?"

"To you nothing, if you were a female primeval vampire he could get you pregnant."  

Tony laughed, "We'd be famous."

Tristan smiled, "You didn't ask?"

I put my hand on his chest, "He has no control over it."

"Sorry dude, it happens on a biological level.  Sierra's gone you were the next love of my life.  She don't count ‘cause I'm already mated to her."

Tristan was confused again.

"I can mate for life with one primeval woman.  Since she cannot imprint back I was open for Sierra, when Sierra died my connections were opened again and I imprinted on you.  You can't imprint back so I can do it again - on accident if I'm not careful.  So you and her are my only partners from now on."

I looked at Tristan, "But that doesn't mean you can't have another in your life too.  We will be together a long time."

Tristan frowned, "I guess I'm the mate for life type."

I smiled, "You'll get bored.  They always do."

"She's lost many a lesser to a love affair."  Tony was saddened by that fact but he knew it was life.  "And if you really want to be chevalier, you'll be with her for life, there is no turning back."

Tristan nodded.  "But not right now."  We both smiled at him and said, "Not now."

There was a knock at the door and Aurora opened it slowly, "I know you all aren't doing anything but are you decent?"

Tristan called out, "Yes ma'am."

Aurora walked in, "You ready? It's almost time."

We nodded and got up and followed Aurora to the staging ground.  Tristan looked at Tony, "In and out, nothing fancy."

Tony looked at me, "You hear that."

I sighed.  I took Tristan's hand and Tony took Alex and David's, and we stepped into the shadows.

It was dark, everything was dark.  I blinked and still everything was dark.  I heard the first gun go off and I stepped in front of Tristan.  I pulled my sword out and Tristan handed me a second.  "I thought this would be more useful than a dagger."  I took it graciously but didn't look back.  I stepped forward and Tristan followed with his back against mine.  He held a gun and was ready to shoot anyone he saw from behind.  I was impressed with his technique, I hadn't thought about it.  I sliced through the first man with ease.  The second man started to run away when he saw the sword coming for him.   In a whirl of speed we took out the firing line.  It was easy, probably too easy.  

Tristan stayed behind me as we moved through the complex to where my family waited.  I followed the pain where it took me and took out vampires and men when threatened.  The room they were in was guarded by two gnarly vampires.  I didn't have a chance to slice them before Tristan shot them in the head with one shot each.  Silver to the brain, they'd be out for a while.

I kicked in the door and was overwhelmed by the stench of death and decay.  I took a deep breath and walked in to find the five of them hanging with their insides on the outside.  Tristan covered the door.  

I took another deep breath.  Allison was first.  She hung by a thread of life.  My life was the only think keeping her alive.  She whispered, "Just kill me.  Please kill me."  I could barely hear her, her throat was raw.  I kissed her softly on the cheek before chopping off her head.   I stumbled.

Tristan turned to see her head roll.  "What are you doing?"

"What she asked.  They don't want to live."

Tristan came to my side, "But, we came to save them."

"I am."  He hesitated before leaving me alone.

Larry whispered to me.  "He's in a public meeting now.  Kill him."  I nodded.  He kissed me.  "I'm ready."

I snapped his neck and stumbled again.

Tristan helped me to my feet.  Doc nodded and a tear slid down my cheek as I ran my sword through and cut off his head.  I fell.

Tristan watched me as I stood back up.  I beheaded Terry in a quick motion before falling to my knees in pain.

I struggled to get to my feet.  I saw Jack hanging; he had a smile on his face.  "Thank you for coming."  Tears fell from my eyes and I handed the swords to Tristan.  I took my daggers from my sleeves and I crossed my arms and made a huge gapping X in Jacks chest before turning them into their sheaths, I kissed Jacks forehead before ripping his head off with my hands.  I fell to the ground in a mass of tears.

I didn't bother to struggle to my feet I just grabbed Tristan's hand and crawled into the rendezvous point.  Tony didn't ask, he'd felt everything.  Alex and David looked surprised to only see us.  "She never intended to rescue them, did she?"  Tristan asked.  Tony shook his head.  

My the time I saw what I was looking for my strength was back.  "I have a promise to fulfill."

Tristan looked up, "No, you can't.  He's protected."  He grabbed for me, but I stepped into the shadows behind the General who had tortured my friends for the past twelve years.  I grabbed his head and I twisted until it came off in my hands.  I was fast, but the bullet aimed at my head was silver and I collapsed to the ground with his head in my hands.  It was the last thing I remembered before the darkness.

# Babes In Waiting

I woke to bright lights and loud beeping noises.  I blinked the haze away, but found it difficult to do anything but breathe. I tried to sit up, I heard a female voice call out, "She's awake."

Eve shined a bright light in my eyes and helped me to sit up.  "You scared us."  She turned to her nurse, "Get Tristan and Tony."  

A hand grabbed mine and squeezed, I turned to look and found Aurora's smiling face beaming back at us, "We are glad to have you back.  We have much to discuss dear one, very much."

I felt uncomfortable and I tried to straighten my gown and found something highly unexpected.  "What the hell?"

Aurora laughed, "Like you don't know how that happens."

"We would never have let you go if we'd known you were with child."  

I shook my head, "How long has it been?"

Tony walked in with a bright smile and Tristan was close on his heals.  "Nearly nine months."

I looked down and my huge belly.  Tristan smiled and kissed me on my forehead, "Care to know what you are having?"

I blinked, Tony laughed, "She can't believe we knocked her up on the first night."

"We?" I asked surprised.

Eve took my hand, "You are having twins.  And we tested early and it seems one for each father.  You my girl are very fertile for an undead vampire."

I lay back in shock.  "What happened?"

Aurora sat forward, "Well, you and the boys here had sex."  I glared at her and she smiled, "Not that, then what?"

"You were shot in the head with a silver bullet."  Eve explained, "Your body couldn't maintain the pregnancy AND heal you at the same time.  So your instincts were to shut down and heal and grow and feed off of your Chevalier, and the blood we infused into you.  But because the babes are living these, four have been eating us out of house and home without a second look back."  

I nodded, "And the General?"

Eve smiled and let Tony answer.  "You killed him.  The refinery was freed.  Your impromptu invasion gained us a few powerful allies and we saved many more human.  The vampires are all in a special prison so they won't cause us anymore harm." 

Tristan added, "You are wanted for the death of the General.  I hear it's a great mansion in the promised land and a high place among the powerful."

I looked at them.  "He's dead then, and I'm wanted for his assassination."  I smiled.  "And all I'm worth is choice house."

Tony laughed, "And a place of high esteem among the New Order.  We have quite figured out what that means."

I looked to Tristan he was nearly hopping on the bed, I looked up at Tony, "New parent."  I smiled at Tristan, "Well tell me."

He looked like he'd been given a big prize, "Girls."

I nodded.  I looked to Eve, "And?"

She patted my hand, "They are both healthy. They hold hands."

"Do we know anything else?" I asked cautiously I didn't want to hurt Tristan's feelings.  Even shook her head, "We don't know.  They'll be here soon.  Or I don't think you would have woken up.  We were worried about labor."

"So I'm here till they are?"  

Tristan nodded and Tony laughed, "Stuck in bed girl friend."

Aurora smiled, "But we can all talk about our plans."

I looked at Aurora with curiosity; Francesco stepped in from behind my men.  "An army of Chevalier, Vampires and Therians."

I blinked at Francesco, "I can't take that many on."  

He smiled, "Anyone who can sustain one will take one.  And if they can do more, we'll do more."

"That's a bit dangerous."  I said, it was way too dangerous.

"It is.  But it's no more dangerous than sending in unprepared humans to their slaughter; this will give everyone we send a fighting chance."

I shrugged, I wasn't a statistician.  I didn't know the theory of war; I only knew how to kill.

"I told you she wouldn't care."  Tony quipped at his father.  He turned to me, "But you need to teach us to work like a team.   I watch Ryan and Ant and I see perfection.  We need that for everyone we send in.  They work their butts off trying to teach it, but we need you."

"What am I teaching?  I can't teach anything about working with firearms."  

Tony smiled, "We've a black smith, forging an arsenal of silver plated weapons."

I blinked in surprise and then cried out in pain.

Eve hurried to me and checked my most private parts.  "They are coming.  Everyone out but family."  No one left.  Eve sighed, "Stupid request wasn't it."  She focused on me and said push.  "I did as ordered."  

And in minutes later the girls were gracing the world with their presence.  They were held by one of their fathers while Eve finished with me.  They cried heartily.  I couldn't think, "They're cold."

Tristan looked at me, "How do you know? All I feel is fear."

I held out my arms for the girl in Tristan's arms, "She's cold.  I held her to my chest and covered her with the blanket over me and her crying stopped.  The other one stopped crying too.

Tony looked at the other baby and back at the one in his arms.  "This one is not giving me any vibes."

Eve took the babe from Tony and handed her to me.  "I think they'll do better together."  The newest babe snuggled against her sister.  They held hands.  "See."  Eve looked at me, "If ya'll name then now can I take them and run some test.  I promise I won't hurt them.  I feel Cari's questions they are strong she won't be able to focus on what ya'll need to do."

I looked at Tony and Tristan.  Tristan smiled, "We have names picked out if you like them."

I waited for them to tell me.  They were enjoying making me wait.  Tristan spoke first.  "Morgan."  He touched the one he had held first.  Tony nodded, "And Carissa."

I blinked at him.  "You didn't think I'd remember?"

I shook my head, he smiled, "No one calls you that, it's a pretty name."

Tristan touched the other little girl.  I looked up at Eve, "Morgan and Carissa.  Can you remember which is which?."

She laughed and wrote on a piece of paper and slipped it on the bracelet I had failed to notice, "Morgan Marshall-Giovanni."

I looked up at them with a peaked interest.  Tristan laughed, "I didn't know the two of you had shared a last name with not even being married."

Tony said, "The irony of it."

Eve placed the second paper in the bracelet of the second little one; I read the paper "Carissa Marshall-Giovanni".

I picked up Carissa first and Morgan started to cry.  Eve took one her and handed her to the nurse behind her.  I handed her Morgan and looked up at Eve, "She's cold."

"You really feel what she feels?"  

"I can't explain it."  

Ant chose that time to come see his sisters.  He kissed their foreheads, "She's the same way with me.  It's a mother thing."

Tony shook his head, "No it's a Cari thing. Sierra never could read the kids.  She hated that I knew what they wanted more than she did.  But I can't read those two."

# New Chevalier

Ant smiled at me, "News spreads like wildfire these days.  Probably a good thing most people believe you are dead huh?"  I smiled back, "I was told to come see if you strong enough to inspect the troops."

Francesco smiled, "Before any become lesser and then more, you have to approve pairings, in any way you see fit."

I sighed but looked up at Eve before she left with the girls.  She nodded, "I'm surprised you even asked."

Tony laughed, "She's not stupid Doc.  Speaking of Doc, Eve, you like Cari's bite right?"

Eve blushed.  Tony smiled and continued, "She needs to start a new family, Il Mandria di Cane, needs to be replenished.  She can't go on like she has been.  She can't hunt, and she won't ask for food."  Tony wrote on a piece of paper, "She'll pay you this yearly."  

Eve blinked, "And if money doesn't come back into play?"

"Then we'll work out some other form of compensation."

"Why me?"  She asked.

"You are a doctor of course; you see she gets herself into a lot of trouble.  You'd be able to add to your knowledge with more schooling, you'd be able to do any research you like other than curing vampirism."  

She looked at me, "And Therianthropy?"

I smiled, "That's fine."

"Okay.  Sounds like a good proposal for giving you a few pints of blood a week."  She blushed, "Always like that?"

"If you want it that way."

"Would I feed him?"

Tony spoke first, "No.  I don't partake of her family unless there is dire need."

"Yeah, I'll go with okay.  What do I have to do?"  Eve was curious.

"We'll do it after the ceremony has been done for everyone else.  We don't want you caught with me forever if you don't want it."  I looked around for something to wear.  Aurora handed me a bag with clothes in it.  

Eve looked a bit relieved.  "Okay.  I'll go run those tests now.  You can go play inspector."

I sighed as I pulled out the clothes.  Aurora had chosen well.  She smiled at me, "My step son over there picked it out, not me."  I raised my eye brow at her in question.  "Franky proposed and we got married while you slept."  I looked shocked I could tell from her smile, "Marie is happily seeing some human.  Everyone's happy."

I pulled the gown off and Francesco turned to walk out with disgust.  Aurora laughed, "He's such a prude."  She left with him.

I got dressed quickly and followed Francesco and Aurora to the new training center in the heart of the compound.

I stopped just shy of the doorway.  I took a deep breath and walked through the door followed by Tristan, Tony, Ant and Ryan.  Ryan kissed my cheek as he passed, "Good to have you back."

Ryan stepped in front of the men and women waiting.  "You've been training for a while.  Today you get to show your stuff.  Prove you can do what she says."  He pointed to me.  "And work together and you get to keep your pairings for life."

In the mix of people in front of me I saw Dimitri and Damian.  I was surprised to see Aurora and Francesco in formation as well.  Tristan and Tony fell in line together with Alex.  Ryan and Ant stood in front of the room and called out instructions.  I got to sit back and watch the class.  

And with a start they started working in their warm ups, all in unison.  Everything was perfectly in unison.  I watched for deviations but it was boring.  I looked bored Ant came over to me.  "I know I'm sorry, but we don't want them to get hurt."  

Ten minutes later they were standing in their pairings in two lines facing one another.  I had to stop them.  "Ryan, I can't watch them all at the same time."  

Ryan shouted, "First pairing, the rest fall back and watch.  Unless you all think you can take her on." 

There was an eager cheer.  They wanted to get hurt it seemed.

"Rules?" I asked.

"Don't kill them,"  Ant laughed. 

"How do you win?"  

He nodded, "Ah.  He handed me a pair of wraps.  Killing blow.  This marks every hit you land.  Ry and I'll watch for killing blows."

I nodded and got up from the wall.  "Can I choose who I want to try first?"

Ryan laughed, "Yeah sure."

I looked over at the threesome I had tied to me through metaphysics.  They smiled.  "On guard."

Murmurs ran through the class, "She's not even warming up."  "Of course she picked them."

Ryan spoke over the class, "You all wonder why she choose her family first?"  They all said yes.  "Anyone care to enlighten them."

Aurora spoke up, "Because they are going to be the hardest to beat.  They can feel what she feels, and if they understand the link they share, they can read her."

Ryan nodded, "They won't beat her.   Not together anyway.  They've a lot yet to learn, but they will be the most challenging."

Someone in the class yelled, "Is that a bet?  Three on one, I'll take those odds."  More chimed in.  I sighed, then threw my first punch that landed in Tony's gut.  He humphed and then the room was silent.  And the fight was on.

They men circled me in the same direction.  They took turns advancing trying to land a blow I easily dodged.  They bumped into each other a few times.  I kicked Tristan in the stomach and he flew across the room.  I smacked Alex across the head and he fell to the ground in pain.  Ryan and Ant called them dead at least out for the rest of the fight.  Tony smiled at me and he came at me with full force, he didn't trip over them anymore.

Ryan spoke over the cheering, "She just took out his weakest links. Do you want to see the fight?  Or try yourself?"

A chorus of fights went across the room.  It was a playful fight.  I could feel Ryan wanting to get in on it.  Ant was wanting a piece of the action as well. They wanted the fight.  I smiled and nodded to them.  And they jumped to their feet.  The three circled me like they'd done it a million times before.  They worked together before.  They'd fought me before and none had won.  

An hour went by and no one had landing a killing blow.  The rules had changed the moment they stepped into the ring.  It was death by broken neck, we all knew the rules.  Ant went down first when he got too close to me.  Ryan was felled by his own momentum and I snapped his neck with ease.  Tony was left standing.  He bowed out.  I nodded and the fight was over.

Aurora asked, "Why bow out?"

"Someone needs to continue with the class.  Unless you want to put this off?"  Aurora shook her head.

Tony called out "Next."  The two in front of the line attacked and Tony yelled at me over the crowd.  "Don't kill them."

They bum-rushed me and I laid my hands on either side of the first man and he was called out, the other I caught with my knee and brought his buddy over his back which would have snapped it had it been for real.  He was called out.

Another attacked and they lost, one after the other they tried to beat me.  It became chaos.  I stood up and pressed my power out and stopped everyone dead in their tracks.

Ant groggily spoke, "She's had enough of the one on one attacks.  This is a team exercise. Ya'll have a lot to learn."

I walked out of the room, "They all pass."  I was tired of their games.

# The Execution

The class filed out behind me with murmurs of greatness of how this would be awesome, they couldn't wait.  Tristan and Tony caught up to me and put their arms around me.  Ant, Ryan and even Alex fell in behind us.  Aurora yelled down the hall, "Cari"

I stopped and turned and the men behind me parted so I could see her.  Aurora bowed nearly to the ground in practiced fluidity.  I returned the bow but to a much lesser extent and turned around and started walking with a smile on my face.  "Never expected that."

"She's respected your skills from the start.  She talked Sal into letting you keep your swords and use them."  I nodded knowing all too well that fight.  I sighed knowing I'd have to kill Sal someday soon.

"How do we turn them to Chevalier?"

Tristan skipped with pleasure. "This way."

He took us into the deepest parts of the compound and lit a torch for his eyes to see.  It caught me off guard.  I blinked in the new brightness.  "Prisoners of War."

I looked at the men tied with their hands behind their backs and what use to be white rags tied around their mouths.  "We've been collecting them."

"We only need one."  I turned to him.  

He nodded, "We are being safer rather than sorry."

"When can we do this?"

"I need to feed then any time after I see the girls."  Tristan smiled brightly at me.  He offered me his wrist.  I smiled at him, then looked at Tony, "Who's gonna handle the schedule?"

"We'll find someone but I'll remember for now."  Tony pushed me towards Tristan.

I pulled him closer to me with his outstretched arm.  He understood what I wanted, he picked me up and I wrapped myself around him then bit into his supple neck.  His knees shook and then he steadied he closed his eyes and hugged me tighter to him.  It wasn't about sex, it was about comfort.

Tony hugged us both and helped me down when I lifted my head.  We had been left by the rest of the family only the prisoners watched.  They watched with horror on their eyes wondering if they were going to be next.  I jumped at them and they all fell backwards. I smiled and left.  Tristan and Tony rolled their eyes at me.  I laughed just a little bit harder.  They laughed.

We walked back to the infirmary, Eve was rocking one of the girls, and a nurse was cuddling another.

She smiled at us as we walked in.  "They've been eating well."

She handed the little one in her arms to Tristan, and picked up her wristband, "Yep.  Morgan."  As if she was reassuring herself she had it right.  The nurse handed Tony Carissa.  Eve pulled up a chair, this didn't look good.

She smiled, "It is okay nothing's wrong.  Though I'm not sure of the ramifications.  They both hold Primeval DNA, which shouldn't be the case as their mother doesn't have any at all.  Carissa is mostly human, but she seems to be linked to her sister like a Chevalier is linked to a vampire."  

Tony nodded, "So Morgan is like Ant."

Eve nodded, "With a Chevalier."

Ant stared at his little sister, "Already showing me up huh?"  he looked over at Carissa, "Lucky duck."

Eve looked up at Tony, "You taking Chevalier?  I'd like to take samples before and after if you are."

"I hadn't thought about it.  I have no one I'd want to be bound to for the rest of my life."

He looked at Tristan, "Expect y'all."

I watched Tony while he thought about it, I said softly, "You're Dad is joining the forces in class.  I think he'll let you slide too.  Take Tristan."

Tony shook his head, "No, you two already work together well.  He told me what went down when you two were alone in the oil refinery.  I don't think we'll have it.  We are too much alike."

I shrugged, "It's the two of yours call."

Alex stepped forward, "I can if you can break this bond we share already.  I was going to become Chevalier anyway, but I'll take up arms with Tony, we've been training as if we were going to be anyway."

"We'll have to ask Dimitri."  And he strode into the room with a grin.

"And Il Cane calls.  Once it was the other way around dear, just remember that."  He rubbed the hair on my head, "Little beauts you have.  What can I do for you?"

Alex answered with conviction.  "Can we undo what I did?"

Dimitri looked at me, "You know better than I do."   He turned to the panther before him, "It'll hurt like hell.  This isn't a lesser bond, it is for life, but it can be undone.  She knows how, she taught me."

Tony and Tristan asked "Why?"

Dimitri frowned, "Edmund wanted to leave me once many years ago.  Cari found something in her research and she taught me how.  But I never did it."

Alex looked at me, "Why did you need to ask him?"

"I'm not an Animal Ken master, I know only what I found.  I can't undo something  I know little about."

"Is she always like that?  So cold and distant."  Alex was almost disgusted.

Tristan nodded, "Yep."  I smiled he was getting the hang of it.

Alex looked at me with relief, he was glad to be gone from my me.  "So do it."

I nodded "Open yourself to your beast.  Just on the verge of turning."

He looked at me, "It won't make me change will it."

"No you'll pass out."  I turned to Tony, "You got me?"

He nodded and handed Ant the baby.  "You and Trist get them out of here, everyone else needs to leave too.  Eve you can stay to look after Alex, but you'll have get him out of here too, she may not be in control."

Alex looked up at me, "What's about to happen?"

Ant had handed Ryan the baby and he was walking out.  "She's about to let lose her evil side."  He turned to me, "I'll help Eve get him out of here."

I nodded and closed my eyes.  I could feel Alex's beast on the edge of turning.  I grabbed what looked like a leash in my mind and I unlocked the cage in my mind and pulled the leash apart from both of them.  It snapped with a pop that only I could hear.  I raced to lock the door but I was too late the anger and the blood lust rose to a deafening crescendo.

I could hear doors slamming and I could hear only one heart beat in front of me.  Tony stood ready to take me down.  I scrambled in my mind to tether the beast inside me.  I pulled with all my might.  I dragged the beast by the fur.  Fur?  I pulled it until I could push it back.  I pushed and I pushed and the door slammed shut.  I collapsed to my knees.

Tony didn't know what to do.  He stared at me until I passed out.

I woke in the infirmary with little ones lying on my chest; I tried not to stir too much for fear of them falling off.  Tristan put a hand on one and Tony the other.  Tony looked at me as he helped me sit up so I could cradle both the girls.  

Tristan smiled, "You started to wake up the moment they touched you."

Tony looked concerned, "What the hell was that?"

I shook my head.  "I didn't want to hurt you.  I fought the beast instead."

He blinked at me, "And it worked?"

"Apparently.  How long have I been out?"  I asked, it didn't feel like long.

"Only for a few minutes.  The girls started crying and the only thing that would make them stop was being closer to you.  We laid them down and you woke up."  Tristan laughed, "Talk about the touch of a parent."

"Alex okay?"

Eve peaked around the curtain, "He's fine doll, though I think he reneged on being part of ya'll."

"That's okay."  

Tristan patted Tony's arm, "We can do it.  Me and you.  She's enough people in her head."

"You sure?"  Tristan nodded.  "Cari?"

I found the place in my mind and kissed Tristan good-bye and the link was gone.  He stepped back, "Damn that was easier than I thought."

I smiled and Eve looked on with relief, "So it'll be that easy."

I nodded, "Without the kiss, of course."

She laughed, "I could have dealt with that." 

Tony smiled at Tristan, "You still wanna feed her?"

Tristan smiled, "Of course, that cool."

Tony laughed, "I would be feeding on you for anything more than pleasure anyway."  Tristan blushed, Tony laughed.

Tony smiled, "Two down.  Four more to go."

Eve looked at them, "Keep them human.  We found she went into withdrawl on Therian blood when she was pregnant."  

"Good to know.  I can do the rest if everyone is ready."

Everyone looked to Eve, "You heard the woman." she smiled.

I handed the girls to their fathers and they started to whimper softly.  Tristan sighed, "They won't let us hold them right now."  

I smiled and pulled together a sheet on the next bed and made a make shift sling for two.  I took Carissa from Tony and placed her on the left, and Morgan on the right.  I made sure my sword hand was free the sword easily freed of the bindings and smiled.

Tony and Tristan nodded, "There we go.  Babies to go."  Tristan laughed at Tony's joke.

We all gathered together in the prisoner's room.  I drew the symbols needed on the floor and Tony and Tristan lifted the prisoners into the circle as instructed.  

I looked over at the crowd; it was large for being so few of us.  "Vampires make lesser chevalier."  The room was full of their magic.  Moments later the magic faded and the men sneered up at me.  Vampires touch me then stand behind me."  They made a line and did as instructed.  When the line was finished, "The rest of you say, 'And with you I give my soul.  Bind me forever with my master as you pass unto death.' Then touch a man at my feet."  

Tristan was first, "Spread it out people, let's be smart about it."

"Everyone done?"  No one said anything just nodded their heads.  I looked down at the men before me and drew my sword.  "And with your deaths I bind thee."  In one motion, the five heads fell from their bodies.  Their blood spread across the symbols on the ground the magic bubbled and then it was done.  An army of Chevalier.

# The Meaning Of Love

More than two dozen men and women walked in with a mortal soul and walked out an immortal army.  Human,  vampire and therian alike, were now what The CHSB rested their faith on.  They rested their faith on me training them to be a team, I don't think I can do it, but Tristan and Tony say I can, I'll believe them until I fail.

We all had a lot of things to do before tomorrow.  The evening dawned the first day of their real training.  Tristan and Tony were off trying to find willing food for me.  Neither wanted to leave me but I could handle myself with two little ones, I wasn't incapable of being a parent.

Eve walked me to the room we'd live in.  "It used to be a room for four or five women, but they said they'd give you all the bigger space and moved into Tony's old room.  And one had Alec and Valentine take down their handy work and moved in to your closet."  She smiled, "It really was a closet."  I nodded.

"They've set everything up, you shouldn't need me.  Unless you want me to stay?"  Eve asked.

I shook my head, "I'm fine really.  You want to do this now?"

She did a double take, "Oh, you mean?  Now?"

"Why not it won't take long and we are here now."  

She shrugged, "Sure.  And I'd do this for free as long as you let me do my own research."  I nodded, she smiled, she offered me her wrist and I cut a fine line in mine.  She looked at me and nodded, "Oh.." A deep breath, "kay".  She drank.  I said a few words then drank myself.  I felt Eve floating in the back of my mind.  She smiled at me, "Wow, okay.  That was easy."

I smiled.  "Thank you.  You can go back and do what you do when you don't have a patient."

She laughed and closed the door behind me.  The girls were silently sleeping in their sling.  I pulled Carissa from her pouch and laid her in the crib.  We had two, but there was no need yet, I laid Morgan beside her.  They instant reached for each other's hands.  I smiled and covered the sleeping girls, then sat down in the chair next to their bed.  It was comfortable and I drifted to sleep.

Dreams were always fitful since seeing Virgil appear when I had killed Christopher.  We needed to take him out.  We needed to take all the other side council members.  He might as well be first.

I heard the door start to open and I drew a dagger before realizing it was Tony.  "Everything okay?"  

Tony nodded, "You didn't release Tristan did you?"

"Why?"  I asked.

"Feedback, he doesn't sense it, but I do."  Tony sounded concerned.

"I am blocking his connection to me."   

Tony nodded. "Why didn't you release him?  I'm not mad, but he needs to know."

I nodded.  "Selfish action I guess."  

Tony laughed, "You selfish?  That I find hard to believe."

I looked up at Tony, "He loves you.  I mean really loves you.  I didn't want to let go of that."

He blinked at me with surprise and came over to me.  He wrapped his arms around me with tears in his eyes.  "You really are growing into a real person."

I smacked his hand.  He smiled and whispered in my ear, "He loves you too.  I love you."  He kissed my cheek, "And I know you love me, and you'll love Tristan the same."

I nodded, and turned to look at Tony over my shoulder, "I do love you.  I love the girls, and Ant.  I love Ryan and Mia, and I love Tristan."  Tony smiled at me proud of the announcement.  "He taught me what it was to love someone else.  I've always felt these things, but now I see someone else loving another.  I really feel it.  I couldn't let it go.  I need it as a reminder that I love my family."

Tony was crying. He held me tight.  It wasn't a sob, just happy tears.  Tristan opened the door to find us in the loving embrace, he felt jealous.  I smiled at him and held out my hand to him.  He took it and sat on my lap.  The rocking chair shifted forward with a jerk and Tony smacked his chin on my head.   Tony kissed the top of my head.  I smiled at Tristan, "I love you."

He stared at me with disbelief.  He looked up at Tony.  I could feel Tony nodding his head.  Tristan leaned in and kissed me.  "What brought that on?"

I looked down.  "I didn't let you go, I was being selfish."  I removed the block and I saw his eyes widen.

"Why?"  He was near anger, but he waited to yell at me until I explained.

I gave him the same explanation I gave Tony and Tristan kissed me with more passion that he had before.  I blocked the link again.  

Tristan looked down at me, "Why'd you do that?"

I smiled, "You and Tony need to learn to read each other without me in the way.  When you master that, we can add me into the mix.  I don't play well ask Ryan."

Tony laughed, "He's mentioned that before, actually so has Ant.  They don't like working with you in a team effort."

Tony added, "And why they are usually against you."  I nodded.

"They usually have separate jobs that don't rely on me playing nice."  

I unwound from the men in my life and sat down on the edge of the bed and flopped backwards staring at the ceiling.  I asked to no one in particular, "How did this happen?"

Tony asked, "What happen?"

"The girls."

Tristan chimed in with the physics of the birds and the bees.   

I sat up and glared at him, "I know how that part happened."  I turned to Tony, "Why now?  What did we do?"

Tristan snapped in "This wasn't an accident it was a miracle."

I reached out my hand for him but he refused to take it.  He glared at me.

"It's neither, it's magic, Tristan.  I can't have children, I'm dead."

He stepped back stunned.  Tony stepped between us, "It was probably you fulfilling, " Tony stepped to the side and indicated Tristan, "his desire."

I nodded and looked at Tristan with care, I didn't want to offend him, "You wanted a family?"

"Of course I did, I do."  Tristan was still angry.

"Were you thinking about a family when we all had sex?"  I asked curiously.

Tristan shrugged, "I don't know that was more than nine months ago."

I sighed, "Tristan, I don't want to do this again."  I pointed at the girls.  "I don't want to wind up accidentally pregnant because you want a large family."  Before he could protest, "I do not mind a large family and I will give you want you need eventually, but not right now, if we have sex again will I get pregnant?"

He started to say something but stopped, "I guess I hadn't thought about it like that."

Tony pulled us all together, and he held us both, "You are still understanding our world.  We give you leeway, but you have to trust us."  Tristan nodded and Tony turned to me, "And you need to be less heartless."

I pulled away from Tony and glared at him, then walked out of the door.  I heard Tony sigh, "I shouldn't have said that."  But whatever he said after I didn't hear I was too far out of ear shot.

# Invasion Of Privacy

My temper always got the best of me.  After walking around the compound twice I found myself standing outside the door to our living space.  It felt odd to me knowing that there were four people behind the door that I loved.  I tried to open the door but it was locked.  I knocked softly so not to wake the girls if they slept.

I could hear them whispering behind the door.  Tristan tried to be quiet, really quiet, but I'm a vampire I heard most whispers when I was this close, "She's back."

Tony was the one who opened the door.  "I didn't expect to see you till it was time for you to sleep."

I didn't know what else to say so I said the only thing that I could think of, "I'm sorry."

Tony smiled and stepped out the door, shutting it behind him.  I took a step back and felt the worst was coming. I looked away from Tony.  I hated feeling this way.  Maybe this is why I never loved anyone.  

Tony picked up my chin and made me look at him, "I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said it.  I know you are trying."

I tried to look away.  I wanted to run away.  I hated feeling like this, feeling…

Tony smiled at me, "You hate feeling like a real person."

I sank into his chest.  I hated being this person.  

Tony lifted my chin again and kissed me tenderly.  Something changed, my doors all unlocked at the same time.  I had little control, I pulled away from Tony.  "Can't."  I closed my eyes and I knew what it was.  Someone was in my mind, someone was making me do this.  I grabbed Tony's throat and he stared back at me, "Can't. Control."

I fought to build my shields around me blocking everyone else.  All I wanted to do was rip Tony's throat out.  I fought the tension I fought the suggestion.  I fought with every fiber of my being not to kill him.  From the closed door behind us I heard, "We have them now."

Tony heard it too and he broke my grip on his throat.  I hadn't been easy but he was physically stronger than I was and I was working to do it myself as well, together he managed to escape and he burst through the door.    I heard Tristan say, "Stronger than I thou..."  And then a thud.  I felt the pressure lessen and then was gone.  Everything was fine, everything was locked up and I hadn't done it.  What had happened?  Tristan lay on the bed and the girls were still sound asleep.  I breathed a sigh of relief and then my shock hit and I was furious.  

Tony stepped in my way, "You can't kill him."

I stared up at Tony with coldness in my eyes.  He took a step back, he knew the look, but he knew it wasn't for him.  It was the look you get when you are about to kill someone.  I said to him in a quiet voice.  "Watch me."

He held me at bay, but I never moved.  I just stared at the man we had loved.  "I know only one person capable of doing what just happened."   Tony didn't ask, but I answered anyway, "Valence."

"He's not vampire.  He's human, we know that."  And then a thought occurred to him, "Could he use his Chevalier like that, or a lesser?"

I nodded, "Yeah, he can do it through any one, he's strong in Necromancy, Auspex and Dream walking."  

Tony's mind raced and he caught another detail, "You saw him and not Virgil."

I shrugged, "I don't know.  I can't say for sure it was a fleeting image."

Tony hugged me, "He's the reason you've been so fritzy lately. I'm so sorry. But what are we going to do."

I pulled away from Tony, "I'm going to kill him, and save us."

"How?"  

"Break the bond between him and you and me."  It sounded so simple.  "It's not done because it kills the person doing the breaking."  I looked up at Tony, "I will need help but I think I can use Valence's trick to do it and save us.  But it could go wrong.  Can you live with that possibility?"

Tony smiled, "I'll be dead so I won't have to.  But Yes, I can live with the possibility of our death if he can't hurt anyone else."

I nodded, "I need Alec and Valentine."  I smiled up at him, "And I need you."  Tony picked up Carissa and I picked up Morgan and they slept in our arms while we found the people we needed.

# Breaking Up Is Hard To Do

I turned to Tony, "You take the traitor and I'll take the girls someplace safe."  I stepped on my tip toes and kissed him.  I wanted to melt into him, but we had more important things to do - like killing this bastard.

I took the girls and searched for Mia.  Tony took Tristan to the room where we had tortured Johnny a few weeks ago, or was that all it felt like to me.  It has been more than nine months ago.  I sighed at all the lost time.  But what is time to a vampire?

I found Mia preparing for dinner with Damian, probably the wrong people to hand off the girls too.  I hugged Mia, "I'm sorry, they will sleep for a few hours.  And then I'll be back to get them I promise, as soon as I take care of this."  

Damian walked into the room with a stunned smile on his face.  I smiled at him, "I'm leaving but can you please watch the girls.  They will sleep for the next few hours."

Damian looked at me sternly, "What is going on?"

"We have a traitor in our mist and Tony and I are going to take care of him.  I need someone to watch the girls."  It was the truth, without giving away too much.

Mia smiled, "She doesn't want to say more."

Damian nodded, "I know."  He looked at Mia, "We can watch them, and it might be good practice." 

I blinked at them with surprise.  He smiled, "We are discussing the possibility of adoption."

I smiled and hugged Damian and then Mia, "Thank you.  I will return soon."  And with that I left.

I found Alec and Valentine with what I'd pretty much deemed the new council.  It would have consisted of Tristan and Tony, as well but they were disposed of at the moment.

They were discussing some battle plan or another.  Aurora looked up at me and smiled, "We figured the three of you would be playing house right about now."

I didn't know what to say about that.  "We have a situation.  I need Alec and Valentine."

Francesco stared at me, "And you won't tell us why?"

I shook my head, "You'll try to stop me." I frowned, "Though if things go wrong, Ant, will you take care of the girls?"

Ant looked at me with sad eyes, "Of course, but this can't be good if you are making preparations.  Cari, tell us what's going on.  We promise not to stop you."  

Ryan chimed in, "It'll be easier to explain if we know what really happened."

I sighed, "Okay.  Tristan is a traitor."  The room rose to an incoherent crescendo. I glared at the room, "Shut UP"

They room quieted abruptly.  "Valence was controlling Tristan, and I believe Tristan is at least a lesser chevalier to Valence.  We can't kill him because it'll kill me, Tony, Ryan and Mia.  That's too many you all rely on.  I would gladly sacrifice myself to take him out to keep my family safe.  But I can't do that, so I'm going to make Tristan do it, which is why I need Alec and Valentine."  I raised my voice, "I know I can make Tristan break his own bonds killing him."  And then there was silence.

Francesco spoke first, "But he's Chevalier.  The bond can't be broken."

I smiled, "That is true if you want to survive the break.  One must die, the one who breaks the bond will perish.  There is nothing you can do to stop it.  That is why a bond is never broken.  Being Keeper of Secrets has its advantages and disadvantages."  I glared at Aurora for messing up before, which reminded me we still needed to go through all those things.

Alec smiled, "So you want to dominate him."  

Valentine continued in her silky voice, "Through a telepathic link."

I nodded, "Playing Valence's own games against him.  If they are Chevalier then Valence will be dead too."  I paused, "So Ant I need you to take care of the girls if this fails.  Ryan I am sorry for your untimely demise, and Mia's.  And someone needs to tell Damian, I'm sorry."

Marie asked from the corner, "Does Tony know what you plan to do?"

I nodded, "Yes ma'am, he does.  He'll be with me.  I need his strength.  I can't be alone with Tristan again, or I might not make it through the process."  Marie nodded.

Alec and Valentine got up, "Lead the way."

"Tony took him to where we tortured Johnny."  I hoped this would go well.  I prayed to the unknown, that it would go well.  I gave everything to the earth and moon and sun and all things that this would go well.  But I couldn't doubt myself.  I had to do this.  And I had to do it right

We found ourselves in the little room.  Alec and Valentine made the room a sanctuary.  A place where no magic got in and nothing got out.   We hoped it would help protect everyone.

Tony stared at Tristan.  I put my arms around Tony and laid my head on his chest.  "It's best if he's sleeping.  I know you want answers."  

Tony turned around in my embrace and held me tightly too his chest.  "I feel like a complete fool."

I hugged him tight, "Me too."

Alec asked softly, "What do you need us to do?"

I pulled away from Tony so I could see them.  "I need you to touch me and open yourselves to me so I can take what I need."  They nodded and followed their instructions.  I looked up at Tony, "Just be you."  I smiled.  And I put my head on Tony and closed my eyes.  I took a deep breath and I used Valentine's power to cross the chasm between my consciousness and Tristan's.  I found it relatively easily.  I tied an anchor of sorts off so I could get back to myself when I was done.  I walled off Tristan from everyone else including myself, but I pulled my bonds through me, to Tristan.  I could feel Ryan, Mia and Tony inside of Tristan.  

Everything was working fine.  I could feel Tristan starting to wake up and resist me.  I had to work quickly.  I grabbed all the bonds and I pulled them into Tristan.  I pulled mine through me and I pulled Tristan's into his mind.  I could feel them stretching in my hands.  I could see them thinning.  There was not enough strength in the bonds, if they snapped we'd all die.  I gave them a little strength of my own and I gave one last sharp pull and they popped free.

I felt free.  I felt empty.  And then I felt nothing.

# Five Years Later

I took a deep breath when I woke up.  The air rushed into my lungs.  My throat was dry.  I tried to open my eyes, but there was little to be seen, even with vampire eyes.  I felt something pressing down on both of my arms and started to panic.  

I stared down at what pinned my arms.  Two sleeping girls slept on me, curled up against my body.  They stirred.  I pulled my arms from underneath them and then looked up at me with a smile.  It melted my heart seeing those beautiful smiles looking up at me.  

I heard "Mommy" but neither of their lips moved.  I smiled at them

"Yes.  Which one are you?"  I looked at the one who'd been a sleep on my right arm.  

She smiled at me and shrugged.  "Great", I said then I noticed a necklace hanging at their necks.  One was an M and the other a C.  Well wasn't that nice.

I pointed at the one on my right.  Her hair was jet black with beautiful blue eyes.  "You are Carissa."  And I pointed at her sister, her hair was much lighter but they had the same beautiful blue eyes.  "You are Morgan."

They beamed at me and nodded.  "How long have I been a sleep?"

They both shrugged.  "You don't say much do you?"  I smiled.

I heard, "We've never had to.   We just woke up."  I think it was from Carissa?

"Carissa?"

She nodded and smiled at me.  "Okay.  But you just woke up.  How old are you?"  They shrugged.  I was confused.  They were my children.  I could feel them, I knew it was the girls I'd held only moments ago.  But here they were looking about 5 years old.  

I climbed out of the bed we were in.  It was a hospital bed, and we were all stuck with IV needles, though the IVs looked to be empty for a while.  The room shook, dust fell from the ceiling.  

I started looking around the room.  There were no lights, no obvious exits.  On the wall opposite the bed hung clothes, my clothes it looked like and my weapons.  On the floor was a neat pile of little girl clothes.  

The girls sat on the bed holding each other's hand.  They were watching me while I figured things out.  I saw no visible door in the room, there must be a way out.  But first things first, "Girls can you get up and get dressed?"

Carissa and Morgan hopped off and got dressed.  I pulled the clothes off the peg on the wall and got dressed.  I watched as the girls picked out identical outfits with one exception.  Morgan put her hair up in a red headband and Carissa decided to leave hers hanging.  I smiled.  I was still confused, very confused.  I strapped on my sword, and noticed a second hung with it.  I strapped on both and pulled down the sheaths for the daggers, they'd fit on their little thighs.  I kneeled and put a sheath on the outer right thigh.  I pulled a dagger out and I put it against my forearm and cut.  "Sharp, be careful.  You might need them."  I checked the status of the swords and daggers and everything was well maintained.

I started searching for a latch or something that would trigger the door to open.  

Morgan tugged on my shirt and did something with her hands.  I got down to her level and she showed me again.  Carissa understood her sister and smiled at me and spoke in my mind again, "Magic."

I looked at Morgan.  "Good idea. You'll have to teach me your signs later."  Morgan shook her head.  I looked at Crrissa, "She wants to speak like you, but her throat hurts, so does mine."

I nodded, "Ah, mine too.  You can speak then?"

Carissa shrugged, "We will try."

"I don't have anything to drink except my blood.  Do you want to try to see if it helps?"

Both of the girls gave me that look that could only be said to be disgusting.  I smiled.  "Okay we'll find a way out first then find something to drink."

They nodded.  I spread on my magic and sure enough there was a ward on the door to keep us in and others out.  I pulled it down and there was distinct pop and a fizzle.  Something had gone off outside.  The room shook again and I pulled the girls under me until things were settled.

But it wasn't long before the room shook again.  We had to get out of here.  I pushed the hidden door open and on the other side lay darkness and rubble and pretty much the same thing that we were just leaving.  I knelt down to talk to the girls again.  "Can you feel Daddy?"

Carissa and Morgan nodded with a smile.  "Alright, which way?"  They both pointed to the north.  "Okay North it is.  Before we go.  I want to keep you near me, so I don't have to worry about you."  I grabbed the bed sheet and ripped it into long strips and started making slings and harness.  In a few moments I had large enough slings to fit the girls in.  "Carissa, hope up on the bed and climb on my back and put this over my neck."  She did so.  "Morgan, hold this and you will sit at my left side.  Leaving my right hand free to fight if we need to."

And we were ready.  I peeked around the corner of the room and saw nothing.  We crept through the halls of the rundown compound.  I didn't recognize anything.  And I was alone.  I could barely feel Ant or my sires.  They must be far away.  I missed having Ryan and Mia and Tony in my mind.  I knew Tony was alive, the girls felt him.  I was glad that he was alive and that my death would not be the end of them.  But I missed them.  

Both of the girls gave me a hug and it startled me out of my thoughts.  "Thanks girls." I had to focus on getting out of the building.  

I heard thunder that was not thunder - bombs.  Bombs were falling above us.  I cloaked the girls in shadow and crept down the hall.  No point in making them a target.  I kept trying to go north.  I we kept running into dead end of collapsed tunnels.

I didn't know the compound well enough and I didn't know where I was, much less what was safe or what time of day it was.  I only had one choice to make.  I had to keep moving slowly and try to find a way out.

The girls held hands and the other hand searched for something.  Carissa put her hand on my neck and I felt a nagging feeling.  Morgan put her hand on my bare arm and I felt Tony.  I smiled.  "Thank you."  I tried to find a safe spot, but everything looked dead.  "Morgan you look left and Crrissa you look right.  You pinch me really hard if there is anything coming.  I'm going to try something."  They nodded.

I closed my eyes and I felt across the girls to their connection to their father.  He was both of their father.  And that made my eyes snap shut and I smiled, that was another mystery for later, but they were both Tony's that made me elated and my happiness spread to the girls and I felt Tony start.  I tried to send calming sensations, he seemed to understand.  I tried to ask for time of day.  I sent pictures of the sky, sun and moon.  

He returned a moon and I smiled brightly.  I sent a walk sign or a don't walk sign.  And prayed he understood what I meant.  He sent me a blinking walk sign.  I sighed and then I opened my eyes.  "Girls we are going to travel through the shadows nearest to Daddy.  It might make you feel funny but hold on okay.  We'll be safe when we get there."  They nodded and wrapped their arms around all of us.  It was a giant bear hug.  And I stepped into the shadow and thought of only Tony.    

# Legends

I stepped out into the shadows in the place between worlds.  I froze.  "Girls, don't move."  We did not move. 

I saw shadows moving.  I heard a wolf howl, and other feline growls low on the earth.  Then I heard, "Hold",  Tony came out of the forest at a run.  He saw me and he stopped dead in his tracks, he was crying I could see his tears in the moonlight.

Carissa pinched me.  And I smiled I let the shadow's drop from the girls and Tony covered his mouth in disbelief.  He was still crying but they were happy tears.

Out of the hut came a woman who I remembered, she was older.  Thea was smiling at me as she touched the barrier and it fell.  I got far away from the circle and said, "Put it back up."  

She nodded, "Already doing so Cari.  By the goddess we thought you were all dead."

I looked at Tony and he was still crying.  I pulled the girls harnesses off of me and set them down.  Carissa ran to her father, and Tony picked her up and wrapped his arms around her.  

Thea smiled at me, "He's been a wreak since he got here."

Morgan grabbed my hand and pulled me towards Tony.  Tony picked her up and hugged her too.  I smiled and watched him bond with the girls.  "You know they are both your's right?"

He looked at me confused.  "That was the problem wasn't it.  They both had primeval DNA.  I don't have any."  

Tony tried to put it together.  I smiled, "Valence or Tristan made the whole thing up.  Tristan couldn't have been the father any more than I could bear a human child.  That night, Tristan didn't finish in any place he could get me pregnant."

Tony put the girls down and pulled me in close and he hugged us all.  We returned the hug.   

We held each other for several moments.  I pulled away, "Ryan?  Mia?"

Tony smiled, "Both are safe.  Ryan is Ant's Chevalier, and Mia is Damian's, neither could not be tied to a vampire.  They felt very alone.  It's been an adjustment for all of us."

He looked at me, "What did you do?"

I shrugged, "I couldn't let you guys die if I died."

He hugged me again.  "How are you?"

I sighed, "Alone.  It's strange.  But that's okay.  I'll be okay.  My hunger is not here either."

Eve stepped out of the shadows, "I can explain that one.  Your little ones here, they've been feeding you, I don't know what they are doing, but when the three of you are together, you feed each other, no blood needed, nothing just the circle of touch."

"How long have I been out of it?"  I motioned to the girls.

Tony sighed, "5 years, 2 months and 3 days."

Eve smiled, "We have a lot to discuss."

I looked over at Eve, "Can it wait until tomorrow.  I want to spend time with my family."

She smiled, "Sure, I didn't think you'd want to be left in the dark that long, it's the only reason I said anything."

I nodded, "I've been asleep for 5 years.  I missed Tony. I missed all of my family."  I wrapped my arms around the girls and Tony.  

We sat in a family hug as people came to use and expressed their happiness.  Ryan and Ant were happy in their pairing. 

Ryan confided in me, "It's not so hard as being with you.  There's no back flow of pain or anxiety."  

I smiled, "I'm happy for you.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you what I was planning."

He hugged me, "If you told me what you were doing I'd have stopped you.  I loved being your Chevalier."

I nodded, "But now you don't have to worry about killing yourself when you have to kill me."

He looked at me with sorrow, "Yeah.  But I hope that day never comes."

I smiled back at him, "Me either."

Ant hugged me, "It's good to have you back.  I've been trying to help Dad through this, but I don't have the experience."

"You called him Dad?"  It sounded strange coming from Ant.

He laughed, "We've bonded.  I won't call you Mom though if that's alright with you."

I smiled, "I gave you permission long ago to stop calling me Mom, you don't have to start again."  

He nodded, "We still need you, me and Ry.  We aren't leaving just because you don't hold him Chevalier.  We are all family regardless of our ties."

"I wouldn't expect you to go, if that wasn't what you wished. You know that.  You can come and go as you please."

He hugged me again, "Good glad that's settled.  We've got some teaching to do I'll see you later."

I nodded and the girls waved.  Ant smiled brightly at his sisters.  Tony nodded and we were left alone again for a few moments.

Thea sat down with us.  "I know you want to deal with all this later, but this you must know now."

Tony looked down, and Thea frowned, "He won't tell you.  But I will.  Tristan still lives."

"What?" I stood up in shock.

Thea pulled my hand to sit down beside her.  "Tony?"  He shook his head.  Thea continued, "When you broke the bonds of Chevalier, and you severed your tie to him.  He was distraught.  But Tristan survived.  He saved him for you to kill.  But more importantly to make Tony your Chevalier in the process."

Tony muttered softly, "I can't live without you."

I moved next to Tony and hugged him the best I could without getting in his lap.

Thea put her hand on mine, "But he's not the man you knew or the man you killed, he's an animal, a beast, there is nothing inside him.  Nothing!"  She looked at me, "May I?"

I raised an eye brown but nodded.  She placed her hand on my forehead and a smile grew across her face.  Whatever she was doing she was happy.  "Tristan is dead.  What is left is of you.  Your punishment was removed."

"Her what?"  Tony nearly snapped her head off he was so flustered.

Thea smiled, "Our legends of Il Cane della Morte speak of her punishment."

Tony sighed, "Wait there are legends of her in your culture."

I laughed, "What do you expect when I'm over 800 years old."

He tilted his head in the I see your point way he did.  It was endearing.  Thea continued, "My family back in the old world, found Il Cane in a sacred place, she was looking for understanding."

I interrupted, "I was searching for tomes lost to my people.  My sources lead me to Thea's people's burial site."

Thea smiled, "Understanding.  My grandmother of old read Il Cane from afar and saw great evil and great potential.  Which is why she tied the two of you together years later, but that's later."  She smiled, "I'm getting ahead of myself.  Il Cane already served the earth.  But she used her powers for evil.  So the earth punished her.  Or so the legend goes."  

"When Il Cane killed the village, it was her death sentence from earth. "  She looked at Tony, "A man of great love and understanding saved Il Cane.  He saw the potential in her and he nursed Il Cane back to health.   And Il Cane's deed from that day forward protected the earth.  It is why we bonded you together."

"Tristan holds the punishment."  She looked at me.  "The earth will receive your punishment in lieu of your death."  Thea looked up to the heaven and she closed her eyes, "And the heavens and the earth shall bind them together forever."

I watched Thea praying to her gods, when she finished I smiled, "And that means?"

"Thank you for waiting.  It means, that Chevalier can come from your punishment, but only because the earth is accepting the remnants of your punishment as a soul."

I nodded.  "When can we do it then?"

Thea smiled, "We have more coming who want Chevalier.  They are nearly here, we should wait."

I looked at Tony, "We can wait?"

He nodded.  Thea stood up and then took each of the girl's hands.  "Let's leave your Mommy and Daddy alone for a few moments.  We've some people who are dying to meet you two."

I nodded and they went easily with Thea.  

Tony stood up and I followed, he lead me into the forest where talked after I'd been woken up after 12 years.

# The Runt

We sat on the creek edge in silence.  The birds and the crickets chirped in harmony with the base of the bull frog crocks.  The creek still babbled in the silence.  I laid my head on his shoulder and held his hand with both of mine.  It was good to be near him.  This time it felt different waking up, than it had before.  Tony and I were in a real relationship this time.  We'd loved each other for almost all of our lives but the last five years were different.  I don't know how I would have handled this without him.  I whispered, "I'm sorry I wasn't here for you."

Tony wrapped his arm around me and pulled me close.  "It's not your fault."

I poked him in the ribs, "Besides I know you probably had a little tart to keep you company."  I smiled up at him, but when he glared at me he was a little angry until he saw me smiling at him. 

He rolled his eyes and laughed softly and pulled me closer.  "I did.  I wasn't looking for someone, she just came to me.  She tried to make me get over you."  He frowned and looked down, "I think it was just the sex I liked."

I smiled and wrapped my arms around him and hugged him, "Sex isn't about love for everyone."

He looked at me, "I know you think that.  I know you mean it when you say you don't care who I'm with.  But I care.  Sex is not just about sex for me."

"And with her it was just sex?"  I asked cautiously.

He nodded, "She needed me."  I waited for him to continue.  He looked down at me and smiled then looked away again with a blush, "She's a Therian.  She hadn't been with anyone like her, she was afraid of being with a man.  She hurt someone she loved.  And with me she could be herself."

"And they say I adapt to what people want."  I hugged him.  "Tony,"  I put my hand on cheek and got him to look at me, "don't be embarrassed by the choices you make when I'm not there.  Love her, Fuck her, make love to her, I don't care.  What we have is different.  You have my complete trust, not many people can say that."

He smiled, "I know.  And I want you back in here."  He pointed to his head.  "Please let me be your Chevalier again."  He pleaded with me.  "I know why you did it.  Thank you for caring, but it's not what I want.  I want you back."

"If that's what you want."  I smiled and unwound myself from him and sat facing him on his lap.  I wrapped my legs around his waist and he smiled at me.  I kissed him, "I'll be whatever you need me to be."

We kissed and the passion rose.  Tony laid back and pulled me with him.  I could feel things rising for both of us.  Out of nowhere a girl ran over top of us.  I quickly pulled my swords in the direction that she'd come from.  She raced around a tree, but when she saw my swords drawn in the opposite direction she took refuge behind me.  Tony was standing beside me with his gun drawn.  He'd changed to something with more distance and more modern.  I smiled at him but there was little time for much more than that as a pack of burly men raced at us.

A man on a lectica followed behind them carried by four even burlier men than the pack in front of us.  I hadn't seen a lectica in many hundreds of years.  But here one was in the middle of n where.  

A large booming voice came from the large man on the lectica.  "Hold."  He was talking to his people, they all held in their places, even those rushing at us."

The litter bearers put the lectica on the ground and one let the large man use him as a stepping stool.  How archaic were these people?

He walked towards me, I pointed one sword at him and held the other to the left Tony was on my right.  He laughed at me.  "Give me back the runt."

I looked down at the girl hiding behind me and then back to him.  He was closer.  "What has she done?"

He frowned and glared at me for not being obedient.  He didn't know me and for that I was thankful.  "She has stolen from my table.  I demand blood for the theft."

If that's all he wanted, I pulled my swords across each wrist and let the blood flow from them on to the already wet ground.  "You have blood."

He glared at me and at the ground and then turned his gaze upon me in fury.  He lifted his hand and the men started to advance on us.

I smiled and put the sword in my left hand away and then picked up the little girl.  She clung to me with all the remaining strength in her body and I felt her power.  She was Therian.  I reached out to the men circling us, waiting for the command to attack, with my power and I felt their distinct resonance back, they were all Therian.  

The fat man dropped his hand and the men ran at us with lightning quick speed.  I put the girl down and sheathed my other sword.  I raised my hands and the men stopped.  They heeded my powers.  I smiled at the fat man and he glared at me.  

He urged his men on, I could feel his power rising.  They stayed put.  I gave him a smirk.  I was taunting him to try more.  He took up the sword at his side and he charged at me.  I pulled the girl to the side and we danced away from him.  Tony picked up the girl and backed out of the circle of men.  He knew I wanted this fight.  My body ached for a decent fight, though I didn't think this one would be all the challenging.  

With my left hand I taunted him to come again.  You could see the anger getting the better of him as his face reddened.  He attacked me and I parried easily.  We danced for a few moments and he dropped to his knees out of breathe.  He truly was a fat man.  I felt his power rise and he started to change.  

I smiled, nothing could be worse for him.  His bones cracked and snapped, he howled in pain.  The men around him started to change.  In seconds I was surrounded by wolves.  The girl was clawing at Tony, she was fighting the call to change.  I closed my eyes and I tried to calm her.   I was strong in three things, Animal Ken was my third strongest power.  She yielded her fight and she gave herself to me.  She held her human form.  

The men before me had fully changed and were trying to fight my control.  They took a step closer.  When I turned my attention back at them I pushed them back.  They cowered before me.

I tired of this game.  I feed more strength into my control of the men.  More power than I had ever fed into a Therian.  I fed them my power and I commanded them all to shift.  They screamed in pain but they shifted back to their human form.  

They all lay on the ground shaking in pain.  I knelt down to the fat man.  "Do you wish to fight me more?"

From the town Thea came running at full speed.  She stopped dead in her tracks.  Her chest rose and fell from the run.  She took a deep breathe, "What is going on?"

"These men attacked me."  I stated.

The men were all cowering on the ground.  Thea looked at me.  "Why?"

"They would not take my offering of blood for the girl's theft."  I nodded to the girl in Tony's arm.

Thea knelt down to the man, "Is this true, did she offer the girls penance freely and you refused?"

He stammered.  Thea looked up at me, then at the little girl.  She smiled fondly at the girl, the little girl hid her face in Tony's shoulder.  Thea nodded, "Your own child steals from you and you hunt her down?  Then you are offered blood and you refuse, what is it with you Wolf King?"

He stood up, naked but as royal as ever.  I rolled my eyes.  "What... what... is she?"

Thea smiled, "This is Il Cane.  You have offended her."

He turned to me with fear in his eyes.  I could feel it wafting off of him.  "The Vampire Queen."

"I am no Queen"

He knelt to me and the rest of the men followed suit.  

Thea smiled, "Here my friend, you are Queen, and have been for centuries.  We should probably say god, but we believe in no god."

"They worship me?"  What an odd thought.

Thea nodded, "It is you who keep their lands safe from man from vampire.  In protecting us, you have protected them for centuries."

I nodded.  "So what should I do with this?  I will not give them this child."

The King groveled before me, "Take her, she is a gift."

"Be gone.  I tire of your games."  I walked away from them.  I really didn't want to be anywhere near where that fat man could worship me.

Tony fell in step behind me carrying the girl.  Thea caught up and smiled at me.  She whispered, "I've never seen anyone cower the Wolf King.  I felt the power you used, I was already half way here.  Everyone is here.  They are ready for the ceremony."  I nodded.

# The Sky Is Falling

Tony was whispering with the little girl.  I smiled he was very good with children.  As we reached the town our girls raced towards us.  First wrapping themselves around their father, and then clung to me.  I lifted then with ease.  The girl Tony held eyed them.  I stopped and Tony stopped and we brought the girls together.  

I smiled at the little one in Tony's arms, "This is Carissa."  I shifted her on my hip.  And then tossed Morgan, "And this is Morgan."  They smiled brightly at the new arrival.

Tony smiled, "This is Leyla."

I set Carissa and Morgan down, "Would the two of you like to show Leyla around?"  They nodded and Morgan held a hand out to Leyla.  The three girls scampered off to get into something.  As long as they were happy it didn't matter right now.

Thea smiled, "I think she will fit in well with your girls.  But be careful, Cari, she's more like you than you know."

I nodded, "I can feel the scars."  Thea nodded with a smile.  I added, "Shall we?"

Tony took my hand and we made our way into the long building.  The symbols were drawn and Tristan sat in the circle waiting.  He glared at us through the veil of hatred.  I smiled.  I would enjoy this.

There were some men and woman that I didn't know.  I didn't matter.  "All lesser Chevalier made?"  They all nodded.

I turned to Tony and offered him my wrist.  And he offered me his.  We both bit and muttered the words that came with making lesser Chevalier.   I could see Aurora and Francesco watching from entangled arms.  They smiled like happy parents.  I smiled.

"Vampires."  They all touched me and left the building.  They didn't need to stay.  Tony touched me and I nodded.  I said the words.  "Humans."  And then the humans gave their souls to Tristan.  He would take them to hell.  Once again, we swore our souls to the eternal fires of hell, if you believed in such things.   They all left.  I looked around and Tony was the only one left in the room.  I turned to the man before us.  He was wild.  There was nothing human left in him.  I blessed his soul to the earth and I chopped of his head in one swift motion.  His husk of body fell forward and the blood spurted from the wound.  

I felt the magic working.  I felt Tony's bond solidify in my mind.  I watched as he closed his eyes.  I felt him relax through the newly formed bond.  He was home again.  And I didn't realize how lonely it had been before.

The ground shook and we heard screaming from outside.  Another thunder clap and one wall of the building fell in.  Tony grabbed my hand and we stepped into the shadows where the girls were.  All around there was screaming.  We each grabbed a girl, Tony took Leyla in his arms, and I grabbed a little boy who had been with the girls.  

Before we could move Ant and Ryan were next to us.  Ant was breathless, "Bombs, missiles of some sort from the south."

Thea was standing in the doorway to the house we were in, a bomb landed just outside the door and I saw her body explode from the sound wave alone.  I yelled, "Move" And we moved as a unit.  We all stepped into the shadows and leapt someplace safe.  We landed on the teetering edge of a cliff.  I looked out over the cliff and saw the ocean and all its peaceful bliss.  I looked at Carissa and Morgan.  "Find cover.  Take the other children with you.  Keep them safe."

They drew their little daggers as if they knew what to do and they led the children down the cliff.  

I looked at the men with me, "Where can we get to that is behind them?"

Ant nodded, "I know a place."  We wasted no time.  We stepped into the Shadows.

In front of us we saw a tank and men in military armaments.   I recognized the man on the tank bellowing orders.  I anger rose and Tony grabbed my arm.  "We'll draw their attention, you sure you want to do this?"

I nodded.  I wanted to kill Salvador Einor myself.  I wanted to see the fear in his eyes when I brought my sword to bear on his neck.

Tony, Ant and Ryan all went one direction.  I waited for them to draw some of the attention.  

I walked through a line of men with guns and sliced them through with my swords.  The blood raining down felt glorious.  I wanted to do more, but I had eyes for only one thing.  Men turned and starting shoot me.  Thankfully none were silver and I continued to my target unhindered by the bullets.  I sliced through the final line of me and jumped on to the powerful tank.  Sal has watched my progress he never showed an ounce of fear.  When I was in reach he placed his hand on me as he had done so many times before.  

I smiled at him and he tried to cow me with his power.  I drank in the power and Sal's eyes widened.  He'd forgotten the first lesson he'd taught me.  I pulled his power into me.  He fell to his knees.  I held my sword high above his head.  He nodded and mouthed, "I'm sorry."  And I brought the sword down and his head rolled.  I held up my hand his body started to burn. 

The smell of burning flesh made my stomach turn and I hopped down from the tank with Sal's head still in my hand.  

The army of men stood and stared at me.  My body was riddled with bullet holes that were slowly healing, I could feel them oozing blood.  I threw Sal's head to the ground and yelled, "Anyone else?  Be gone with your lives or I shall kill you and send your heads to your so called leaders in a box."

The men dropped their weapons and ran.  We watched them run.  From the forest the wolves ran after the fleeing me.  I smiled and turned my attentions back to the town.  There was little activity.  We searched the rubble for survivors but we found none.  We did not see any of the council, or any of the other humans.  There were no bodies save a few pieces.  

I saw an arm from under the rubble.  I uncovered it only to find it had been severed.  I sighed.  This was a great loss.

Tony touched my arm, "I can feel my father and Henry."

I closed my eyes.  "I feel Aurora.  Alec and Valentine are far away."

Dimitri smiled, "I sent the wolves after the remainder of the men.  I doubt few will survive.  The Fat Wolf King was gracious to heed the call of Il Cane."

I smiled it had been a good encounter it had seemed.  I didn't feel Damian.

"No",  Ryan cried out in pain.

We all ran to him.  He held Mia in his arms.  I closed my eyes and fell to my knees.  A could feel a tear sliding down my cheek, and then another.  Damian was dead if Mia was dead.

Ant put his hands on Ryan and I wrapped my arm around him, Dimitri put his hand on Tony.  Tony touched my arm and we stepped into the shadows to the children.  We could do nothing more here.  We would bury Mia we couldn't stay if they returned.

I called to Aurora.  If she could feel me she'd come when she could.

Behind us there was a rustle and Francesco, Aurora, Henry, Alec and Valentine stepped out of the shadows.  They sighed with relief, but all stopped short when they saw Ryan crying over Mia's body.

Aurora frowned, "Where are the girls?"

I smiled, "Safe, they are finding shelter."

I put my arm around Ryan, "She'll like being buried here.  She can overlook the water."

Ryan looked up and blinked the tears away.  He turned to me with fury.  He punched me in the chest.  I took a step back.  He threw another punch that landed in my chest.  I continued to step backwards while he hit me.  Ryan yelled at me, "If you'd kept the bond she'd be safe."  He drew his gun.  It had silver bullets.

Everything happened so fast.  The gun went off and I stepped backwards, my foot slipped and I fell over the cliff.  I heard screams as they raced to the edge with care.  I closed my eyes.  One hell of a way to die.

I fell and I felt at peace with it all.  Ryan had done what he'd said, even if he hadn't meant to do it right now.  I knew the ground had to be near.  I braced for impact.

I was surprised to find that when I hit I sank into the rocks below.  I heard stunned shouts from above.  I opened my eyes and saw standing above me my daughter.  Morgan smiled brightly at me as she reached for my hand.  Crrissa was holding the other children back.  When I grabbed her hand I felt her power flowing into the earth.  When I was clear of the ground I hugged the child tightly.   "Thank you Morgan."

She smiled at me and I opened my arms to the rest of the children and the came to me and I held them all.  The little boy cried in my arms, the girls held on to me and each other.  

A few moments later the rest of them were down on the ground stepping out of the shadows of the cave in the cliff.  Ryan stayed at the entrance sobbing.  Tony was relieved and he hugged me tightly.  "What the hell happened?"

I smiled, "Our lovely little daughter here."  I tapped Morgan on the back and she squeezed tighter, "softened the earth."  He wrapped his arms around me and the children.

He lifted the little boys head.  "Oh my god."  He turned and called, "Ryan"

Ryan walked over to us and stood above us.  He looked down and stared at the little boy.  He wept.  I looked up at Tony, he neither smiled nor frowned, I didn't know what to make of his expression.  "This is Lee.  Mia and Damian's adopted son."

I hugged the little boy tighter.  "Ryan, what do you want to do?"

He looked at me helpless.  "I'm not a father.  I don't want to be a father."  He looked at me pleading, "Will you care for him?"

I smiled and stood up, the children let go and held on to each other.  I hugged Ryan, "I will as if he were my own."  He hugged me.

He pushed me away from him and looked at me like he was inspecting me.  "I shot you."

"The bullet never hit as far as I can tell."

He laughed, "So I can't even kill you with a gun."

Tony smiled, "You can't even kill her if you push her off a cliff."  Everyone laughed.  I smiled and hugged my friend.  Ryan hugged me tightly, I returned it, that was the most apology either one of us was going to give.  But we both accepted it.  We'd been through a lot.  

Ryan whispered in my ear, "You think she'll really like it here."

I nodded, "Yeah I do.  The sky here is beautiful at night and the sunsets are beyond anything you've ever seen."  I cried softly into his shoulder.  I would miss my friend very much.

# A Stick Of Binding

Ryan and Ant took turns digging a hole on top of the cliff over looking the sea, while Tony and I went to find Damian's body.  We all thought it was best to bury Mia and Damian together if we could.  We hoped there would be something left to bury.  Mia was hardly damaged so we didn't have much hope for finding Damian.  We didn't have long to find him.  The sun would rise and whatever was left would burn, and I would burn with it if I wasn't under shelter.

Tony and I stepped into the shadows outside of the ruins that many of our friends died.  There were no sounds.  War had come to the once peaceful place, the birds and the animals were hiding and they might never return.  

Charred earth and the smell of death was not the only thing that welcomed us when we stepped into town.  Pillagers and looters were already going through the rubble.  These were people who I did not know and Tony's scowl indicated that they were not men and women he knew either.

Out of the rubble stepped the fat king with a gluttonous look on his face.  He looked proud of what he was doing until he saw me and ran the other way.  It was pure habit.  I reached for one of my daggers, which were not on my arms.  I sighed and threw up a line of fire in front of the fat man.  He skid to a stop and turned to look at me with frightened eyes.  He prickled with power, he was afraid of me and I smiled at him.

He watched me as I walked to him.  "Why are you running, Fat King?"

He sneered at me, "I thought.  You mean.., "He looked relieved, "I was looking for survivors."

Tony stepped forward, "I can smell a lie, and you stick of one."  

The fat man cowered before Tony and Tony smiled, I asked, "What did you do that makes you so guilty?"

A man in the shadows stepped out.  He smiled widely at me, "He brought the men to you.  He killed your friends.  Dimitri didn't tell you his folly."  He nodded towards the fat man.

I shook my head, "Dimitri knew?"  

"It is why Dimitri sent us after the men.  To undo what he'd done."  He smiled.  "Dimitri left me in charge but I did not know until a few hours ago we'd lost the king.  Thank you for finding him."

Tony looked at the new man, "You are?"

He smiled, "I'm Michael West, David's father, you do remember my son."

We both nodded, but I looked back at the fat man and I stalked towards him.  He cowered on the crown before the fire.  I got down on my hands and knees and crawled towards him.  "You killed my friend."

Tony reached me before I reached the man, "Cari.  Let him be to his laws."

I growled at the man before me.  I wanted to kill him he was responsible for Mia's death.

Michael smiled, "She can kill him.  It would save me the trouble.  He has already been sentenced by the Beast King.   Not all packs will follow the Beast King's orders, but ours does.  He is a good man."

I looked up at Michael and nodded.  Dimitri was a good man.

"We are looking for Damian.  He is dead, we are burying his wife, we'd like to bury them together.  Have you seen him?"  I tried not to look at the man before me.  I closed my eyes and fought the urge to rip out his throat and bathe in his blood.  It was not what Mia would have wanted.

Michael didn't answer, but more men and women and children came from the forest behind him.  "We will help you find who you are looking for and bury the rest."

I nodded.  He smiled at me, "You can kill the Fat King.  I would very much be honored to have Il Cane do my duty."

Tony smiled and pulled me to my feet.  "Michael West, do you wish to hire the services of Il Cane?"  

Michael looked a bit confused and then it seemed to dawn on his face, "Ah.  Yes, Il Cane, I give you..."He looked around and picked up a stick, "I give you this fine artifact of my people, for the life of the Fat King."

Tony smiled at me.  I looked at Michael; he smiled brightly at me as well.  "I nodded.  It would be my honor to serve you."  And without a second thought about it I cleared my mind of everything but the man in front of me.  But I would honor Mia's death not in blood but severity of punishment.  I drew my sword and I brought it down on top of the cowering fat man.  The strength of the blow slit the man in two symmetrical halves.   As the blade finished its last bit of flash the body burnt.  It was a practiced move and the smell of burning flesh made me gag.  I closed my eyes and fought the need to purge my stomach of nothingness.  I stood and I watched the man's corpse burn.

I don't know how long I stood there watching the fires of my wrath.  Tony touched my arm and I turned to look at him.  He whispered, "They've found Damian's head, the rest they can't tell for sure."

I nodded then turned back to the flames.  They were no longer burning the man I'd killed, they'd long since feed upon the remains, only my wrath was left and I let the flames burn hot and bright.

Tony wrapped his arms around me from behind.  He leaned to my ear and whispered, "Come, it will be light and we need to bury them before then."

Michael handed me a stick with a smile, and he handed Tony a box with what I assumed was what was left of Damian.  I felt a tear slide down my cheek.  "We follow you Il Cane.  You call and we will come.  You have saved us in more ways than we can count and we only wish we could repay you that kindness."

I nodded.  Tony wrapped his arms around me and he stepped us through the Shadows to the top of the cliff.

# The House By The Sea

We arrived at the top of the cliff and the sun was starting to peak its hot head above the horizon.  I stepped into the shadows alone, into the cave the girls had found.  It would be hard to hide from the sunlight, but we had to try.  Only three of us left could manage the sunlight.  Valentine and Alec slept in the dark corner of the cave. Tt really was just an inlet in the mountain carved from the sea on high tide.  Hopefully high tide was not near.  Aurora was hugging Francesco. He was going to help Ryan as Ant was fleeing into the cave with me.  We'd waited too long.

Ant hugged me, "The time difference caught us I think."  I nodded.  "Francesco, Tony and Ryan will bury Mia and Damian and we'll say words tonight, if that will do for you."  I nodded again.  I was tired and hungry.  

I curled up in the other dark corner and the girls came to me.  The other children followed.  Lee and Leyla came and curled up next to me.  Ant sat down next to me.  I smiled, he whispered, "One big happy family with Momma."  I rolled my eyes at him.  He laughed softly, "But it's true."

He was right, this felt right.  It was a family.  Not something I thought I'd ever have, but here it was, in the worst of times.  I closed my eyes and felt Tony working to cover our friends.  Our rag-tag family was as together and that was what mattered.  

A shadow from the coming sun made me open my eyes.  A shadowed figure stood in the doorway, peering into the darkness.  Ant put his hand on mine. He didn't want me to make any moves.  The figure spoke loudly into the darkness.  "I've seen the shadows move before." It was a much older man; his voice was ragged with age.

I hadn't heard the saying in many years, but the reply was automatic, "The sun moves and they follow." 

There was an audible sigh of relief from the man.  "My Isabel would have loved to see you again."

I smiled, "William?"

His shadowed figure nodded.  "When the sun sets you and yours are welcome in our house."

Tony, Ryan and Francesco stood behind the old man, Tony and Francesco drew weapons and I didn't have time to say anything before Ryan stepped between the man and their weapons.  Ryan spoke calmly to the other men, "This is William, husband of Isabel, one of Cari's Lesser Chevalier over the years.  He is a friend."  Ryan hugged the man.  "Is Isabel well?"

The sorrow in William's voice was loud, "She passed two years ago."  

Ryan hugged him again.  "I am sorry for you loss.  I hope you don't mind, but we buried my sister and her husband upon your cliff so they could see the night sky and your beautiful sunsets."

It was William's turn to express his sorry for our loss.  "I'm sorry, I know she will be greatly missed."

I spoke from the shadows, "When night comes will honor your wife and our friend."

He nodded, "I look forward to it.  I will prepare a feast."  He laughed, "Well what comes as a feast these days."

Ryan hugged him again, and William left.  The three men came into the cave and stood guard while the rest of us slept.

I heard them discussing William and Isabel as I drifted to sleep.

I woke when the sun was high in the sky.  I hadn't slept long.  Ryan was sleeping.  Francesco was standing at the entrance.  I did not know where Tony was, but I could feel him safe.  I started to move the children from my body they were using as a pillow.  Francesco turned to see me moving he was in the process of drawing his gun.  I still thought it was funny that the primeval vampires, particularly someone as old as he was using a gun.   He relaxed visibly and came to help me with the children.  

He whispered to me, "You are up early." 

I nodded, "I'm hungry, I won't sleep well until I can eat well."

He nodded, "Tony is hunting."

"What is he hunting?"

Francesco smiled, "Deer I'd assume, orr some other animal.  Most of us can be sustained with traditional means.  The rest of you we'll figure something out.  We don't have many humans here for you lot."

I nodded, "And what we do are too young except for Ryan and he can't feed us all."

Francesco nodded.  "But you drink from other things yes?"

I nodded, "Dimitri will prefer to feed up on the animals as well."

He smiled, "I'd forgotten that part. It wasn't what I meant."

I cocked my head at him in confusion.  He laughed, "Don't act like you don't know what I mean."

"You mean I feed off of your son, literally?"

He nodded, "I don't know why he lets you.  Aurora refuses."

I shrugged, "We've done it for centuries when we have been together."

He nodded, "I know.  And I still find it disturbing that you are not addicted to vampire blood like a human."

"It's our connections I'm sure, but Thea is no longer with us to confirm it."  I looked down.

Francesco put his arm around me.  "We've lost many.  And we will lose more in this war.  But we will win.  They will not have died for nothing."

I leaned in to him and hoped he was right.

Tony returned as the sun was beginning to set.  It was hard staying in the shadows on the west facing caving with the sun setting but there was room for most of us to hide with the help of our less fragile friends.  

The sun had finally set and only a few minor burns were had.  We'd made it through to night.  We were together, and together we moved to through the shadows to the grave site.

Ryan knelt beside the mound of dirt with his nephew in his arms.  "We love you Mia.  Damian.  You will be missed."

I tried not to cry.  It didn't manage well.  I had only one tribute to give to my fallen friends.  I stuck the sacred artifact that the new Wolf King had given me as a token of reward.  Tony laughed.  I slit my wrist and let the blood drain onto the grave.  "My promise to avenge your deaths until my last breath."

We stood in silence.  We stood there several minutes before Ryan had to ask, "What's with the stick?"

Tony laughed again.  "It was her reward for killing the Fat King."  

Ryan laughed.  "She accepted a stick?"

Tony smiled, "She was going to kill him anyway this made it legal by the laws of those who hired her."

Ryan smiled and looked up at me, "And you are giving Mia and Damian your reward.  She would love it."

I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes.  I smiled, I couldn't speak.

Tony took my hand and the girls clung to my legs as we all stood there for a few moments.  Tony stepped away pulling me and the girls with him, "We've a feast to get to."

The house by the sea was small, but it was busy with people.  I blinked in surprise.  I hadn't expected anyone other than William.  A few children saw us coming and yelled, "They are coming", And they ran into the house.  People began to come out of the forest behind the house, torches flickering in the distance.  I stopped.

Tony asked, "What's wrong?"

"I don't know."

William came out of the house helped by the two children who had run inside.   We stayed where I stopped as William came to us.  I could see his big smile even from the distance.  The boys were making sure he did not fall in the sand.  I'd bet anything they were his grandchildren.  I was happy he and Isabel had a good life.

He bowed deeply in front of me.  "I told you, we'd have a feast.  You must be hungry.  Even here by the seashore we've heard of your deeds.  Everyone here wishes to help you in some way.  Whatever way we can."

He looked at me, "I know you won't take more than you need.  But we offer what we have to you and yours.  It's the least we can do."

I was still not sure what was going on.  He smiled, "You've not heard.  General Dilanti has declared you an enemy of the state.

He claims you've killed two of his generals and eternal life is the reward for your death."  He waved his hand at the crowd gathering behind him, "We don't want eternal life of servitude.  There are many other colonies all over that would give you shelter and help.  You only need but to ask."

As if William had commanded the crowd moved towards us, some kneeling most offering a wrist to us.  They were all smiling.

I stepped forward, "I will accept all that offer, but first my friends and the children must be feed.  The children eat real food."

William waved the boys helping him forward.  "Show them to the dinner table."  He looked at Ryan, "I'm sure you are hungry too."

Ryan nodded and picked up Lee and took Leyla's hand.  The five of them walked towards the house, followed by half the women.

Francesco, Aurora, Valentine, Alec fed until they were full and followed their new friends into the house by the sea.  William frowned, "And you kind sir."

I smiled at him, "Tony won't feed until I do.  That's what husbands do, they look out for you."

William laughed and hugged Tony, "So glad to meet the man who could handle this one."  He offered his wrist to Tony.  Tony had no choice but to feed on the frail man.

"I will take what's offered in an orderly fashion."  They lined up, like they'd done this before.  I had only done this once before.  A village was threatened by a rogue vampire and they paid tribute to me this way.  They knew of vampires and some lived among them and showed them the way.  They were thankful I'd helped them.  I didn't know why these people wanted to thank me.  But I wouldn't hurt their feelings.

I drank a small amount from each of them.  I played no favorites.  Tony took a few and got his fill.  He was hungrier than he acted.  By the time the line had dwindled to nothing I was full.  There were many people in this little conclave that were thankful.  A small woman stood in the distance.  When the last was feed upon she came to me, "My father is inside telling tales of Il Cane to the children."

I smiled, "Nothing too scary I hope."

She shook her head, "No.  He only has fond memories of you and yours.  He loved my mother and he loved that she waited for nearly a century to find him."  I smiled.  She took my hand.  "Come, stay with us for the night.  Surely you can spare a moment of time."

"I think we can spare more, but I don't want to risk you all.  They will come for me, for us."  I didn't want to hurt my people.

"Stay for as long as you feel comfortable."  

I bowed to her, "Thank you."

# The Conclave

Tony and I walked with William's daughter to the house by the sea.  It was just a little thing, barely big enough for the old man himself, but it seemed to house more souls than humanly possible.  Everyone waved as we walked by all with great big smiles.  They were happy to see us, even though we had never met them in our lives.  She led us to a small room inside the house, it was covered in maps and various other things that indicated to me that they were tracking something or planning it, I wasn't sure which.

A group of young men stood around the table with a spread out map of the entire USA.  I didn't know any of them but when they looked up and saw us their smiles were brighter than the candles in the room.  I heard footsteps behind me, Ryan draped his arms around me and Tony.  "There you two are.  These men have something to show us."  He wiggled between the two of us.  He held out his hand to the men in front of him, "I'm Ryan Elliott, this is Cari and Tony Giovanni."  He giggled, "No relation, well..."

"That's enough Ryan."  He liked being silly at the worst of times.  He gave me a mock frown and puppy dog eyes.  I sighed and smacked him on the shoulder, "Behave."  He laughed.

The men made their introductions - Steve, Riley and Scott were the names of the other three men.  They claimed to be former military, before the New Order had taken over.  They drew Tony over to the table, I don't think they counted me as a military mind, but that was fine with me I'd watch and listen and learn.  I was use to the feeling.  Ryan looked up at me to make sure I took no offense.  He smiled and nodded.  He knew me far better than anyone else did. 

Steve spoke quietly, as if he were trying to hid his words from me, but I guess he forgot I was vampire.  "This is where we are."  He placed a little green army man toy on the map.  He placed several more in California and along the west coast.  "These are conclaves that support what remains of your CHSB."  He placed some blue army men in various places moving east into the mountains.  "I believe these are Therian camps that are loyal to the Beast King."  He took what looked to be some dice and placed them in the plains.  "These are camps that we think are loyal to the CHSB or some factions of the old vampire world."  He looked up at me and smiled, "Il Cane still has many who fear her.  And I'd bet my next meal to say that these camps would follow her if she were to show up."

Steve was still smiling at me so I spoke up, "So you believe, that if we show up on their door steps, friend or possible friend we've have more allies?"

He nodded, "And here I thought you let others do the thinking."

Tony laughed, "Seriously you don't know her very well.  She probably is one step ahead of you in terms of what she wants to know."

Steve smiled, "If that's the case, what is it Il Cane wants to know?"

"Where is Valence?  And what are the most influential targets along the way there."  It was simple.  Make a swath through their territory and take out Valence.  He was the worst of the enemies at hand.  Brandon might be the head, but Valence was the teeth and claws.  He had to go first.

Steve turned back to his map and put down a plastic gold coin.  "Valence is here."  He thought about what lie between and smiled.  He placed two silver coins between us and the golden one.  "Here are two canneries, the human livestock processing plants.  We believe Valence is also at a cannery."

I watched as Tony looked at the map.  He was formulating a plan.  I smiled, "We need as much intell on those three places we can get our hands on.  Tony will make plans with you.  He seems to be deep in thought." 

Tony looked up at me with a smile, "You are going to follow my plan?"  I nodded, "I'll believe it when I see it."

I smiled at him, "I'm not going to rush in alone to three places I know nothing about."

He nodded, "Which is why you want me to have the intel first.  So you aren't tempted."

It was my turn to nod, "So I'm not tempted.  I have two children to train.  They aren't staying here."

Ryan looked up, "And the other two?"

"They will learn weapons, and what I can show them of their powers, but I am not Therian, we will need to find a Therian teacher for them."  

He nodded.  "I'll find one."  

One of the other men, I think it was Riley, "You are going to take children with you?"  He looked appalled.

"These children can survive more than you can.  With the proper training and instruction and a good mentor, they can be better at fighting than you are."

He looked about ready to bit my head off.  "You think these children are a better fighter than me?"

"Not right now they aren't, they lack training, they lack skill.  But they are stronger and faster than you are, in my book that will make them better than any human can be."

He looked at Ryan, "Do you see what she thinks of your skill?"

Ryan laughed, "Sir, she means no offense, she's just stating the facts.  And I am over 700 years old.  I am stronger and faster and I was trained by Il Cane for almost my entire life.  I am no mere human.  I am Chevalier."

He looked like he was going to blow a fuse.  You could almost see the light bulb go off in his head, "So train us."

I smiled, "I will train the children.  If others wish to watch and do and follow as the children do, you are welcome.  But I will not treat them as more than children.  It is best to learn when you are young."

Ryan laughed, "And when she says that she means it.  It was more than a hundred years after I started training that I finally was treated like an adult when it came to weaponry.  But she will train you to be the best."

Riley and the others looked at me with what I could only classify as hatred.  I didn't care, I would do as I always did and they could do what they did.  I turned without saying another word and left the men to do their work.  Even my own thoughts were sarcastic on that feeling.  For being such a progressive time, it was no better than the world I grew up in.

I found the children sitting around the table still eating.  I sat down with then and one of the women offered me a glass of something.  I shook my head and she took it away.  She never even told me what it was or forced me to try it.  This conclave seemed to very use to catering to vampires.  I wondered what they had done prior to this war.

I noticed the children were all looking at each other.  I closed my eyes and listened as they ate in what appeared to be in silence.  I could feel a very lit touch and knew what was going on.  Carissa was linked to the children and they were talking amongst the strangers.  They weren't being rude but they weren't being social either.  They would have to learn to communicate normally, but that was for a later time.  Carissa felt me on the edge of their circle.  She smiled at me as she included me in their conversation.

Morgan thought at the group, "These are good.  We should hide a few for later."

I smiled and put my hand on Morgan's outreached hand and spoke out loud, "No Morgan, there will be plenty for later.  We don't need to hoard food."

She frowned softly.  I put a finger under her chin and lifted her eyes.  "I'm sure they are wonderful, why don't you thank the ladies for their efforts."

Morgan smiled and nodded.  But she didn't know how to communicate her thanks.  Leyla smiled, "Ma'am.  We want to thank you for these cookies.  They are wonderful."  The women beamed with pride.

One turned to me, "You can understand them?"

I nodded, "It's not so much as understanding as being included.  My own powers are very weak in that field of vampiric powers.  I can prevent it from happening to me and feel when someone else is but beyond that I'm as out of it as you are."

She smiled with happiness.  "Maybe we can help them communicate with the rest of us.  We understand from Mister Elliott that they slept for five years so didn't get to be toddlers and explore."

I nodded.  "Unfortunately but thankfully Carissa can speak with her mind and Morgan is gaining skill in Empathy.  They are learning, but yes, if you'd like to help them speak I would be grateful."

She bounced away to tell the others what I'd said.  I was happy to let them help. 

I turned my attention to the four children, "Now let's go outside, we've some other learning to do."

# The Basics

The children followed me into the darkness.  I felt their eagerness through their mental connection.  I was glad to be included, but I was grateful it wasn't all the time.  That many children running around in my mind would probably drive me crazy.  

We went out to the beach the sand would provide good resistance to their movements and help with their balance.  Balance and strength were key in using a weapon, even if it was a gun.  Though I'd never done much with a gun I knew I could fire one in a pinch, I don't think I could hit the target without much luck, but I could do it and at least startle the opponent.  The children would not be using guns, for now they'd be using sticks.

I stopped and turned to the four children and smiled, their first instruction.  "Find a straight stick about the length of your arm about as thick as your thumb."  They ran off into the direction of the forest.

I turned back to the ocean and sat on the damp sand.  I stared out over the waves and listened to the waves softly crash on the sand.  The stars were out in plenty and they looked like diamonds in the heavens.  Mia would have liked it here.  I laid back on the sand and thought of my friend.  Thought of the day we'd met, of the scared little girl we'd found tied to a stake left for the wolves or worst to devour.  We had all grown since those days.  I was going to miss Mia.  

I don't know how long I laid on the sand staring at the sky, but the children returned with their sticks.  They stood above me in a circle, ready to begin.  I sat up and when I turned around I saw that four had turned into about ten children all wielding sticks.

I smiled.  I pulled a sword from my sheath and showed the children how to hold their sticks.   "Hold your sticks like this.  About two finger widths from the bottom."  I helped a few of the younger children get it right.  

"Space out."  I instructed, "Hold your arms out like this."  I held my arms straight out from my sides, my sword extended to the right.  "Your fingers should touch the stick tip of the one next to you."  They scooted and stood as instructed.  I dropped my arms and they followed suit.  

I turned my back to them and I showed them where their stick would rest on their hip.  I assumed they followed me.  I unsheathed my sword and held my sword in a guard stance, ready for everything but relaxed.  I made a few basic moves, concentrating mostly on foot work.  I repeated several times, "Continue while I watch."

I turned around and saw the children following my motions.  Some were falling over their own feet, others were hitting their neighbors, but what I noticed most of all that we were gathering an audience of adults.  Some of the seasoned military men were watching, the women were frowning at the children playing at being swordsmen.  I saw Ryan and Ant stepping between the children helping the ones having the most trouble.  I smiled at them when the saw me watching.  Their smiles were wide. They enjoyed teaching, particularly children.

I stepped aside and Ant stepped in front of the children.  In a loud clear voice he gave them more instructions.  I showed them what he meant with my own sword.  He smiled at me.  He shouted out the names of movements and forms and I performed them.  The children followed me.  It was a good team effort.  Ant was good with the children.

Ryan was helping the children.  They really did make a great team.  When the movements were starting to repeat I turned to watch.  The crowd had grown even more. 

We taught well into the night.  The sky was starting to lighten and we wrapped things up.  The children clung to their sticks like they were real weapons.  I wished I could give them real swords, but the time and effort to do so was not there.  

Riley, Michael, and Scott walked with us back to the house.  Riley stopped in front of the door barring our way, He cleared his throat, "I'm sorry.  I see the merit of your teachings.  But I don't see how a stick will help."

I laughed, "A stick can be a good weapon as a sword if you know how to use it.  Now if you don't mind I'd like to get inside before we start igniting."

Riley frowned at me but he didn't move.  Ryan picked up the military man with ease and moved him out of the way, "Sorry dude, but my family is about to be crispy, get out of the way."

I smiled and walked into the house and away from any windows, Ant followed, the girls and Lee and Leyla where already curled up in blankets.  Carissa and Morgan were covering their entire bodies while the two Therian children were barely covered.  I turned to the front door.  "Riley it is right?  You may not understand or believe, but long before there were guns.  Sticks and swords were the way of men in battle.  You fight people who are using your technology, but your technology is limited now in this world.  Ammo is limited.  Metal is limited.  Rocks and Sticks are plenty."  I sat down on the overly enveloping sofa behind me, "And I'm not teaching them to fight our war.  I'm teaching them how to defend themselves if necessary."

He still looked disgusted at me.  Tony stepped in between us, "You will never agree, just drop it."  Riley rolled his eyes at me.  

Tony put his arm around me and led me away to a dark room.  He opened the door and two figured quickly hid in the blankets.  I laughed.  "I saw you two.  I'd never have thought it, but good for you."  

Alec chuckled beneath the blankets and Valentine shushed him.  It made me smile.  Tony shut the door and whispered, "I hope I didn't ruin their mood."  He grinned at me.

He put his arm around me and pulled me in close to him.  "We could be.."  I felt what he'd meant; I smiled at him and let him lead me to another empty room.  It was good to wind down in Tony's arms.  It was good to be with him without interruption.  We made love and then we slept until the next evening.  

We played the same game for several days.  Rumors of the training must have been moving from conclave to conclave.  More people began to show up to learn from Il Cane.  But with positive rumors there would always be negative ones.  

Ryan and Ant were teaching the students and I watched.  Tony and Francesco came to sit with me as I watched.   We sat in silence and watched.

Francesco leaned forward and turned to us so only we could hear.  "I think it's time we left."

I nodded, "Well past time."

Tony frowned, "What will we do?"

I smiled, "We'll go to the next conclave, until it becomes too dangerous.  We work our way to Valence, but we train those along the way, we befriend all we can.  We will need all the friends we can get in the end."

Francesco nodded, "See your girl has a military mind even if she is not a leader."

Tony hugged me and Francesco looked away.  I laughed, "He's still squeamish with me."  

I stood up and kissed Francesco on the cheek, "No need to look away, no one judges you."

I could feel his eyes on me as I walked to Ant and Ryan.  They halted their lessons for me to speak.  "Today is our last lesson here.  We must move for the safety of your homes and persons."  There were no questions or stunned looks; they knew the day had been coming.  I smiled at them, "It has been a pleasure being with you here.  May our paths cross again."

# Moving On

Once the lesson was over for the night, we all went to gather what few things we possessed.  Long since the day where we had actual things to pack.  We lived on the charity of others now.  It was that way for most people these days it seemed.   It was nice to have friends.  

While I helped the children gather their homemade dolls and wooden sticks, Alec and Valentine came to me with sad smiles.

Alec cleared his throat.  I stopped and turned to him.  He actually wanted my attention.   "Can we talk a moment?"  

I nodded, "Yeah, sure."

Valentine smiled, "We have something to ask you?"

"The answer is yes."  I already knew what they wanted to ask, I expected some of them to want to stay.  Going to war was tiring and they'd been doing it for about 18 years now.

Valentine, "See you have a bit of Auspex."

I shook my head, "No, I expected some of us to want to stay here."

Alec sighed with relief.  "I was afraid you might be speaking of something else.  Or not let us stay at all."

"Why wouldn't I let you stay?"  I smiled, "I'm not your boss.  If anything you shouldn't be asking me."

Alec nodded, "Yeah, but things have changed.  People answer to Il Cane now.  We come when you call."

Valentine included, "And we do so because we when it's needed.  We are yours, we will come if you call, but we'd like to stay here until you have need of us."

I smiled, "I will come when you call."  I bowed slightly.  

Valentine chuckled.  "We know you are loyal to a fault."  Valentine hugged me.  I returned the embrace with a smile.  How things had changed.  I didn't even think Valentine liked me once upon a time, I guess I was wrong.

Valentine smiled, "You weren't wrong.  You are being very loud.  I didn't like you once upon a time. It's why your training was slack.  But since coming to the New World, I've come to find you rather comforting in an odd sort of way.  I did not wish  you dead, then or now, and your directness is always refreshing.  I know you think what you say and it's good to have the two minds meeting, unlike other people."

I nodded.  Alec laughed, "You know how I felt about you.  But I also was slack in your training. Though I see you don't need much more than the skill of intimidation.  You are the only vampire I know who pulls it off without trying."  He laughed, "I've seen Francesco and even Tony try.  Only Ant comes anywhere near you."

I smiled, "They just aren't scary.  They are too cute to be scary."  Valentine laughed and nodded.

Alec put his arm around Valentine, "We'll leave you to your packing.  Thank you Il Cane."

"Cari."  I corrected.

He laughed on his way out.  They spoke softly to one another as they parted.  I didn't bother trying to listen.  It didn't matter.   The council was down two members.  I sighed as I thought of Damian and that brought thoughts of Mia.  I fought back the sadness.  Morgan put her hand on my arm, "Mommy?"

I blinked, had she really said something.  I knelt in front of her, "Yes Morgan."

She smiled at me then hugged me, "Don't be sad."

I hugged my daughter.  She was trying to comfort me.  Both of the girls were strong in their respective powers.  It seemed they had split them straight down the middle.  I wondered if they would have any aspects of the other.  But we had years to find out.  "I'll try.  Are you done gathering your things?  We need to go before night ends."

Carissa nodded, "Done."  I smiled and hugged her as well.  

"I'm glad you are learning to speak.  It is music to my ears."  I waved to the other two to join us.  They joined and we fell over, the children in a giggling mass.  

William walked in on us trying to right ourselves.  He watched with amusement in his eyes.  "Il Cane, we wish to speak with you outside, if it pleases you."

I nodded and got up, "Finish getting things together then come outside."  They all nodded and continued their giggling.  I smiled.

I followed William out of the house by the sea where a mass of people stood.  Tony already waited for me with Francesco and Aurora.  I took a spot by Tony.  He put his arm around my shoulders and pulled me close to him.

William nodded to those he was with then he turned to our gathering.  "Il Cane, we offer you replenishment for Il Mandria di Cane.  Our conclave would be honored if you'd take the top choices of our conclave to join you in your travels."

Aurora asked, "Do they know what they offer?"

A woman, I think it was William's daughter answered, "Yes, we offer blood and in return we get long life for as long as we wish it to be."

Ant stepped in next to me.  I hadn't seen him before, he smiled.  Ryan stood next to him.  It was Ryan who spoke first, "It is more than that, but yes I guess that's the gist of it.  Who comes as the offering?"

She stepped forward.  "I am Sarah."

Tony asked, "What did you do before the war?"

Sarah smiled, "I was a school teacher.  I have been teaching the children while they are here."

Tony nodded.  "What would you ask in return for the services you'd render the children of our family?"

Sarah smiled, "Only one thing.  That my children be allowed to travel with us."

Tony looked at me and I smiled they were welcome as far as I was concerned.  "Offer accepted.  But what of your husband?"

Riley stepped forward.  "I am her husband, and I've offered myself."

Ant asked with a smile, "What did you do before the war?"

Riley looked perturbed, "You know what I did."  

His wife poked him, "It's ceremony."

Riley looked ashamed, "I was a Colonel in the marines."

Tony asked, "What would you ask in return for your services rendered to our plans?"

Riley smiled, "Only that my children can travel with us under your protection."

Ryan nodded, "Offer accepted."

Sarah and Riley were waved to come to me.  I sliced my wrist and offered it to Sarah.  She took it and drank deeply.  She offered my her arm.  I spoke the ancient words and bit into her wrist.  She shuttered under my power and I felt her flush with desire.   I withdrew to see her husband staring at her.    I smiled and offered him my wrist and he hesitated before offering me his wrist.  I bit and he gave the same reaction.  I felt them both come into my mind.  They were both foggy with desire.  

Riley stepped in and whispered, "Is it always like that?"

I nodded, "It can be."  He blushed.

Sarah was still red in the face, but she didn't hide her question, "Can we do that together?"

"You mean feed together?"  I looked to Ryan.

Ryan spoke softly, "It's not suggested, but..."  Ryan spoke to the crowd, "Is there another volunteer so that the family that travels with us may feed at the same time."

William smiled, "We have alternates available."

Tony nodded, "Next."

We followed the ceremony to honor the conclave.  Normally we'd not have done so, but it wasn't for us.  There was Andrew.  He used to be a minor political adviser.  He didn't believe he could offer us any advice as we were military so he didn't ask for additional compensation.  I think he would find his opinion would carry weight with most of us.  Advice was advice no matter who it came from.

Trey was a firefighter and asked for no extra compensation.  It seemed to me the conclave didn't think much of their old skills.  We'd value the hero more than thought.  When this war was over, we'd discuss all compensations again.

Chris was a dancer.  I laughed when he said he didn't think he had anything to offer.  But he asked for nothing in return despite my encouragement that he was valuable.

Sam said he was nothing special, a jack of all trades.  He was a contractor for a major construction company.  Nothing was asked for in return.

Mark was the only one who asked for compensation.  He wanted to tell our story.  He was a journalist.  We agreed.

By the time the ceremony was over the children had fallen asleep and daylight approached.  We'd move as soon as night fell again.  It gave the new comers time to gather things together.  And we could make the necessary adjustments to our plan.  Tony, Ant, the children and I all slept in the same bed.   It might be the last bed we'd share for a while.

# The Clan

Night came and everyone appeared ready, that was until we had an unexpected guest.  Out of the shadow I was standing in while waiting forever one I was fallen into.  No one was there and then suddenly Henry and Nicola were falling on top of me.  It seemed Henry was an overly accurate shadow walker.  He got up and helped Nicola up.  He dusted off before he held out a shy hand to me.

I sat on the ground looking up at Tony's son with a questioning look.  He blushed.

"I'm sorry.  We wanted to come see you."  Henry spoke cautiously, or maybe that's what it sounded like as Nicola was already blurting into my mind, "We mated."

I smiled up at Henry, and he must have taken it as a command to blurt it out, "We mated.  Me and Nicola."

I nodded, "So I've heard."

Henry looked at Nicola and his blush brightened.  He looked down at his feet.  I laughed.  "I'm happy for you."

Henry squatted to whisper to me, "You think my Dad or Granddad will be angry?"

I shook my head, "No, they've done the same."

He laughed with relief, "But you better tell them before Nicola does."

He stood up and hurried to find his father and grandfather.  Nicola fell into my lap hugging me.  "I knew you'd be happy."

I hugged the seven hundred year old 16 year old tightly, "I'm glad you are happy and found someone to love you for all you are." 

She hugged me tighter and cried happy tears into my shoulder.  

Ant and Ryan followed by the six children came out of the house to see the spectacle.  I laughed, "She's happy."  Ryan picked Nicola up effortlessly and she clung to him as Ant helped me up.  

Nicola squeaked, "I'm mated." 

Ryan hugged her then put her down.  "Congratulations.  Who's the lucky man?"

Ant hugged Nicola.  "Henry?"  He asked with a shocked question.  She must have spoke in his mind.  

Nicola nodded quickly.  Ant smiled, "Welcome to the family officially then Nicola."

I corrected Ant, "Technically she has always been part of the family."

Ant shrugged, "Like a bastard child I guess."

I nodded, "But she was family.  She's just more so now."

Tony and Henry came out in conversation and Francesco followed with Aurora with a smile on his face, he almost beamed with pride.  Behind them Dimitri came carrying a bird on his shoulder.  Carissa cried out, "Arghhhh"

Dimitri laughed and the bird flew into the heavens.  The new Il Mandria di Cane came out of the house carrying a few items, mostly food stuffs they'd been given for the journey.  Hopefully we'd not have to use it at all, but it was a very nice gesture.

We were all here with two extras.  It appeared Henry and Nicola were coming with us.

The conclave stood around us waving and crying and shouting encouragement.  Between Henry, Tony, Francesco, Ant and myself we could easily take this crowd to our next place.  We stepped into the shadows.

We stepped out of the shadow I felt the buzzing of a ward surrounding us.  I shouted, "Hold.  No one move."

It was hard not to move.  I didn't even know how big the ward was or what it would do.  It felt similar but different to the ward that was around the place between.  Francesco sighed, "I know this magic, though I had not expected it here."

I didn't wait for Francesco's explanation; I sent my power seeking a familiar signature, or a response to mine.  I found nothing.  "Nothing here I recognize."

A man stepped out of the shadows, he was elderly and the power wafted from his being.  Everyone stared at him even I was in awe of the power.  "I doubt you will Il Cane, though I know you."

Francesco laughed, "Just let us out you old fool."

The man smiled but gave Francesco a look that said quiet without him saying a word.  

Tony smiled. "Father, please let us out."

The man shook his head, "We've much to discus and you will listen in there."

I sat down this was going to be a while.  The man laughed at me, "I'm glad I amuse you."

He laughed harder.  "She's very direct my son."

Tony and Francesco spoke in unison, "She is."

I looked up at Tony, "Who is he?"

Tony held his hand out indicating the man before us.  "Cari, this is Donatello Giovanni, my grandfather."  He smiled at his grandfather, "Father, I'd like to introduce you to Il Cane."  While Tony was introducing us I was examining the ward and found the catch.  I broke the catch and the ward fell in a silence I'd never seen happen.

Donatello smiled, 'I'd shake your hand, but you are inside the ward."  He looked at me with sly expression, "You little minx."

I smiled at him and shushed him.  He laughed.

Tony sat down next to me and the girls climbed into our laps.  Leyla and Lee sat at our sides curling up at our sides resting their heads on our shoulders.  Everyone else just stood there and waited.  I guess they were impatient to be free.  Donatello nor I told them they could move.  He wanted to speak to us, I would allow it, but I would not allow us to be hurt.

"So Father what do we need to speak of."  Francesco asked impatiently.

Donatello looked at his son, "The world has changed much since you made this one."  Francesco nodded.  "She brings new hope, new terror and new ways with her.  Some do not embrace it, but you follow her without question."

Francesco laughed, "I wouldn't say without question.  But yes I follow the child."

Donatello corrected, "Elder."

"What?"  I asked quickly.

He turned to me, "You are Elder.  You are Clan."

"I'm not Elder nor Clan."

"You are mated to him aren't you?"  He nodded to Tony.

"Yes, but not by your standards."

Donatello laughed, "You are mated.  You are clan.  We will make official.  You will be consort.  Sierra is dead.  He is entitled a second."

Tony started to stand up but I put my hand on his knee and he sat back down but he didn't stay quiet, "Cari is not consort, she is Il Cane."

"And?"  Donatello waited for Tony's explanation that seemed to never come.  "And what does that have to do with anything my son?"

Tony sighed.  I spoke instead, "I am not consort.  I am Death."

Donatello took a step closer but stopped short as he remembered his ruse.  "Even Death has a consort, Il Cane.  Are you two not happy?"

Tony was offended, "We are, but we are not Clan."

Donatello smiled, "We can fix that.  Your Il Cane brings new ways.  We... no, I accept them.  You mated before Sierra.  You held to mates.  But your bond is strong, stronger than any I've ever felt.  All of your bonds are stronger than anything I've ever felt."

Aurora spoke cautiously, "You feel more than the mating."

He raised an eye brown.  "Do I?"

She nodded, "They are bound in many - Wiccan, Chevalier and mated."

Donatello's mouth formed an O.  He hadn't known that much.  "And the children?  Can you explain that?"

Francesco nodded, "Father, she is an amplifier.  She amplifies powers given to her.  Her children and herself feed on one another's power, increasing each other's."

Donatello nodded, "That explains much."  He stood and stroked his long white beard with his fingers.  "You will all become Clan, even the humans if they desire."

I spoke for most of them, "They don't.  Only one is Chevalier, all others are lesser."

He looked at the crowd and nodded, "Which one is Chevalier and whose?"  Ant and Ryan raised their hands.  "Do you wish to be Clan, Chevalier?"

Ryan nodded, "It would be an honor."

Donatello smiled, "First, young man drop your veil so that I may see your true face."

I looked up at Ant, I had not noticed he'd veiled.  He was use to hiding who he was among the Clans.  There was no doubt he was Tony's son, and Donatello looked back at Tony and I with a shocked face and then turned to ask Ant, "How many years have you lived?"

Ant smiled, "Over 700 years."

Tony clarified, "I only found out 17 years ago I had another son."

Donatello nodded and looked at me, "You little minx."

I laughed.  Donatello waved his hand, "You may all join us."

I laughed harder.  Tony looked at me with questioning eyes, "I dropped the ward before I sat down."

Donatello looked at me in mock fury, "You little minx."

I looked up at him and smiled and turned to Tony, "I think he likes calling me that."

Tony stood up with a smile and held out a hand to help me up, which I graciously accepted.

# Joining The Family

Donatello held his hand out to me.  "Come child.  Let us speak alone, away from the prying ears of your men."

The term made me slightly unease.  Donatello noticed my ill-ease, "I meant your followers.  I did not mean to bring something up that is best forgotten."

We walked away from everyone. I could feel Tony watching me as I went with his grandfather.  He was sending me luck through our connections.  I sent reassurance back.  I'd be fine.  "What do you know of what should stay forgotten?"

Donatello opened a door in a tree.  I blinked and looked again.  The shadow veil was strong here and it took a second look to see the building that stood here and not the tree.  Donatello smiled.  "Shadow is strongest, yes?"

"Yes."  I nodded and walked into the open door. Donatello followed and took a chair by the table. 

"Come sit with me."  He smiled, "As your question.  I know nothing of your situation, just the feeling you gave when I said your men.  But since it's here, perhaps you can shed light.  I do not want to offend your fellows."

I told Donatello of Tristan's betrayal and the damage he did to our relationships.

He smiled, "But there must be at least one good thing came of it?"

I nodded, "I learned what two sided love should be."

"See, the silver lining."  He patted my hand.  "I pulled you aside so that I may speak with you upon Clan matters, most importantly the joining of your Clan and ours."

"My clan?"

'Your lot, your friends, your family."  I nodded.  He continued, "I sensed many connections.  I fear my son and the others will not be honest.  But you will be, I hear it is your nature."

I nodded, "Only Dimitri is not officially tied to anyone in your family, of those that came with us anyway.  Francesco and Aurora married about 5 years ago.  I assume that means they mated.  Henry and Nicola mated in the very recent past.   Ryan is Ant's Chevalier.  Oh and the children.  Leyla and Lee are Therian's.  Lee is Ryan's sister, Mia and Damian's adopted son.  Sadly they passed in the war.  The rest of the humans are my lesser Chevalier."

Donatello nodded, "Il Mandria di Cane.  How can we bring Dimitri into the family?"

I smiled, "You should ask him if he wants to.  He is Animal Ken.  He isn't vampire or human friendly in most cases."

"He follows you."

"Dimitri is my friend and one of my sires."

"Oh, that's different, he's family.  Who else sired you?"  He was full of questions.

"Aurora, Damian, and Dimitri, two others on our side, Alec and Valentine, and five on the other side of this war.  I've killed one, Salvador.  I intend to kill Nate, Evangeline, Desmond and Virgil."

"We never knew the full extent to your council.  It is good to know that they had a split as our Elders did."

I sighed, "I am not Elder."

He chuckled, "You are Elder.  You are one of the most power vampires I have ever known.  You rival myself and you are stronger than my son."

"And that means?"

"Nothing my dear, just you will be respected among our people and your opinion matters, and if you desire, a voice in all matters that will be heard.  You are not the politician.  I know that, but you are strong.  You are Elder."

I nodded.  "You realize I will kill your other son."

He looked away.  "I didn't know that was common knowledge."

"Francesco claimed him his brother once upon a time."

He tapped his fingers on the table, "Ah.  Yes I do know that.  I will help you.  I should have done it when he turned Embraced his first vampire."

I had to ask, "Would you kill any of your vampires who embraced a human?"

"No, but we should."

"I wouldn't be so hasty in that decision.  When I went rogue I killed a whole village.  Francesco and Tony found me and pulled me back from the brink of my own destruction.  One girl from the village clung to life.  She was about to die.  Francesco embraced her.  Nicola came with me and Tony and I took her as mine, even though I did not sire her.  I trained her.  She is forbidden by your culture, but Nicola is a sweet girl.  She refuses to drink blood from a human.  She will only drink from a cup.  It is because of what I did to her village."

Donatello thought about it.  "I see your point.  We all do things we regret, but sometimes things have a purpose."

I nodded and closed my eyes.  "I need to feed."

He stood up and walked me to the door.  "My child, we will join you to us after you've feed." Donatello whispered to me as I walked out of the door, "Do not feed on my grandson before the ceremony, it will taint the magic."

I nodded.  "I know."

He grabbed my arm, "How do you know?"

I smiled, "I know much about your blood line."

Aurora walked up behind me with a smile.  "She is a true Keeper of Secrets sir.  She knows much about many things.  But I've been sent to tell you we are ready."

I looked at Aurora, "I need to feed."

She looked back at me, "Make it fast I don't think they will be patient."

I rolled my eyes and nodded.  "Fine."

I bowed to Donatello and followed my connection to Tony to find someone to feed on.  I knew they wouldn't be far from Tony.  We had yet to establish a schedule, Sam volunteered to be first.  I graciously accepted.  I bit into his wrist and he shuddered, I pulled back on the bit and he eased into a calming pleasure.  He smiled stupidly. I suspect he looked like someone high on drugs.

As I withdrew robed figures can out of another tree and formed a circle around a fire.  They were blessing the fire.  Tony grabbed my hand and held tightly on to it.  I squeezed it back.  I'm not sure who was more afraid of this, he or I.

Donatello dropped his hood and motioned for Tony and I to come stand in front of him.  "Today we join Il Cane and Antonio Giovanni and welcome them into the clan.  Once joined, their family becomes ours.  We become blood.  We are Clan."

Donatello put his hand top of our heads.  I felt the death magic of vampirism.  Such a stupid name now that I thought about our origins.  I felt the magic flow into our bodies.  It was an odd feeling it from both sides.  Tony and I stared at each other in pure amazement.  A strange glow rose above our bodies.  Donatello tied the glows and dropped his hands and the streams sprang into place inside us.  We had mated before, but this was different.  "Together they are bound."  He waved called forth Ant and the girls.  "And in these three children of their blood, their marriage has been consummated."  The old man stretched his arms out to include all of the family, "And the  rest join us through blood of their blood."  

The crowd chanted in unison, "We are Clan"

# Not Part Of The Plan

The magic from the ceremony hung in the air.  I could feel it, it wasn't done, but it waited for something.  Everyone gathered around us and congratulated Tony.  They shook his hand and welcomed him into the Clan.  No one was paying any attention to me nor to the near glow that hung on the air.  I stepped towards the fire and I could feel more power, it wasn't finished but nothing happened.  A woman came near the fire and spoke to me.  "It's not easy being Elder and newly wed.  The Clan does not know what to do around you."

I shrugged, "You don't feel it?"

She looked around, "Feel what child?"

"The magic that's hanging in the air."  

She looked around and concentrated.  "No I'm sorry.  But I am not nearly as strong as you.  I remember when my husband became Elder."

I looked over at her, "Who is your husband?"

She smiled, "You don't know already?"

I turned back to the magic, "I'd guess you are Tony's grandmother."

She touched her nose.  I was right.  "I'm Meelah Lewis-Giovanni."

I turned and bowed, "A pleasure to meet you.  What's with the dual last name with ya'll?"

"Do you not wish to keep your last name?"

I laughed.  "I think Cari Giovanni-Giovanni would be a bit much."

Meelah laughed, "You are probably right."  She stopped a moment and leaned in, "The girls are Marshall-Giovanni."

I sighed and turned back to the magic lingering.  "We thought they were from two different fathers.  But he betrayed us and the girls are both clearly linked to Tony.  He manipulated things to make us believe what he wanted us to."

He patted my back.  I stared at the lingering magic, it was building.  I felt things low inside me stir.  I whispered, "The consummation."

"Pardon?"

"That's why the magic is lingering."  I was slowly figuring it out.

"Usually it is part of the ceremony, but we don't normally preform the ceremony on prior mated souls.  You still feel it?"

I nodded, "I see it."

Meelah turned to leave, "I will speak with my husband."

I turned to stop her but I caught sight of Tony and I knew what had to be done.  I pushed my way through the crowd.  I took Tony's hand and lead him to a bare patch of ground and took off my shirt.  The crowd parted and the chattering stopped as they all watched.  I pulled Tony close to me.  I smiled up at him.  "They want this.  Can you, for me?"

Tony nodded and kept his eyes on me.  He blushed but he took off his shirt and I nestled my face into the crook of his neck and I took in his scent.  I had a sudden urge to bit him.  He pulled me away from him and he pulled my clothes from my body kissing my body as he removed them.  I unbuttoned his pants and we stood naked in the middle of the mountain sanctuary.  We were not alone, but there was nothing but us and the magic.

Tony picked up my chin, you are ripe.  I nodded, "Its okay.  Trust me.  I trust them."

He kissed me, "Who?"

I lay down on the earth beneath our feet pulling Tony on top of me.  I still had the urge to bit him, "The spirits, the magic, the earth.  I don't know, but we must do this."  I kissed his neck and he moaned with pleasure.  I bit his neck and drank of his blood.  His head reeled back and he drove himself inside of me.  We made love and it was probably the best we'd had in a very long time.

I felt the magic flow inside me as my body spasmed in the last climax I gasped for air.  I chocked on air coming into my lungs.  I felt my heart beat.  I shuttered with the magic flowing through me.  Tony grabbed me and tried to stop me, he tried to understand.  My eyes rolled into the back of my head and there was nothing but the searing pain.

When I woke I was staring into the bright sun overhead.  I panicked.  I sprang to my feet searching for cover.  I was alone.  Why was I alone?  I blinked and saw figures materialize out of nothing.

Three souls who were gone stood before me in wide smiles.  Thea reached her hand out, "Calm, Cari.  You are not dead, far from it.  You must breathe"

Mia took my hand, "Calm Cari.  Breathe.  Live"

A woman I barely remembers smiled at me.  "Prophecy fulfilled.  Potential gained.  Breathe child"

I took a deep breath and I woke to Tony cradling my head in his lap, rocking back and forth.  I opened my eyes and saw a circle of people around me.  Ant put his hand on Tony's shoulder.  "She's okay.  Look she's breathing."

Tony looked at me, "What the hell was that?"

I tried to sit up but Tony kept me lying down.  "Sit still until Father can look at you."

I only stayed because it wasn't worth fighting.  "I saw Thea's grandmother, the one who bound us."  Tony looked at me in silence, he knew who I meant.  "She said, prophecy fulfilled, potential gained.  Do you know what she meant?"

He pulled me up into his arms and hugged me tightly, "I always thought she meant your death."

I smiled, "Maybe it was at the time, but I don't think so."

I turned around and sat myself in his lap facing him. I wrapped my body around him, we were both still naked and it was probably not a good idea.  I buried my face into his neck.  I whispered, "I hear my pulse, I need to eat, or it's going to drive me insane."  I took a deep breathe.

Tony picked me up and carried me to someplace I couldn't tell, he sat me down and threw a blanket at me as he pulled one around himself.  "I'll bring you Andrew.  It's his turn."

I nodded and I sat on the couch, trying to remember to breathe.  Over eight hundred years of not having to my body has having a difficult time adjusting.  I held my arms in front of me and watched my pulse race.  I fought the urge to bit myself.  It would do little good.  I don't know how long I stared before Tony returned with Andrew and Trey.  Tony took my wrists and made me look at the men before me.  Andrew offered me his wrist.  I only had eyes for the pulse in his throat.  He smiled and turned his back and knelt before me.  I wrapped my arms around him and smelled the soft scent of his skin before sinking my fangs into his neck.  

The copper liquid tasted far greater than it had ever before.  Tony had to pull me off of Andrew.  I licked my lips, "I'm sorry."  

Andrew laughed, "It's okay.  I don't think I've ever felt anything like that, not even before when you fed.  It wasn't the same, it was better."

Trey handed me his wrist and I took the offering, before biting, "Take no offense, I don't want Tony to have to pull me off of you."  

Trey smiled, "Thanks."  I bit into his wrist and it was much easier to pull free.  But I wasn't sure I liked this new found thirst.

Tony laughed, "You feed like a teenager on their first feeding."  His own words made him sit down in stunned silence.  "You are reborn."  He turned to me, "Did you know this would happen?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I just knew we had to."

He put his hand on my belly.  "The child was there, I felt conception.  But it's not there now."

I smiled, "I don't think it was ever a real child."  

Meelah stepped out of the shadows, "Your grandfather believes that the child was just a form of her rebirth.  She is Clan."

I took another deep breath, nearly gasping for air.  This was going to take time and the only thing I could hear was the blood rushing through my veins.  Tony said something but I hadn't heard.

He grabbed my hand and I turned to look at him, "Cari?  Are you okay?  Nana, she's turning blue."

I gasped for air.  I concentrated on my breathing, Meelah smiled, "She's been dead for almost a millennium, what did you expect?"

I tried to talk but breathing and talking were difficult.  I tried again, "All I hear is my pulse."

Tony smiled, "You hear everyone else's all the time.  Focus on something else."  I glared at him.  "I know I don't know what you feel, but focus on something else."

Ryan came in carrying my weapons.  He laid the swords on the couch where I sat.  "The girls thought it wasn't a good idea to have them out.  I agreed.  Can you tell me what happened?  Ant's different.  He's staring at the east horizon."

I turned to Meelah, she shrugged.  "How soon till sunrise?"

Tony panicked, "Not long.  I feel it coming up."

Aurora and Dimitri came running inside and skidded to a halt, "We can't feel her.  She's no longer here, we thought the worst."

Tony smiled, "She'd probably agree that it's pretty bad right now."

I stared at my swords, not really caring about anything.  "Get Ant inside to be safe."

Ryan laughed, "I already tried. He won't come."

I started looking around.  Meelah handed me a simple dress.  I pulled it on and went outside.  The sun was starting to rise.  The shadows were long but most of the village was covered in shadows still.  I made my way to the edge of the village and saw Ant standing in the first sunbeam of his life.  He didn't burn.  He stood bathed in the golden glory.  He turned and stared at me.  He smiled.  I walked out to him and the sun was warm on my skin but it didn't burn.  The light hurt my eyes.  

"Close your eyes."  He pulled me towards him and wrapped me in his arms.  We both basked in the sun.

I heard others coming up.  I heard the girls running from sunbeam to shadow in fits of giggles.  I felt Tony through our numerous connections, he seemed overly joyous.  

Meelah and others asked, "What are they doing?"

Tony laughed, "This is Ant's first sun beam ever, and Cari hasn't felt the sun's warmth in as many years."

I spoke softly to Ant, "I can't think with this pulse."

Ant held me softly, "We can fix that.  Just wait."

I felt another person coming at a run.  But what I heard made me feel stupid.  Ryan was coming with my swords.  I smiled at Ant.  I tried to open my eyes, but the sun was too bright.  Even with my back to the rising sun.  Tony said, "Just keep them closed, we'll find you something until you are used to the sun."

Tony strapped the swords to my waist.  

More people from the crowd wondered what I was going to do.  I drew the sword from my sheath, the ring of the steel made my heart sing.  I swung the sword through the air and listened to the whistle of the metal moving through the air.  I focused on the steal, the sounds of the earth under my bare feet.  I focused on anything and everything except the pulse in my ear.  

I felt people come and go as I moved through the motions.  I stumbled over my own blade, my feet.  Ant steadied me, "You have a new beat, listen to it.  Use it."  He was taking his instructor tone with me.

I listened to my heart and tried to find the new rhythm.  I couldn't see the crowd that had formed but I could feel people watching me.  Tony called out, "Stop."  I made the put the sword into an off sheath position.  I could feel him walking towards me.  He placed something on my face.  "Open your eyes, slowly."

I tried to.  I blinked and the world was darker.  I touched my face with my free hand.  He'd found sun glasses, I smiled at my love.  I kissed him.  He smiled, "I knew you'd like that, we'll find you a better pair, but these will do for now."

Ant laughed, "Why don't I need them?"

Tony shrugged, "Dude, I don't know, but probably because you were already living.  Apparently the change in your mother went down to her children.  She changed your entire line."

A small voice from the crowd, "You've sent the Elder's into conclave.  They are discussing things."  I didn't recognize the voice, I turned to find it.  And when I did I was surprised to find a small girl.  

I knelt down to her level. "Do you think I should be there?"

She shook her head in embarrassment, "I'd rather watch you."  A chorus of other children shouted "more"

I smiled and I obliged them.  I nodded to Ant to continue.  I had taught him so many years ago, it was his turn to help me find my footing again.  

Tony laughed, "I bet we could beat her now."

Ant smiled, "For about another hour.  But after that I won't take that bet."

Ryan nodded and Tony laughed they all drew their swords.  "First blood?" I asked.  All three agreed.  I smiled, "Do I have to bleed you all or just one?"

Ant looked at Ryan, Ryan smiled, "All of us."

I nodded.  "Rules established, shall we?"

I pushed the nose piece of the sunglasses up and drew both my swords.  Ryan called, "No fair", I smiled.

They circled me, and I focused on my own heart beat and theirs.  I found my rhythm.  I dodged the first attack.  The sunglasses kept slipping.  I closed my eyes and tossed them out of our area.  Tony sighed, "She's going to kick our asses."

I focused on their sounds, their heart beats.  I found mine and I moved to them.  I blocked and parried.  I slashed and thrust at the men circling me.   There was nothing but the battle.  Nothing but the sound of steel on steel.  It was a glorious day.  The sun beamed down on us, the swords rang against each other as we fought.  I drew first blood.  I do not know which of the three it was, but it didn't matter.  None were easy to beat.  

We circled each other and  I drew blood on another.  The last was being more cautious, I could feel him trying to change his own rhythm.  I knew it had to be Tony.  He was the only one who could read me.  But for that advantage it was also a disadvantage I could read him.  I thought too much and I was there before he was and I drew blood.  I smiled.  I held my hand out and a small hand put the glasses in there.  I nodded.  "Thank you."

I put the glasses back on and opened my eyes slowly.  I found the sun to be high in the sky.  Tony smiled as he put his arm around me, "How's the pulse?"

"Better."  I hugged him.  I held my arm out to Ant and Ryan.  "Thank you.  Who'd I bleed first?"  Ryan raised his hand.  I hugged him and kissed his cheek.  I went to Ant.  I bowed to him. "Thank you."  He hugged me and I returned it.  

"You are welcome.  I was hoping to beat you once, but you found yourself."  Ant smiled.  "Maybe one day."

"Maybe one day."  I agree.

Meelah came out of a building with a smile, "If it please the lot of you, we'd like your presence in the conclave."

Tony asked, "All of us?"

Meelah nodded and we all followed.

The room the conclave was in was huge for the size of the building.  It was covered in things of unknown decent and many things shimmered with veils.  I smiled as their words became clear to me as I walked past them.  

A round table stood before us.  "As new clan members we ask that you unshield and unveil in this room so we may assess your potential and rank you accordingly."

I closed my eyes and unshielded and unveiled myself.  The room shimmered as my power touched it.  There was stunned silence and then a murmur rose, "A true keeper?"

For once it wasn't the vine tattoo that brought their eyes.  Tony unveiled and his power fell in with mine and the room glowed brighter.  I was thankful for the sunglasses, but no one seemed to be squinting.  Ant followed suit and the room grew brighter.  I shielded my eyes.  Francesco's power made me close my eyes completely.

Tony put his hand on my shoulder.  "You can shield, it's over and you can open your eyes.  Only the eldest can see the powers in this room."

I sighed, "I don't want to be Eldest."  

"Everyone take your seat.  It will glow only for you."  Donatello called the meeting to order.

I stood where I had as I saw the seat that glowed for me.  There was no head of the table, but I knew what that seat meant opposite the door.  I was the most powerful vampire in the Clan.  I was not just Elder, I was Eldest.  

To my right sat Donatello, to his right was Tony then Francesco the rest I did not know.  To my left would be the weakest of the Elders.  Donatello smiled, "You do not want Eldest?  You may pass the responsibility to your Vicar."

"And who is my Vicar?"  I had no idea what he was talking about.  To my knowledge no one every passed up the opportunity to be Eldest.

Francesco smiled, "Whomever you please, Eldest, but Eldest is your title and yours no matter your responsibility."

Donatello nodded.  "Your Vicar will be the pivot on which you place balance."

"I get to choose?  How can I do that I don't know most of you."

Donatello smiled, "You will know."

I opened myself to the magic of the room.  Maybe it would help.  I saw the lights dim and Donatello was lit with a halo of golden power.  I smiled and drew the door to the magic closed.  "If it pleases you, Donatello Giovanni, will be my Vicar?"

He nodded, "See I knew you'd know.  The conclave trusts the power of this room.  You are learning well Eldest."

I came to my chair and sat down.  The rest sat except for Donatello.  "As Vicar, my left, " He held his hand above my head, "And my right hands, "  He held his hand above Tony, are the balance of this Clan.  "The strongest and the weakest to provide balance to the clan."  He sat down.  "Our first order of business is brought to us by Aurora DeJesus."  

Aurora came through the door and set a heavy black book on the table.  "Your keeper should keep this safe."

Donatello asked, "What is it?"

I'd seen the book before.  I'd read it.  The book was passed from person to person at the table while they tried to figure it out.  Aurora looked at me with a smile.  The book came to rest before me.  Donatello looked at me, "What is it?"

I turned to him.  "It's the history of the world written by one of the First."

He looked at me as if I was speaking in tongues.  "The First are only legends."

I smiled, "You are legends to my kind.  Day walking vampires who live amongst humans as a human.  I only know what I read Vicar."

He nodded and took the book before him, "But there is nothing here."

I looked at  Aurora, she nodded.  I touched the book and and the words sprang from mist.  The room sat in stunned silence.  Aurora spoke softly, "She is a True Keeper of Secrets, and that is why I come.  While she slept we removed her protections and artifacts hid in our former compound.  There are things the other side cannot find."

I smiled, "We will go after we kill Valence."

Donatello looked me with a great smile.  "The Eldest has spoken.  I assume you have a plan."

Tony laughed, "It's not so much a plan as this is what she's going to do."

Tony filled the Elder circle in on the plan.  The hoping to places until we got to where Valence was said to be and kill him. 

The man sitting next to me, "And after that."

"We'll deal with that after we kill Valence.  I have a way into the compound no one but I can get out of.  Some of the most dangerous artifacts lie there, but it is dangerous and we will have to bar the entrance again once we are inside."  

The man smiled, "You have more of a plan then?"

"We have to kill the four remaining council after Valence.  They will be the most dangerous.  And then we will kill Brandon.  The logistics I've left to others."

A man came running into the room.  "Therians like I've never seen are on our border wanting to speak to the Vampire Queen.  We have no queen."

I sighed, "That is what the Fat Wolf King called me."

# The Therian Cluster

Everyone left the meeting room.  They were talking in hushed tones.  The sun was well into the day.  I was feeling weak, and tired and hungry.  Tony put his arm around my waist, he smiled weakly at me.  "We'll eat after this.   You've had a rough day."

I laughed, that was an understatement.  Three beasts stood on the edge of the forest.  Everyone but Tony and I had stopped to stare in wonderment.  They were unlike any Therian I had ever seen.  They were beasts in man form; it was the only possible way to explain their shape.  A guttural human voice came from the beast man's snout, "We wish to speak to the Vampire Queen."

"I am Il Cane."

The three men bowed deeply.  "We come to request an alliance."

"Funny, I was going to come find your kind to do the same thing."  I smiled and the man who'd spoken grinned at me through his muzzle, it looked more like a snarl than a grin but I knew what it was.  He did not frighten me.

"I am Bernard and my fellows are Carl and Simon.  We are envoys and leaders of the Therian Cluster.  We are the First."

I nodded and bowed slightly to their titles.  They howled in joy.  "You know of us."

"You are the cursed of the First who embraced a human to become vampire."  They howled again.  "You are the parent beings of both cursed vampires and diseased Therians."  They howled again in acknowledgement.

The rest of the circle found themselves at my back in time to hear what I said.  "We seek alliance with Il Cane della Morte.  We wish to put the world right."

I nodded, "What are your suggestions?"

"Come with us, speak to the clusters of Therians and bring with you the best of us to defeat the evils of this world."

"I will take all the help we can get.  But I have something I must do first."

Dimitri stepped out of the ground, the three Therians bowed before him.  "I will go with them Cari, on your behalf.  It would be my honor to be your envoy."

Another of the three spoke, Carl I think is name was, "It would be an honor to have the Beast King amongst us.  He has always been kind to us."

"Dimitri will speak on my behalf.  But he must first go see Alec and Valentine."

Aurora interrupted, "Francesco and I will go tell them.  We have plans to speak to you about as well."

I looked to Tony, he nodded and smiled. "Okay."  The children came running down the hill to the edge of the forest.  Carissa and Morgan hid behind our legs and peered at the great beings before us.  They smiled shyly at three beast men.  Leyla and Lee stood half the distance before they reached us.  They crept up beside us and clung to our legs.  The three men looked at us.  You could see the questions in their eyes, "Your children."

I nodded, "Adoptive, but Family none-the-less."

They bowed deeply to me again.  "She is kind to us."  They backed away into the shadows and Dimitri came to stand before me.  

"I will do my best to honor you, as you have always done for me."  He hugged me and I knew I would not see Dimitri again for a long time to come.

I watched as Dimitri disappeared into the darkening forest.  Night had fallen and I hadn't even noticed.  My stomach grumbled.  I looked down at it like it was some foreign object.  Tony laughed, "You are hungry.  You live. You need both blood and human food.  Both should sustain you, though I know you will always need more blood than most."  He smiled, "You are a blood thirsty little minx." I heard Donatello laugh behind me.

I turned to find only Francesco, Aurora, Donatello and the rest of my clan.  Ryan was carrying a basket with him.  He set it down at my feet and sat down and opened the lids.  Savory and sweet flavors wafted from the basket and my stomach grumbled loader.  I sat down to see what Ryan had brought.  He smiled at me, "I brought only my favorites."

Everyone else sat down and I took a piece of bread first, it stated the grumbling enough so that we could speak uninterrupted.  I looked at Aurora for an explanation.

She smiled, "Francesco and I are going to pave the way across the ocean.  They need to be freed too.  But I've something to tell you.  I've a secret I've not told you."

I took a bit of a red berry and it melted in my mouth.  I looked at Ryan, "Strawberry."

I turned back to Aurora and she continued, "The child you had."

I stopped mid chew and stared at her with near disgust.  "I know, I shouldn't have pried but I followed your human blood line, like I would follow my children's vampire lines.  You have a many great grandson who is leading the revolt on the other side of the ocean.  He does not know he is of your blood.   He is doing better than we did, if we help him with the backing of Il Cane, I'm sure we can take back the European governments."

I nodded and took another bite of something sour.  Ryan laughed, "You aren't supposed to eat it like that.  It's a lemon.  Watch.  He squirted it into his drink.  Lemon tea. Drink."

I did, it was okay.  I didn't really want it. I handed it back to him.  He stuck his tongue at me and drank the rest of the cup.  

Aurora interrupted, "That's all you have to say."

"Is it what you want to do?"  She nodded, " Will it help us?"  She nodded again.  "Then what would you like me to say?  To stay, I need you here?  What?"

She laughed, "I should have known your silence was acceptance.  But it would be nice to know that you need us here."

I took something else and took a bite.  I spit it out.  It was disgusting.  Ryan was having fits of laughter.  "You need to peel it.  You really never watched us eat did you?"  He took the yellow thing from me and pulled the skins down, "It's a banana,"

I took a bite, it was much better this time.  "I do need you.  I'd like for you to stay, but what I need or want is not always good for the whole."

Donatello smiled, "She is wise."

Aurora rolled her eyes, "You say that now.  Wait till she's doing it to you.  We've been listening to her direct to the point opinion for 800 years, it's not always nice."  

Donatello laughed, "It's refreshing to know someone means exactly what they say for a change."

Tony and Ryan guffawed.  "Seriously you don't know Cari.  She'll say something sometime that is the truth you'd rather not hear."  Tony leaned back, "Sex is just sex." Ryan and Ant laughed, and the three of them tossed some of my so called favorite sayings back and forth.  I shook my head and finished the banana.  I felt better.  Ryan offered me his wrist and I smiled, I took it graciously.  

Donatello laughed, "I've never seen a teenage vampire eat like her.  Never once has a newling taken both food and blood in the same sitting. A marvel she is."

# Vengeance

The next couple of days I relearned many things.  I still had trouble getting past my own pulse.  It made almost everything I did uneasy and awkward.  I practiced with my swords from sun up to sun up, with very little break between.  Ant stayed with me, he helped me to gather my wits about me as I did for him when he was a little boy.  He was repaying the favor, not that it was anything I didn't want to do.  He stayed with me even though he could have been with the Circle of Elders planning for our next battle.  I even told him he could go, but he stayed with me.  I think he liked the sun as much as I did.  The girls definitely did, they played all day in the sun.  They would play with Leyla and Lee in the bright sun shine.  It was a wonderful sight to watch.

The day finally came that Tony and the circle had a plan, one that just needed to be executed.  Tony had pulled me and Ant into a meeting.  The table was covered with maps and scraps of paper.  I took everything in.  The main focus was on an old warehouse building.  That was the cannery Valence ran.  I still thought it was such a strange name for a blood bank.  But then again I suspect it was more like a canning plant than a blood bank, except their stock was human blood and their cattle were squeezed into spaces no man or woman should live in.  From the population numbers and the size of the cattle areas I knew it was probably only standing room.  It was no way to live at all.  Valence did not care, he just wanted his world. He wanted to rule with impunity.  He was a god in the world's eyes.  He and Brandon would die.  I would see to it, even if it was the last thing I did.

No one spoke when I had come into the room.  They just watched me as I took everything in.  I saw red X's in places.  Circles in other and dotted lines depicting guard paths.  I looked at Tony.  He smiled and he nodded.  Everyone sat down in their seats.  I stood above the map.  Tony stood beside me.  "The red X's are where silver guns are probably at, leaders, armories and high ranking officers.  The circles are stationary guards.  Our intel says there do not have silver.  The paths are the movements of the rotation of guards.  They change guards about every four hours, but it's a random interval."

Tony picked up a letter opener and drove it into an area on the map.  "That is where Valence is."

Another man picked up a green pen and started marking small x's on the map.  "These are cameras."  He picked up another pen, purple this time.  "These are heat sensors."  He looked up at me.  "You have to worry about them now."

I shook my head.  "No."  

Ant smiled, "We can control our body temperature.  It is the first thing we go over in basic training.  Cari may be new to being alive, but she is not new to technological advances like that.  She would typical show up as a cold spot.  She had to learn to regulate her body temperature to match the environment.  She is completely invisible when she wants to be."

Tony smiled, "See I told you she doesn't care about cameras and heat sensors.  Why do you doubt me?"

The all laughed softly as Tony chided the man.  He looked embarrassed.  I put my hand on his, "It is good information none-the-less.  We can use it."

He looked up at me.  I picked up my hand and raised a small flame above my palm. "Distraction."

He smiled at me.  I looked at Tony, "What's the plan?"

"You tell me?  I know you see it."  I smiled.  I took a pencil and I drew on the map our path.  I circled the distractions and the places we needed to hit.  

Tony nodded and frowned, "You intend to free them too?"

I looked at him, "Of course.  It's a perfect distraction."

"Who do you want to go with you?  You won't do this alone."  Tony looked concerned.

"It's your operation. I will do as I'm told."

Tony smiled, "Who do you want to go with you?  How would be most beneficial?"

I took a deep breath and looked at Tony.  He smiled, "You don't have to need me."

I smiled and kissed his cheek, "I think Ant would be best."

Tony laughed, "I figured so.  He kills two birds with one stone.  You get to have a tighter connection and he'll base you like he's been doing the past few days.  I'm man enough to know that I'm not what you need in battle."

Donatello laughed, "You are a bigger man than most if you give your consort over to your son for protection."

Tony smiled, "He's not protection.  He's a base.  Ryan and Ant have been with Cari through it all.  She trusts them with her life.  And her theirs."

Donatello smiled, "Like I said a bigger man than most."

The remaining time in the meeting was spent organizing the distractions.  We would make our move at dawn.  Walking in the daylight was never a better distraction.  And that alone would make Valence afraid.  

I tried to sleep.  But I couldn't.   The girls were staying behind.  It made me nervous.  Tony was sound asleep as I paced the floor back and forth.  I sat down on the couch to rest, but all I heard was my own heartbeat.  It made me get up and pace more.  I heard movement from one of the rooms.  I put my hand on the hilt of my sword ready for an attack, but it was only Ryan.  He came out rubbing his eyes.  "You really should sleep."

"I can't."  

He sat down on the couch, threw his legs up and leaned against the arm and patted the place between his legs.  "Come sit."  

I did as I was instructed.  He pulled me down to lay on top of him.  My head lay on his chest.  I could hear his hear beat, the comforting rhythm.  I closed my eyes and I focused on his heart beat and I drifted off to sleep.

At first the dreams were peaceful, starting out with Tony as a boy around the fountain.  Then the dreams turned grim.  A figure in dark robes chocked Tony.  And then it was me.  I was killing the little boy.  But it wasn't Tony anymore.  I was at the village I had slaughtered.  I felt each throat beneath my fingers.  I tasted every last drop of their blood as I drained it.  

I woke up with Ryan pushing me off of him.  He was trying to escape.  I looked at him and stared back at me with a shocked expression.  And then he pulled me close, "It's okay.  I didn't know what was happening.  You were asleep and then you bit me."

I closed my eyes.  "I'm sorry.  The dreams are back."

He held me close.  "It's okay."  He rubbed my back and his heart started to calm, and he was again at peace.  

I sighed with a deep breath.  "I'm sorry."

Ryan rocked me back and forth, "It's okay, it's new. It's all so new.  I just wish I was in your head, I could help more."

"I don't want you to die with me."

He put his cheek against the top of my head, "I know, but I would if you asked me to."

"I know I can't ask that of you or Ant."  

He pulled me away from him and I looked up at him, "We both will die for you."

I smiled, "I know Ry.  But you must live if I die.  I can't have you dead too.  Someone has to look after the girls."

He pulled me back in, "Okay, I promise.  But don't you die on me so soon."

I laughed, "I'll try."

We slept in peace or we tried.  We were both only half asleep most of the time.  But we were rested when Tony came and woke us up.  "It's time."

I changed my clothes.  I wore all black.  Tony leered at me when he saw what I was wearing.  He'd seen them before I was sure of it, but his look made me blush.  He and Ryan laughed at my reaction.  I smiled and shook my head at them.  "Let's go."

Ant fell in step with me.  He too was wearing all black.  He handed me a pair of sun glasses.  "These should fit."

I put them on and I danced around the ground and found they fit well. They didn't slide when I moved.  I smiled, "Thank you."

The circle of elders stood amongst the crowd and waited.  There were several groups of vampires and humans.  I saw Alec and Valentine and Francesco and Aurora.  Alec smiled, "We brought some help.  We can't help directly but we brought human and Therian."  

Dimitri stepped out of the middle of the crowd, "And I brought some additional Therians, all pledge to Il Cane's service."

I nodded, "It is an honor."  

Donatello smiled, "Everyone is in their units.  If you are all ready, at first, light walk."

I grabbed Tony and pulled him into me and I kissed him hard and knew that it could be our last.  He picked me up and I wrapped my arms and legs around him.  He held me close.  He set me down and smiled. "We will see each other again."

I nodded and took Ant's hand when the first ray of light hit the crystal in the middle of the camp we walked.

Ant and I stood in the shadows of the buildings just outside the Cannery.  It looked quiet.  Most of the people out would be humans.  The vampires would sleep.  We had that advantage.  Tony's group was going to be the first distraction.  They were going to set free the human prisoners.  Ryan and his group were going to provide distractions inside of their compound.  

We did not have a subtle plan.  It was noisy and presumptuous.  But we had the advantage.  When the alarms sounded Ant and I drew our weapons and we walked into the sunlight and we walked right up to their gates.  Bullets started to fly.  We blocked most with our weapons but a few hit us.  They hardly slowed us.  The gate on the other hand was a bit of a troublesome thing.  Ant started using his vampire strength to tear it open.  But we were getting fired upon.  I closed my eyes and I prayed to whatever gods would listen and I raised my hands.  Pillars of flame rose from the stone walls and the men in the middle cried out in pain.  I fought the urge to wretch at the smell. It was harder than I thought to do but I did not lose my breakfast.

Ant broke the last bolt free and gate fell inward and we walked into the cannery unhindered.  We walked through men and woman, slicing and dicing as if they were nothing more than the air.  Everything felt as if it was in slow motion.   But things were happening so fast, it was hard to keep straight.  We followed our path.  We avoided the silver but that was part of Ryan's job, to distract them so we could get to Valence.

We walked into the compound.  There was a mad dash in the direction of their cattle. Everyone was running that direction.  Ant and I veiled ourselves in our shadows, they never even saw us.  We set our body temperatures and we walked into Valence's office.  The room felt extremely power heavy.  He was trying to control us.  I dropped my veil I smiled at him and he stared at me in horror.  Ant moved with in the shadows around his back.  Valence pulled a gun and aimed it at me. 

He started to pull the trigger and Ant drew his sword down on his gun hand and it fell to the ground in a clatter.  Valence yowled in pain.  Ant spun quickly and easily and off came his head.  I smiled.  I picked up Valences head and burnt his body.  I carried his dripping head down the hall.  I stood in the middle of their cannery. "Who's next?"  I yelled into the fighting.  All of Valence's men stared up at me, mine continued to fight and took down several more men before Tony yelled for them to Hold.  

All of Valence's men turned their weapons on me.  And that was all that Tony needed before he reached out with is power and they burst into flames.  The urge to vomit overcame me and I let it.  There was little danger now.  The contents of my stomach lay on the ground with the burnt masses of men.  In the distance you could hear cheering.  I could barely make it out.  Ant put his hand on my shoulder, "They shout freedom and Il Cane.  You did right."

I smiled, "We did right.  We all did."

# Where We Are At

When I went to sleep in 2001 I didn't expect any of the things that followed to happen.  I didn't expect to wake up and find myself engulfed in a war that I could have prevented if I'd done my job.  Did I blame myself?  Yes, but I didn't know this would happen.  How could I have?  I did what I felt was right at the time.  It was right at the time.  I was saving Mia, and Ryan and more importantly I was saving Antonio Giovanni's life.  He was much more important than myself.  I loved him.  I know that now.  I loved Mia and Ryan.  And it pains me to think I will never again see Mia's smiling face.  Ryan is hiding his pain, but I know it's there.  I see glimpses of it every time he looks at me.  He blames me for her death.  And I blame myself.  If I'd not removed the Chevalier bond, she'd still be alive.  Hind sight is always 20/20 and there is nothing I can do about it.

I didn't expect many things.  I did not expect to have to kill Johnny Rose or Breeana.  But I did.  I killed my family that had been tortured for twelve years while I'd slept.  I saved them from their miserable existence.  I hurt to do so, but I did it.  

I didn't expect to be betrayed by a lover.  A man I had thought I loved.  A man Tony and I both thought we loved.  But he played us.  He made us love him and I killed him.  Beginning to see a theme here?  I am an assassin by career choice.  I am the hand of death.  Some call me The Hound of Death, others call me just Death.  But it happens that I am no longer dead.  

The irony of it all is I never wished to be anything but what I was.  I was free of the beast inside me.  The fates, the gods, earth, the goddess, whatever you believe in believed I was better off without the vile evil sitting in my head, drawing me towards to the natural evils we have inside us.  I still want to kill.  I still want to bathe in the blood of my victims.  But I am in control.  I no longer have the desire, the need to do so.  

I seem to be the key to many things.  When we stumbled upon a primeval clan of vampires we were taken in.  We became Clan.  And that's where things go really awry.  Through the marriage and joining ceremony of this clan I began more than what I was.  I was reborn, literally.  I breathe, I have a pulse.  I can taste food for the first time in nearly 900 years.  

I wasn't the only one to change my entire blood line has been altered.  We can all walk in the sunlight.  I am still sensitive to the light but it does not burn.  I saw my first sunset and sun rise with my son.  I was able to watch the wonderment in his eyes as he saw them for the first time.  It was a truly amazing blessing.  It has brought me and Ant closer together, not that we were ever far apart but we share new experiences together.  

Morgan and Carissa are growing in their powers by the day.   The Clan tries to teach them, but they seem to surpass their teacher's methods before they even begin.  Their powers are clearly split down the middle.  Carissa is very strong in Auspex.  She has favored, Necromancy, Animal Ken, Domination, and  Fearmonger.  We are not sure exactly why she holds a partial empathic ability, but she clearly has a talent for fear.  Alec has been working with her now that he is with us for the moment.  

Morgan favors Empathy, Shadow, Elemental and Dreamwalking.  I have taken to sleeping with Morgan.  She keeps my nightmares at bay.  They seem to be keeping me company more so than ever.  Everything I've ever done in my past that haunts my thoughts comes to life in my dreams.  I see the many deaths of humans at my hands.  I feel their blood dripping from my chin.  On more nights than I care to count I've woken up with blood dripping from my chin.  But with Morgan at my side, she wards away my dreams, she keeps them away.  When I started having the dreams I worried about Virgil invading my dreams again, but my shields are tight and there are no chinks in them.  Morgan keeps my sleep thoughts happy.  I dream of puppies and sunshine with rainbows.  They are child's wishes and dreams but they are far better than waking up covered in my own blood.

Leyla and Lee are learning from the First Therians.  At first the few Therians I do know thought it was odd I trusted the mangled creatures of the night.  But they can teach them more than I ever could.  And they will learn about their history first hand.  It is a great honor to have some of the First among us.  They may be a blight on mankind, but to us they are our creators.  Without them none of us would be here.

Our greatest task lay ahead of us.  We are gathering allies from all over the world.  Dimitri is traveling the New World gathering Therian allies.  Francesco and Aurora are in the Old World raising an army to save the rest of the world.  Their champion is one of my human blood line.  A child I had given up at birth now holds the Old World in the palm of his hand with my backing.  He doesn't know it yet, but he will soon and together maybe we can free the oppression Brandon Holt has reigned down upon the world.

I have killed one of the five council members who sought my death before I slept.  Sal should have known better than to use his magic on me, but when he realized it, it was too late.  I cut him down like the dog that he was.  I have no love left for those that would enslave human kind.  I should not have been surprised by Sal's reversal of roles.  He had been friends with Brandon long before he became vampire.  Brandon was his sire.  But Aurora denied her sire and she is on my side, sometimes blood is not quite as thick as you'd think it was.  Sometimes the bonds you make outside of your blood are far stronger.

I intend to take down the rest of the council and kill Brandon Holt with his own silver bullets.  I want to see him burn before the people of the world.  I want to hear the cheers of joyous freedom and I want to hear the cries of defeat as I burn him alive.  We have taken down his generals, nothing but the council stand in our way.  The war is almost over.  We either succeed now, or we all die.  There is no other option.  It will be over, and then the world can right itself.  But it will never be the same.  The supernatural are no longer myths and legends.  They are real, and right there in front of the human's eyes.  It will be a very different world, but hopefully much better than the one we live in right now.

# The Stockades

When we went in to kill Valence, Tony had ordered the surrender and the capture of all enemies who had not turned their weapons on me.  Most of those who had surrendered were vampires, they knew much more about me than their human counterparts.  Though we did have a few smart humans, or they had not been in the room I had proclaimed our victory in.  When the enemy guns turned on me he burnt them all alive.  I can still hear their screams and smelt their burning flesh.  The thought of it makes my stomach curl up into a tight ball. 

We held our enemies in what the Clan calls the stockades.  Basically it's a deep dark and damp cave that they have guards on twenty four hours a day seven days a week.  The entrance to the Stockades is barred with necromancy and elemental magic.  Nothing can get in and no one goes in without the circle's consent.  And today, I have that consent.  

It is far easier to make the vampires cow to us, than it is to keep them locked up and withering.  We have tried on prior occasions to coerce them to our side, but most are loyal to their cause.   Today I want to try.  I am Il Cane.  I am the hand of the council.  It means something to them, or they would not have surrendered to us.  It is good to be feared, but respect carries far more weight.

Tony insisted on coming with me, and where Tony went, so did Ryan and Ant.  We were the four musketeers, it was meant as a derogatory notion from members of the Clan.  They believed us weak, and that we were to not be trusted.  But the circle of elders trusted us.  We were outsiders to those who thought that we would never be good enough, not even if we won this war by ourselves.  Which we couldn't do and we know it.  We need allies and we sought them out like a horse to water.

The men guarding the cave bowed at the sight of me.  Being Eldest did have some perks, even though I still would have gotten the same bow.  Even primeval vampires feared Il Cane.

Tony and I dropped the barrier and the four of us stepped inside before the guards raised the magic to keep everyone in.  We would be unable to remove it from the inside.  Inside a magic kept all vampire powers at bay.  It was disconcerting to feel powerless.  I put my hand on my sword for comfort.  Ryan and Ant did the same.  Tony on the other hand grabbed my free hand.  We all had our own comforts.  We walked into the shadowed depths of the cave.

As our eyes adjusted to the darkness we saw pale and shriveling vampires hiding in the darkness.  They all watched as we passed them.  I could feel their eyes on my back as we walked deeper into the stockades.  We walked into the cavern and I felt the bodies behind us press in.  To them at this instance we were food.  The ring of steel echoed in the chamber as the four of us drew our swords.  The sound alone pushed the vampires back.  If there had been any humans in the captured men they were no more.  They'd long since been feed upon and discarded.  Vampires don't feed on vampires.  Dead is dead and vampires cannot feed on the dead.  But we were not dead, we all lived, our hearts beat and our pulses drove the captured enemies crazy. 

Tony spoke in his largest voice he could muster with out magic, his voice carried to the back of the cavern easily, "We come to broker peace."

A low rumble started to rise among the vampires.  But Tony continued, "We offer you your freedom to feed, if you join us.  Swear your fealty to Il Cane and we will let you feed in small droves.  Supervised of course, until you remember what you are and the covenant you broke when signing on with Brandon Holt and Valence Dilanti."

The rumble grew louder.  A voice in the back spoke in a low voice, as if it was painful to speak, "We do not follow the bitch and her human companions.  She is the blight of our existence.  You come to your deaths."

A mass of bodies launched at us. We all moved quickly into a protective formation our back to each other.  We were a well-oiled machine.  We'd trained together, we'd fought together.  We knew how the others reacted.  At least three of us did.  Tony was at a disadvantage, but he was my Chevalier.  He could feel me, he knew me and he trusted me.  He trusted Ryan and Ant we were all a well-oiled machine despite that advantage.

The mass of bodies fell at our feet as we sliced through their bodies with ease.  I felt a sharp pain in my arm as one of them sank their fangs into my flesh. Ryan brought down his sword and the top of the vampires head was sliced in half.  His body clung to my arm.  I shook him off but his fangs were anchored in deeply.  I chopped of the corpses head at the neck.  It still clung to my arm, but a swift swing at another coming vampire and the head flew into the darkness.

We fought, our lives depended on it.  These men had nothing left to live for.  It was an impossible battle for us all.  They thought they were at the advantage.  They had no way out except through us.  But we had no way out either.  They would not drop the barrier for us if we'd made a run for it.  We fought to the death.  The bodies were piling up at our feet, but we were getting tired and there were still more of them coming.  We were injured and tired, I took a deep breath and wished for the courage to do what I was about to do.  I sheathed my swords and I grabbed Tony at my left and Ryan at my right.  I yelled, "Ant."  He sheathed his sword and grabbed Tony and Ryan on the other side. We held their bodies leaving their arms free to fight.  Ant shielded us while I ignited the bodied in front of us.  The fire raged but it did not come in towards us.  The few brave vampires dove through the flames.  They screamed in pain as Tony or Ryan cut them down.  As the fuel in front of us died down the fire died with them.  We could not see anything, but neither could they.  We knew there were more of them but none attacked.  

A woman called out from the shadows, "We yield.  There are only women and children left.  We yield."  

We stood and waited for our eyes to adjust, our ears were strained as we listened for any form of advancement, but nothing came, the woman told the truth.

When I let go of Tony and Ryan the women and the children crawled to us.  "We swear to abide by the covenant or Il Cane will hunt us down and kill us dead."  A chorus of voices followed.  I saw the glow of magic around each woman and child.  I had never seen such a thing I stared in amazement.

Ant said something I didn't hear.  Tony tapped me on the shoulder.  "What's wrong?"

"Their oaths are real."

Tony kissed my cheek, "You are Eldest, this is a place of magic you see the magic as is your right.  Their oaths are binding, and if they break their oath, they will die by that magic."

Tony led me out of the cave, the women and children following us.  Ant and Ryan were bringing up the rear.  We reached the entrance and night had fallen, we'd been in the stockades for nearly eight hours fighting for our lives.  The moonlight showed our bodies splattered with blood and I realized my magic had worked inside the caves.  I looked back and wondered what had happened.  Tony looked at me, "What's wrong?"

"My magic worked.  Ant's worked."  

Ant smiled, "No only yours did.  I pulled from you to shield us."

"Why did mine work?"

Tony laughed, "You are Eldest you command the Clan's magic."

I sighed. I had much to learn still it seemed.  The guards stared at us as we stood behind the barrier covered in drying and dried blood.  "The remaining vampires have sworn their loyalty to the covenant."

The guards dropped the barrier and we walked out.  I felt the fresh air cooling my skin. I had not realized it was so hot inside those caves.  I looked up at the night sky and closed my eyes.  Fresh air had never felt so good.

The women and children were huddled into a mass of weeping bodies.  They were glad to be out of the darkness.  I looked at Tony, "What happens to them now?"

"The circle has provided some temporary camps for them.  We hoped you could talk some sense into them.  It's too bad that most of the fighters died at our hands."  Tony wiped his sword on the dew covered grass.  It only smeared the blood.  He sighed.  "Let's go clean up."

# The Fire

As we were walking back to the village we started to hear shouting, and in the distance smoke rose above the village.  It was another attack, that was my first thought.  We ran in the direction of the village.  But as we got closer we saw that a building was on fire.  Men and women had formed a line and were making an assembly line of water to put out the fire.  It seemed an odd thing to be doing, why someone wasn't using their elemental powers to extinguish the flames was rather odd to me.  Surely someone was strong enough to pull the water from the air.

A young man darted through the crowd wrangling children up.  Tony looked slightly panicked, where were the girls?  I felt for them, and found them but it was not a good place.  I grabbed the young man who was gathering children.  "How many are inside?"

He frowned as he looked up at me, "I don't know."  He looked down, "But I can't find Carissa or Morgan."

I nodded and I looked at the flames.  They were alive, I could feel them panicking.  Tony was walking the length of the building trying to find a place to get by the flames.  There was little time the girls were starting to lose consciousness, I could feel them slipping from me.  I pulled my magic around me and I walked through the flames.  The girls and three other children were huddled in a corner.  There were fallen beams and more fire than I cared for in between us.  The children stared back at me with hope.  I had no other choice, I walked through the flames.  I was careful not to disturb anything, the building was about to crumble.  I felt the heat from the flames felt like it was burning my skin, but my magic protected me.  

I was finally close enough to the children, I grabbed the first child and extended my magic to her, she grabbed Carissa and the chain continued, until all five children were under my protection.  I put the girls hand on the back of my shirt, "Do not let go, for anything.  Everyone hold on."  

The children need a quick way out.  I saw no way to get them out quickly.  I'd have to make my own way.  And pray we were quick enough to get out.  I drew my swords and I focused what magic I could at the wall in front of us.  Morgan lent me her magic and I hardened my blades with earth.  I smashed through the wall and I heard the timbers creak and caught the first in time for the children to scramble past me.  They were out and I held a flaming timber in my hands above my head.  I started to feel the weight grow and the mass of flames engulfing everything above me.  

I wasn't sure what to do next but I had to do something.  I found Tony standing in front of me he grabbed my shirt, "Drop it."  I did as he said and he pulled me from underneath the falling roof before I was crushed underneath it.  Vampire strength and speed was a wonderful thing when it was needed.  

I collapsed on the ground and the girls ran to me and wrapped their arms around me.  Tony knelt in front of us and patted the girls back.  Leyla and Lee came crying into our mass they had been worried about their sisters.

I started to catch glimpses of the conversations behind me.  "She's afraid of nothing."  "Wow. She's good."  "She's stupid, that was stupid."  And every variation of things you could imagine people would say for what I had just done.  I had been stupid, I was afraid but I had no other choice.  

A little boy who I had saved came over to me and hugged me tightly, "Thank you.  You were brave.  I was so scared."

I looked at the little boy, "So was I?"

He laughed like I was lying.  Tony patted the boys back, "She was probably more afraid than you were."  Tony looked at me, "What do you fear most?"

I put my head down, I wasn't embarrassed but it could be used against me in the future, "Fire."

The little boy looked at me, "And you still went in?"

I smiled, "Should I have let you die even though I knew I could save you because I was afraid?"

He thought about it for a minute.  "I'm glad you came for us even though you were afraid."

I smiled at the little boy.  He smiled back, "How come you didn't look afraid?  I know I was."

"The first thing I learned about my powers was how to control my fear, so it could not control me."

"How did you do that?"  He asked curiously.

"You wouldn't like the answer."

"Please tell me.  Tell us."

I sighed, "My sire put me in a coffin and made me believe the coffin was on fire.  And when I'd conquered that fear and knew it was just illusion, he put me in a real burning coffin."

He looked at me horrified, "Why would your father do that?"

"He wasn't my father he was one of my sires.  And he did it to train me, so I could be the best Enforcer I could be, so that no vampire with the power to induce fears could ever hurt me."  It was the harsh truth, one that I had accepted long before I had even become a vampire.  It was the one thing I expected of anyone teaching, to hold no bars to make you the best you can be.  I did not intend to torture my children, I hadn't with Ant, but I would make it possible for them to succeed through the worst of times.

He stared at me.  "You really are The Hound of Death then?"

I nodded, "Yes."

He stared at me longer. I could see him weighing his options in his mind.  Even among the primeval vampire clans I was to be feared.  I was unstoppable by most of their standards.  It is the one reason I trained Ryan and Ant so hard to kill me if the need arose.  Hopefully it never did, but one can never be too safe.  The boy smiled at me, he had come to his decision, "I still want to be just like you."

I smiled, "Hopefully not just like me, be yourself and you will be fine."

He grinned at me and ran off to find his parents.

Donatello was standing above me. I hadn't noticed him with my attention on the boy.  "So Sal locked you in a coffin to teach you to control your fear of fire?"

I nodded.  He smiled, "And you just walked into that real blaze like it was nothing."

I shrugged, "It wasn't nothing.  It was hard, but I had no other option."

He smiled, "If your children had not been in there would you still have gone."

I looked up at him, "Of course.  I would not let another die if I could stop it."

"But you make a living killing people."

I stood up, "I make a living taking care of the vampire nation.  I do as I'm told and I do what is right no matter the cost.  It is my honor, my duty and my obligation."

"And yet you didn't kill Brandon and Valence when you had the chance."  Donatello seemed slightly angry at the past.

I sighed, "I didn't know why they wanted me to kill them. I don't think the council even knew what they were really after.  But I didn't kill them because I thought it was right.  I saved my family.  I saved Tony from dying.  I saved Mia and Ryan from dying.  When honor, duty and obligations from two separate entities clash, what do you do?  You make a decision, you stand by the decision and you do not look back.  I made my decision.  It may not have been the right one for now, but it was the right one then.  I am correcting the problem that is now.  I am here.  I'm doing something about it.  So unless you know something else that I should be doing get off your high horse and let me do it."  I stalked away.  I took a deep breath as I walked into the forest.  No one followed. I could feel their eyes on my back.  I was tired of being blamed for this, it was not my fault.  

# Redemption

I was just so tired of getting the blame.  It wasn't my fault Brandon and Valence wanted to take over the world.  But apparently my life and my actions are what people judge the world by.  Just because Valence was too dangerous to live, I was deemed unworthy of life.  Yes I killed a village when I was given my freedom.  I had not killed a single human soul since that day, except for Johnny, but I embraced him.  I had faked human deaths before when working for the mob, but I did not kill them.  I sent them off to a new life.  They were grateful to me.  But I was sentenced to death because of another's actions.  I hated the council for that.  

I walked until there was no anger left in my heart.  I don't know how long it was, or how far I'd walked.  I'd just walked away.  I turned around and saw nothing but empty plains behind me.  The sun was below the horizon, there were no shadows.   I took a deep breath and I turned around.  I thought about the lives I saved.  About all the supposed good I had done protecting.  But when it all came down to it I was just a murderer.  The council sent me after vampires who they deemed too dangerous.  And I did what they asked without question.  I never took a moral high ground like I had the day they asked me to kill myself.  I was being selfish, and that really was all it boiled down to, that was all people saw.  I was selfish.

I would never find redemption, I would never find salvation. I was going to hell.  No matter what the gods or the earth saw in me, I was a killer.  I dropped to the ground on my knees.  I didn't believe in god or gods or even that the forces out there granted wishes.  I just closed my eyes and curled up on the ground on my knees and forearms.  I just laid there.  I had nothing left in me to move forward.

A little bunny rabbit came up to me and sniffed my hands.  I looked up over my folded hands at the furry little animal.  It stared back at me.  I moved slowly, and I put my hand on the rabbit's furry.  It was silky and soft, it let me pet its fur.  The animal showed no fear.  I was hungry.  I could feel the pulse beneath my hand.  I grabbed the rabbit by the scruff of the neck and lifted it carefully off the ground and sat up.  I carefully cradled it in my arms as I bit softly into the animal's neck.  Animal blood tasted different than human blood did.  It didn't matter what kind of animal it was, it all tasted gamey.  I put the rabbit back on the ground and it looked up at me then scampered off.

At least some thing living trusted me not to kill it.  I smiled.  I got up and I started the walk back again.  I concentrated on one foot in front of the other, it was the only thing I could manage without the overwhelming depression hitting and I gave up again.  

The edge of a forest came into sight; I focused on the trees as they grew larger.  If I could just get there I could walk in the shadows back home.  If I could even call it home.  But it was where my family was.  I could not leave them.  

I finally reached the edge of the tree line and I stepped into the shadows and found Tony sitting at the edge of the village staring into the forest.  He smiled as he saw me step out of the shadows.  It was the last thing I saw before the darkness overwhelmed me and I collapsed.

I woke to the sun streaming into the window.  I was in a soft bed with clean sheets.  I looked around and I barely recognized anything, but I caught movement out of the corner of my eye.  Morgan was peering over the edge of the bed.  I smiled at her, she pounced on me.  "Mommy"

Tony peeked into the room, "You were really hungry, you need to eat more."

I sat up, "So why am I not hungry now?"

"Your three children have been feeding you; they've been sitting with you for the past day."   He frowned, "You okay?"

"I'd probably be still lying in a field if a kind little rabbit hadn't offered itself up to me."  He was still frowning, "You don't mean that do you?"

He shook his head and picked up Morgan, "Go play."  He sat down on the bed next to me, "You left angry.  I wasn't sure you'd come back."

"I only came back for the lot of you."  

He smiled, "Donatello wanted to send a search party after you.  He wanted to lead it.  He wanted to be the first to apologize.  I wouldn't let them.  I knew you'd come back but it didn't stop me from worrying."  He looked embarrassed by that admission.

I put my hand under his chin and made me look up at me, "I've given you reason to worry.  I worry about myself.  I don't think people understand that I blame myself more than they ever do."  I felt tears well up in my eyes.  I looked away from Tony.  He pulled me into his lap.  "If I'd done my job, Sierra and China might be alive.  I wouldn't have had to kill Johnny or my family.  Mia and Damian wouldn't be dead."

Tony held me tightly to him, "You are right, it's not your fault.  And I'm sorry you blame yourself."

A knock came from the door frame.  Tony whispered to me, "You've a visitor."

I turned to look at the figure standing in the doorway.  It was Donatello.  "You worried us.  But most importantly I'm sorry.  I wasn't implying anything, I was trying to understand.  I didn't realize that you had been blamed for this disaster.  Your consort told me what had happened.  He also told us how you felt."  He put his hand on the top of my head, "But child, you do not have to worry about the things you've done in the past, we accept you and who you are.  Or we should.  You don't have to walk away from us."

I looked up at him, "I didn't walk away for you. I walked away before I killed someone."  He pulled his hand back like I'd snapped at him.  He frowned at me then put his hand back on my head, "Sometimes you frighten me I cannot help my reaction."

Tony laughed, "She knows, she's use to it. There is no offense in your reaction."

I nodded, "I know I'm not the kindest person and I come off as unloving and uncaring."

Donatello smiled, "But you have a very large heart."

# The Plan

Apologize were never very easy to accept but there really was more important things to do than sit around a mope about.  I pulled myself out of the comfortable bed.  It was harder than it looked, the feather mattress was a bit too squishy for my tastes, but it would do in a pinch.  We definitely had better things to do than sit around doing nothing.  I sat on the edge of the bed, "We have a few things to discuss and to take care of."

Donatello laughed, "And right back to business.  I'll gather the circle and we can start when you are ready."

I nodded, "I need Ant and Ryan included as well as anyone who was at the compound outside Dangdburgh, we need details we probably don't have right now."

Donatello nodded and looked at Tony, "You know that better than I do.  One hour?"  Tony nodded and Donatello left us alone.

Tony turned to me, "I guess I should go too, find those bodies you need."  He smiled as he grabbed my hands and pulled me to my feet.  "Eat real food and some blood and then you can leave the house.  Meelah will not let you leave if you don't abide by her rules."

I smiled and nodded, "If you insist."  Tony kissed me softly then left to go hunt down anyone he could that knew anything about the compound he had called home for many years.  We needed a layout; we needed obstacles that may be present.  We needed more than we had if we were going to navigate through the catacombs and retrieve the lost artifacts.  I wasn't looking forward to entering the Church of the Damned, but it had to be done.  I only hoped that the way would be clear to the compound.

I got up from the bed and walked into the other room to find Meelah had set a table full of food.  "Eat." she commanded me.

I nodded.  "Yes, ma'am."  I sat down at the table and stared at the offerings.  I had no idea where to start.  Morgan and Carissa helped me.  Carrissa took a big scoop of something and plopped it on the plate in front of me.  Morgan poured a sauce over the top of it.  Carissa smiled, "Mashed potatoes and gravy."  

Morgan dropped a piece of meat on my plate.  I frowned at her, I knew what that was.  "No.  I won't eat that."  

She looked up at me, "But Nana's roast is good."

I smiled, "I don't eat meat, any meat."

Carissa smiled, "Just try it."

I shook my head.  "No."

Meelah looked at me, "Something wrong with my cooking?"

I smiled, "No ma'am, I have not eaten meat since I was 5 years old."

Meelah's mouth formed a surprised O as she realized why.  "I will remember that child."  She took Morgan by the hand, "Your Mommy is a vegetarian she doesn't eat meat."

Morgan nodded and took the roast from my plate and stuffed it in her mouth.  I smiled at her.  "Thank you."

Carissa and Morgan heaped vegetables and fruit on to my plate, there was little room for anything else.  Meelah smiled, "I'll insure there is other protein next time."

I nodded, "Thank you."

I tried everything the girls had offered me.  I had carrots and peas, they were all too mushy for my taste, but I ate them.  I did like the mashed potatoes, though I think the gravy was a meat base and I could feel my stomach churning from the flavor.  I ate everything they provided me.  Meelah was satisfied, "And a bit to wash it down with?"

"Tony won't let me out without it, so yes."  

Meelah smiled broadly.  "Sam is waiting for you outside."

I picked up the girls and sat them in my lap.  "Thank you.  Now you be good for Meelah, And Morgan, no more playing with fire."

She looked at me ashamed, "How did you know it was me?"

I smiled, "I just know.  No more elemental from anyone but me, understand?"  I looked to Meelah, "Can you insure that the teachers know that?"

Meelah nodded.  "I can child.  She will not touch it again.  I think she's a bit afraid to."

"We'll fix that but not right now."  I set the girls down with a big hug.  "I have to go get some things back safely before the enemy finds them."

Sam was waiting outside; he greeted me with a bright smile.  "Still hungry?"

I laughed, "Not really, but if I don't they'll know and I'll be in trouble."

He grinned and offered his wrist.  I bit into his wrist and drank the coppery liquid.  It tasted far more wonderful than I'd remembered.  I forced myself to stop.  Sam laughed, "You need more after eating.  You are one weird vampire Cari.  I'm not sure any one person can satisfy your hunger."  

I smiled, "You'll just have to do.  We have things to do."  

He nodded, "Tony told me to get one of the other vampires to escort me and Andrew to some of the other conclaves and clans out there to see if we can get you the details you want without raising too much suspicion.  That cool?"

"If that's what he wants you to do."  

"I'm yours not his.  I had to ask."

I laughed, "For future reference, if Tony, Ant or Ryan ask you to do something you can assume I agreed.  I won't be mad at you for doing what they ask. " I smiled evilly, "I might take it out of their hide, but not yours."

He grinned, "Okay.  I'll keep that in mind and let the others know.  See ya Cari."

I watched Sam leave before he disappeared down the hill.  I turned to head towards the meeting room.  I knew what we needed to do, but I didn't know how dangerous it was going to be.  Getting into the Church of the Damned was going to be dangerous enough as it was.  I just hoped we could get in.

In the meeting room most of the circle stood around a large piece of paper.  Tony and Ant looked up at me.  "We got a basic structure down, you need more?"

"Not right now, we'll see what else we need."

Ant turned the paper to face me, "This is what we remember before all the destruction.  What's still there we don't know."

I nodded, "Yeah I know.  Where were you keeping the artifacts you took from my vaults?"

Tony marked a red X in a room that was not going to be easy to reach.  

"North is at the top?"

Ant and Tony looked at each other Tony turned the map in one direction and put a N at the top.  "That's North I think."

I smiled, "It's important to know the direction."

He nodded, "I'm pretty sure it is."

I asked the room in general, "Do we have a map of Dangdburgh?"

Tony asked, "Yeah, why?"

"Need that too."

He nodded, "Yeah I got that why?"

"Cause we are going back there."

Ant interrupted, "Cari, that's dangerous to do.  Brandon's going to have a lot of his people there waiting for us to show up again."

I nodded, "I know.  But there are only three other ways into those catacombs I know of - one at Frozen, one at my estate, and one at the Church of the Damned."

Ant and Tony frowned.  Tony was the first to speak though, "There is no Church of the Damned."

I smiled, "Not on the map officially.  It's called Dangdburgh's Roman Catholic Church."

"Why did you call it the Church of the Damned then?"

"Because that's what it is underneath, once before Dangdburgh was populated with more humans, a cult of human's worshiped vampires there.  The Roman Catholic's claimed it and supposedly cleansed it.  But the secrets still lie under it.  We have to get in and it is the easiest way to do so.  I doubt Brandon has anyone waiting there for us."

Donatello interceded, "But no vampire can enter sacred ground."

I smiled, "I can.  You have to trust me.  I can get us in."

# The Church Of The Damned

We probably were as ready as we'd ever be.  I still wasn't looking forward to the Church of the Damned.  It had been several centuries since I had last been there.  The protective wards were dangerous to even those who knew about them.  The hardest part was probably going to be to convince those going with me that they could actually walk on sacred ground.  Beliefs were a very hard thing to break, but if no magic was present it was breakable.

Tony decided it was best to go under the cover of night.  Not that it mattered either way, but breaking and entering in the middle of the night was easier to get away with, though I had my doubts about it.  We would see once we got there.

We walked to shadows outside of the city of Dangdburgh; we didn't know what traps might lay in the city itself.  The areas outside the compound had been abandoned for a few months now.   The ground was charred but the smell had vanished.  It was really too bad that we couldn't get into the compound, we were so close to the entrance now.  But it had collapsed with many of the tunnels because of the bombing Brandon and Valence set their men upon the revolt against their New Order.  It would have been so simple.  But what keeps us out, keeps them out too. 

Tony turned to the men behind us.  "You all go check the entrances to the compound.  Maybe we'll get lucky."  The men saluted and they headed off behind us.  We doubted they would find anything, but we can't be absolutely sure, so we checked.  That left me, Tony, Ant, Ryan and three other, one vampire and two Therians to go into the city and find the Church of the Damned and hope we could get through the catacombs that way.  It also was a long shot with all the bombing, but it was our only way in without excavating the compound.  The only other way in was through enemy territory, and that was not going to work for most of us.  I had my reservations and I knew my estate better than anyone else, but no one wanted to risk it.

The city use to bustle at night.  It was home to many vampires before the war.  Now it seemed that it was a ghost town, nothing moved, there were no sounds.    While that fact made it easier to get around, it also made it harder.  If we were spotted it would most likely be by an enemy and we'd be fighting our through the city.  We stayed in the shadows of the buildings as we walked the deserted streets of the city.  There was devastation everywhere.  This was once a home for peaceful existence, but now it was a reminder of the destruction vampires could do on humans around the world.  Dangdburgh was not the only city where vampires lived in harmony.  In fact most cities around the world housed vampires.  And the humans never even knew their existence.  

Life after this was going to be dangerous.  Humans were not tolerant souls. My biggest fear is the genocide of vampires by the remnants of these survives.  Vampires were a danger.  Even if it was vampires that would save them, I feared the worst.

Everyone but me seemed to be on their toes.  I was not afraid of what lie on the streets.  I was afraid of what we would find in the Church.  As my own thoughts drifted to the dangers we'd find hiding in the darkness the Roman Catholic Church came into view over the tree tops.  I took a deep breath and hoped being alive was not going to hinder our passage.

The church was like any other Roman Catholic you would find anywhere in the world.  Its steeples jutted high into the sky and the architecture was grand.  It was a beautify building, and one of few that had remained untouched by the ravaging of the city.  

Ryan, Ant and Tony started to walk through the gates.  I held my arms in front of them to stop them.  It was the last thing we needed was to have my family burnt to a crisp for not paying attention.  "Traps."

Tony and Ant held out their hands to feel for the wards to be triggered, but they found none. I spoke softly, "They are veiled."

Ryan looked at me, "You put them there?"

I nodded, "Only humans may pass unhindered."

Ryan went to take a step and I grabbed his arm.  "You are Chevalier let's not take the risk."

He smiled and nodded his thanks.  The three men behind me had our backs, but I could tell they were afraid.  Fear was good, as long as it didn't make you cower.  I hoped these men were not cowards.

I unveiled the wards and Tony and Ant pulled their hands away in surprise.  It was like setting a blaze suddenly.  I undid the ward and everyone but Tony and the other vampire walked across the threshold to the church.  Sacred ground would be hard to break if you believed it was sacred.  Tony and all primeval vampires were raised to believe in whatever religion the masses did.  And sometimes those beliefs carried over into their myths and legends of ire to swat disbelief.  I looked at Tony and smiled.  "Do you trust me?"

He nodded.  "Then believe in me.  Not the church, the gods. Believe in me and I will get you through this."  Tony took a step forward and he did not burst into flames.  He truly believed I would not lead him astray.  I couldn't say the same for the other.  Belief was strong, and if you believed hard enough myth became real when it came to the old magic.  And primeval magic was one of the oldest kinds in the world.  The vampire accompanying us believed he would be struck down by a bolt from the heavens if he trespassed on sacred grounds.  His belief became reality.  But it wasn't a bolt from heaven, his own magic turned against him and he electrocuted himself.  I sighed and turned toward the entrance of the church.

One of the Therians with us,  "Just like that you can turn away."

I sighed, "We must move forward.  If you feel the need to deal with his corpse now then so be it, but we must move on now."  I turned and raised my hand the body started to burn, and in wit in moments in was nothing but a pile of ash.  I looked to Ant, "A bit of wind?  Clear our tracks."

He smiled and produced a gentle breeze from his hands to scatter the ash from the threshold of the church.  "I can't lay the wards again, it will drain too much and we need the power we all have to get through this."

Ryan asked, "Are we taking everything?"

I shook my head.  "No, I have secondary measures in place to insure the safety of the cache once we get there.  We can't take it all.  One day we can come back and excavate it all and make it safe again."

They let me take the lead.  They didn't want to fry their own selves.  I was glad to take point.  The entrance to the church was going to be the most difficult to get past.  It relied on someone on the inside.  I clanged the knocker in a specific pattern.  Three quick raps followed by two long.  I hoped the years were good to the priests inside.  I only hoped their predecessors passed on the information.

An elderly man pulled open the doors.  They seemed a might heavy for the frail man before us be he opened the doors effortlessly.  He looked at the people behind me then looked down at me.  "I thought you'd be taller."

Ryan and Ant laughed behind me.  I shook my head. They were always being silly at the worst of times.  I just waited for him to ask what he was supposed to ask.  He stared at me in confusion.  "Oh, yes.  I remember now.  I am lighter than a feather, yet no man can hold me for very long. What am I?"

"A breathe."  The veil shimmered in front of us.

The man asked the next question, wonderment in his eyes, "Feed me and I live, give me something to drink and I'll die. What am I?"

"A fire."  The ground shook below us.

"The more you have of it, the less you see. What is it?"

"Darkness."  The veil dropped and the ward was exposed.  I could feel the necromancy radiating from the threshold of the door.

"Until I am measured I am not known, yet how you miss me when I have flown."

"Time."  The wind screamed as the latch of the ward was found.

The last question came, "It is greater than God and more evil than the devil. The poor have it, the rich need it and if you eat it you'll die. What is it?"

"Nothing."  The ward popped and then there was nothing barring our way.

The man looked at me in awe.  "I never knew what that would do."

I smiled, "May we enter?"

He moved from the front of the door.  "Of course.  I am but a humble servant of God."

To each his own, I fought the urge to say it out loud.  The Church was marble and gilded everywhere you looked.  It was a rich church.  The stained glass windows depicted scenes from the bible and the pews were made of mahogany.  A very rich church, thanks to my donations.  It was a small price to keep the artifacts safe.

# The Catacombs

We went into the depths of the Church.   The sanctuary and used portions of the church were just as the entry way had been.  Everything was polished and shined in the dim lights.   I opened the door labeled study.  The elderly priest protested, "Only I may enter here."

I turned back at the man and glared at him.  He hopped and bowed and scraped as if I'd said something sharp.  Ryan bit back a giggle.  Tony put his hand on my shoulder and Ant carefully ushered the man away from us.  He spoke to the priest in hushed tones.

I turned back to the door and it creaked from ill use.  The room behind was dark and dusty.  The dust on the floor showed no recent signs of movement through its four walls.  I smiled.  It was a good thing.  I stepped inside, "Stay here while I find it."

It wasn't that I didn't want them to see, the room was too small for all of us to fit and do what needed to be done.  I held out my hand and felt for my magic.  It was easier than trying to remember exactly what I had done.  As with most of the traps at this point they were veiled and warded.  When I found was I was looking for I was not shocked to see the ancient statue had been broken.  The Roman church had destroyed it, but the piece itself would not budge from the shelf it had stood on.  It was after all part of the wall.  It was the lever that would open the catacombs if the wards were lifted.  There were few people who wanted to move the statue, breaking its ugly figure had been enough.

I removed the veil and the ward.  It was not a simple task, but it was a necessary one.  Tony poked his head in, "Everything alright?"

I nodded.  "It's a complicated ward."

Tony stood in the doorway.  "You make it?"

I shook my head, "No, and Yes.  I helped to create it.  One of Thea's grandmother's helped place it."

I looked at him, he felt concerned in my head, "I can undo it.  It'll just take more time."  He didn't look relieved.  

Ryan pulled on Tony's arm, "Let her work.  She's undone their magic before."  He nodded and they moved into the church, only to be replaced by Ant.

I returned to the complicated spell that I had not fully completed.  It took patience to unravel what I had done, so that the entire thing would fold on itself, hopefully without a bang.

I could feel Ant's eyes on me he was watching what I was doing with learning eyes.  I turned and smiled at him.  He grinned back.  "I see the end.  Almost done."

I nodded, "Good.  Care to finish?"

He looked at me with a childhood glee I had not seen in many years on my son's face.  He nodded emphatically and moved around me to finish the work.  I put a shield around both of us while he worked, just in case of a bang.  I called out to the others.  "You might want to be away from this area a bit more, just in case."

The priest questioned me as he poked his head into the room.  "In case..."  And the ward dropped with a large pop.  I shook my head from the pressure of the sound.  It had not been loud, but it released enough pressure to knock the man back who had been standing in the door way.

"In case of that or worse."  I pulled the broken statue and bookshelf swung open.  Ant and I had to step out of the room for it to finish its arc.

The three other men were setting up camp to watch the door as we went in.  "You can't stay here.  We'll be separated; we aren't coming back this way.  You either come all the way with us, or you go find the others."

They stared back at me, only one had the courage to tell me, "Our orders were to watch your back."

I smiled, "Then you need to stay with us.  This will not be a problem."

"We have our orders, my may be Eldest, but we were ordered by the Vicar to stand outside and guard you."

I sighed, "Fine, you can wait here until we come back."

"And that will be when?"  He asked.

I stepped through the doorway, "Never."

Ryan and Ant laughed, Tony sighed, "Do what you want men, but the Vicar does not know what she plans to do to protect the relics.  This building may not stand when she is done."  And he followed us through.

At this point I didn't care if they followed or not.  They could stay the cowards that they were.  But I heard them enter the darkness and one of them pulled the door closed behind him.  I heard one mumbled to another, "It'll be safer with her than without her."  I was glad to see they'd not been fools or cowards.

The passage was dark, and damp unlike the room we had just been in.  Our footsteps echoed down the long passages.   At first the passage was man made, each brick laid precisely.  You could see the varying techniques as things got older.  Eventually the tile ran out and the ground and the walls were natural rock.  You could hear a faint drip of water off in the distant cave.  I could feel everyone's tension, everyone was wary of what was around the next bend.  

We walked for nearly an hour before we came to our first ward.  Ant easily brought the ward down.  He smiled happily as he'd stepped past.  He was a fast learner, but he was also only dealing with vampire magic this far down.  Ant felt for the next ward in front of him, "Don't take it down."  I cautioned him.  He nodded as he felt it a few yards down the length of the passage. He stopped in front of it and waited for me.

I pointed to an alcove, "Everyone over there, move along the wall and wait over there."  I pointed to the other side of the passage.  "This ward will not come down.  It needs to remain intact."

They all skirted the edge like I instructed and waited.  When they were all clear I pulled my shields around me and I stepped through the ward.  Fire enshrouded me as I walked through the ward.  I could feel the magic pulsing against my shields.  It was almost too powerful, and then it was done as I crossed the invisible line.  I reached around the veil and stepped into it.  I would have disappeared from my comrade's view.  There were many things in the tiny alcove.  Most of which were not helpful.  I grabbed the leather straps jumbled in a pile on one shelf, the handful of metallic rods from another and placed them in my pockets.  I scanned the bindings of the leather bound tomes searching for one book in particular.  When I found it I pulled the backpack off my back and placed it carefully inside, then shut it quickly.  I grabbed the two medallions on the bottom shelf and a few stones that looked to be nothing.  I put them in my pockets.   

I stepped out of the veil and what I saw was not what I was expecting.

My men were facing off against Nate and his men.  Nate glared at me.  I could feel his power beneath his skin.  I reached in my pocket and flung one of the medallions at Ryan.  He caught it with a smile.  He knew what it was he'd helped me make it.  Nate's people were standing in the perfect spot.  I smiled at Nate.

"Well, well, look what we have here, a doggy in the middle."

"Ant, do you see it?"  I asked hoping he'd know what I meant.  

He laughed, "Yeah. But I don't know what to do."

I smiled.  "You fire then I'll do it."

He smiled.  "I can handle that."

I reached up my hands to the ceiling and sent my power flying to the ceiling above.  Ant flung his hands in front of him and flames shot down the hallway.  Nate had been expecting something and he laughed as the flames went around him.  His people were not so lucky they started to scream in pain and running in the opposite direction.   I pulled my hands down pulling the magical wedges in the roof I had placed. I pulled with all my strength and the ceiling crumbled to the floor in a loud crash behind Nate.  He turned to see that his people were either on fire or crushed.

Nate had a temper much like his powers he rushed me in anger, right into the ward.  He hadn't thought to keep his shields up once Ant had finished his flame throw.  His body burnt mere feet in front of me.  I chocked back the nausea as I brought my shields back around me and stepped towards my people.    We nearly ran to the bend to escape the flaming screams and the sizzling of flesh and bone.

But we had to stop, the rest must be collapsed.  Ant smiled at me and reached to the ceiling.  Tony reached as well, he was not as strong in elements but he could do it.  I reached with them and the three of us brought down the roof systematically burying the artifacts beneath their rubble.  The cavern started to crumble in front of us. 

We ran down the corridor until we found our first route to the east.  We would have to keep going east to get to the compound.  The cave in had subsided and the remaining corridors should be sound, we only hoped we could find our way to the compound with the damage from the bombings and what we had just done.  We could only hope to find a way through.

# The Shrine

We continued to the east whenever we could.  We hadn't found any damaged areas yet, but we had no idea how far we had gone in the right direction either, the way had been very twisty-turny up to this point.  But the catacombs were starting to look familiar to me.  Not compound familiar but familiar from a time centuries ago when I explored the caverns below the city.  

The walls had a faint glow to them.  It wasn't enough to brighten the way but it was there if you looked hard enough.  The walls were etched with ancient symbols and pictogram.  Ant stopped to exam some while we all walked through the corridors.  I watched as he traced one symbol as if he'd seen it before but couldn't remember.  I put my hand on his shoulder with an encouraging push to not linger long.  I had only seen these symbols in one other place.  I was surprised that Tony had not stopped to look at them.  Maybe he didn't see the magic as Ant and I did.  Ryan and Tony were very focused on the darkness.

They stopped in front of us and Ant and I nearly ran them over, stopping on their heels.  I peered into the room and saw what they stared at.  A large monolithic idol stood in the center of a large cavern.  The magically glow here was obvious and the cavern was very well lit.  I was amazed that it still stood, perhaps even the New Order feared the First.  Tony stared, he knew what it was.  I could feel the fear in his mind you could see his muscles tremble as he dared not step into the light.  

Ant was curious and he stepped into the room.  Tony had tried to grab him but in his attempt to grab his son and stay out of the room he lost his balance and stumbled into the light of the room.  The other three stood behind us and stared the vampires knew what it was.  They knew their rituals as did Tony.  

There was no time between Tony stumbling and when he grabbed my wrist and forcefully threw me against the shrine.  The magic bound my wrists.  Ant and Ryan started to come to my rescue, but I shook my head.  I hadn't been certain but I thought we might come upon this fertility shrine.  

Back in the day, the First used this as their marriage ceremony, the first consecration of the marriage and the procreation of their race.  Today it was pretty much forgotten, but the magic was still strong.  I could feel it pressing down on us.  I was here willingly, the power flowed through me, I could imagine the fight in Tony's mind and body.  He hadn't been prepared for this eventuality, was it cruel not to tell him of ifs and maybes?  At the time I had thought no, but now looking at the pain in his eyes at hurting me I think I was in the wrong then.  I smiled at him to reassure him and the confusion and pain turned to anger.  

The anger ripped through his body and took control.  The magic fueled his already strong empathy.  What could have been a pleasurable exercise in the marital bliss, but his anger made it something more primal.  My clothes did not make the transition.  And I was sore from the force of the encounter.  But the magic and the pain of pleasure more than made up for the assault on my body.  Tony on the other hand collapsed to the ground in exhaustion.  I felt the power leave us a gift.  Tony looked up at me with sadness, joy and concern all in one look as he felt the conception of our next child - a son from the feeling the First magic gave us both.  I smiled at him and the magic release my wrists.

I knelt down in front of Tony and put my hands on his face.  He didn't know whether to be mad at me or to welcome the new chance to raise our children.  Twice we had failed in the process.  Maybe this time it would be different.  Ant, Morgan and Carissa were of us, but Ant I had raised without Tony, and the girls had grown for five years a sleep with me.  There was no raising the baby to become toddler to young child for them.  They just were.  This was a third chance to be the parents we could be together.

I leaned in and whispered in Tony's ear, "It's okay.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you.  We will make this work."

He grabbed my hands and pulled me closer to him, he was still angry and he was hurting my wrists.  He pushed me back to the ground and lay on top of me.  "Is this your idea of fun?"

I shook my head.  "They why didn't you tell me?"

"Should I tell you every if and maybe we might run across?  The First magic moves, I don't know where it will be."  I tried to push Tony off of me, but it was like moving a mountain.  "I didn't even know if it would work.  I am not one of you."

Tony pushed my wrists harder into the ground. I fought back the moan of pleasure at his rough treatment.  He glared at me and pushed harder, "You are now.  You were reborn."

I fought against Tony but it did little good, "I was born human, I died human.  I was reborn but I will always be human at my core."

Tony stared down at me.  We stared at each other.  I tried to get up again but Tony pushed me back down.  He kissed me forcefully but I let his passion flow into me.  The room began to glow, the First magic was back and it was entering our bodies again.  Tony pushed himself inside of me and let my arms go so I could wrap myself around him.  He started to be rough, but he eased down and we made passionate love.  The first magic flowed in us we could feel its power enhancing our love making.  I felt the magic split the embryo inside me.  I shuttered and we climaxed together and the child that the magic had made had given us identical twin boys.  We both collapsed in exhaustion, the magic lingered but no longer rode our passion.  

I saw images in my mind the magic was speaking to me.  It wanted me to do something.  Images of a young man in a diner waiting,  I nodded my assent, I would do as it asked, but I really had no idea what it wanted from me.  It gave me the feeling that I would know when I knew.  Vague answers always sucked.  The magic lingered with me but did not take part anymore, it was happy to stay with me.

But the events were not over, Tony stood above me naked in all his glory and he was angry.  "Why do you do this to me?"

I asked, "Do what?"

"You manipulate me.  You make me do things I don't want to do.  You've always done it."

I just stared at him in wonder.  I saw Ant and Ryan from the corner of my eye, they stayed away, but they watched for malintent.

"I don't manipulate you."

"Then your magic does without your consent."  Tony picked up his sword from the ground and pulled it from it's sheath.  Anger filled his eyes.  The storm of his anger was coming.

Ant stepped between us facing me, "Don't kill him, Cari.  He's my father.  We need him.  I need him."

Tony pushed Ant out of the way, "I don't need a boy protecting me.  I can defend my own self."

Ant shrugged as he picked himself up off the ground, "Have it your way."

There was little time between Ant starting his sentence to Tony's sword piercing my abdomen.  I saw it all happen.  I didn't react.  I felt his silver blade cleave the embryos inside of me.  I felt the blood gush into my womb.  The inhuman cells of the children tried to survive, but I felt their lights flicker from existence as I dropped to my knees with a sword piercing my body from front to back.

I looked up at Tony and there was fear in his eyes.  I pulled his sword out and threw it to the ground beside me.  I collapsed to the ground and there was nothing but the dark inside my mind to comfort me.

# The Compound

I was out for a few hours as my body healed.  I woke to find Ryan and Ant hovering over me.  Tony and the others had fled to the safety of the clan.  We were left alone to do what needed to be done.  There was no salvaging what was between Tony and I.  There was nothing left of us.  But that was a thing for another time.  I looked up at the two men who were the one constant in my life and nodded, "Let's go.  We have a job to do."

We had to keep going east.  I think we wound up going in circles a couple times.  Ryan started making scratches along the wall with his knife so we could keep track of things.  And we had gone in circles at least once. We had to try west for a while.  It dashed our hopes a little that we'd actually find a way into the compound from the city itself that was not blocked.

We could have walked for days if it were not for Ryan.  The catacombs were huge under the city, larger than even I had explored so many years ago.  I felt the gentle hum of magic in front of us.  It was a dead end, everyone had already turned around, but I knew what this was.  A man names Josh had helped me set it up.  I felt for the wards and found them.  I smiled then called back behind me, "We are here."

The three still with us stared at me like I was insane.  I didn't care they were minor in comparison to what my friends meant.  They stared at me and waited.  Ant watched me as I pulled the ward down.  He smiled as he reached up and pulled the sheet down.  He remembered what I had done that day back with Josh.  He grinned at me happily.  We had found the compound.  But how much of it was left.  If we were lucky maybe the artifacts were not buried if they were we'd have to come back one day and rescue them.  But they would be safe until then, if we could only find them.

We spread out.  We all went there own separate ways.   We had a large compound to explore and it would be quicker to do this way.

I wandered the halls kicking in doors looking for things that might be useful or survivors.  We had only one goal in mind, but you never know what else might come in handy.

Room after room led to nothing.  I found nothing.  The walls and ceilings had fallen in several corridors and I had to back track to find another way around.  I walked around for a while with no results.  

I started to recognize some of the landscape of the halls.  Memories flooded my mind, the girls clung to me.  I walked in front of Tony I could feel his eyes on my back as he watched me.  I walked carefully through the corridor and found a door already open.  I stepped in and saw the small bed they had wheeled into the room with me and the girls on it.  

I started to feel that nagging feeling that someone wanted me, Ant was calling to me. 

I made my way through the corridors towards Ant, searching as I went.  There was no point to not cover as much ground as we could.  

I found Ant and Ryan standing in the middle of what had been the conference room.  Maps were scattered everywhere, rocks had fallen onto the table leaving it a massive wreck.  But in the corner the artifacts lay unharmed.  I scanned the area for magic and found only Aurora's unique signature.  "Look for veils for anything else hiding."

Ant looked, but they weren't going to find anything Aurora might have hidden.  "I will look, you start packing the items carefully."

Ryan hadn't waited for instruction he had already started picking up items and carefully packing them in his backpack.  The other three started to help him.  "I guess we could just shadow walk to the rendezvous spot."

Ant smiled, "That's probably best since we don't know if there is any other way out except through the estate or Frozen."

"There is nothing else hidden.  We can go once we get these packed up."  I looked to Ant and Ryan, "There are no other stashes are there?"

They shook their head, "No, Aurora kept everything here she had taken."

I nodded and grumbled.  Ryan laughed, "Still sore about that huh?"

I smiled, "They should not have been moved."

"We were looking for all the help we could get."  Ryan defended Aurora with venom.

I sighed and let it be.  I was tired of this fight.  I was tired of being blamed for this damned war.

We packed up all the artifacts and we gathered outside in the hall then we stepped into the shadows to go home.

# The Caestus

We returned with the artifacts and new buzz started in the village.  What did we bring back?  What does it do?  I really hoped they never found out.  All the items except those Ryan held were taken to the circle's meeting room.  Deja Vu all over again, another government trying to learn from the things that should not have been taken out.  I took the book from Ryan's bag and placed it carefully in a room under a veil.  It was not a book I was willing to part with.  It was my own personal notes and research.  Not a journal, but notes on what I had learned over the centuries studying the items.   And when I was done I locked it away with the most dangerous of things.  I didn't want anyone getting their hands on it.  But we needed the information. I didn't want to screw my own plans up by forgetting something.

The metal rods didn't clang in my pockets thankfully no one really remembered me putting them there.  The leather cords were not really of a magical sort, just an element to make something I intended to share.  I only hoped that the circle would let me hide the remainder of the secrets.  Nothing was meant to be used.  They were too dangerous to use and more dangerous to destroy.

When I got into the meeting room packs were being opened and the room was buzzing with questions and they were exploring things haphazardly.  I spoke quietly.  "Do Not Touch Anything."

The men and women in the room stared at me in shock.  I glared back at them.  "These things are not for you to use.  They are to be restored into their vaults.  They are not your answers."

Everyone including Donatello stammered their excuses.  "No."  I stretched out my powers and I shielded and veiled the items from view.  No one would touch or see the items that Aurora had found.  "No one is to use them."

A man I did not know his name stepped in front of me and loomed over me trying to make me cower.  He yelled at me, "You have no right, Mongrel.  You are not Clan no matter what the magic says."

I laughed.  "I have every right.  I was their Keeper before and I am their Keeper now.  I was entrusted with their safety.  Not you, not this clan, not even your bloodline.  I WAS.  If anyone has a claim to be Keeper of Secrets I will gladly hand it over if you can find the items."

That made people leap and scramble for the items they knew were there.  But they weren't.  The good thing about shields and veils and being powerful in Shadow was that you could easily move items through the shadows without stepping yourself.  

Donatello smiled at me from across the room.  "Well played.  I trust you'll care for them."

I nodded, "I do have a secret I will share with you, but I have to prepare first."

Donatello nodded, "I figured you would offer something for our efforts."

I glared back at him.  They had done nothing.  I turned and left the room while the circle clamored over themselves trying to find the artifacts.

I went back to where I had stashed the book and pulled it out of its hiding.  I sat down at the Meelah's kitchen table with the large leather bound book.  Ryan and Ant stood behind me as if they were shielding me from prying eyes, but I know they were both curious as to what I had.  

Ant asked, "What's this?"

"It's my notes on the things I studied in the vaults.  It is the only thing that I will let others read.  It has no magic in and of itself.  You or the rest of the circle cannot do most of these as the actual rituals are in my head or in the original books.  Think of this like a catalog."

Ryan smiled and then frowned, "Jack would have loved putting this into the modern age for you."

I nodded, "He would have.  Maybe if things get put back together we can find someone to do so in his memory."

Ryan laughed, "The Jackapedia."

Ant laughed their joke was mostly lost on me.

Ryan tried to explain the Wikipedia website and the internet and I just ignored his technobabble.  I really wasn't interested.  "One day I'll get you on the computer."

Ant shook his head, "I doubt that.  I can't get her to use a firearm, and they've been around much longer than the internet."

Ryan smiled, "Yeah, but a gun doesn't let her get up and personal with her marks.  That's why she won't use one.  I bet you she's better at it than you, me, Tony or any other sniper you find.  The internet is useful I bet I can get her to use it when things are normal again."

Ant held out his hand, "I'll take both bets."  They shook on it.  Ant leaned down and spoke in my ear, "You willing to shoot a gun for me?"

I turned and looked up at him with a smile, "If we get to work now."

He took a step back in shock, "Seriously you'll shoot a gun for me?"

"If we get to work now."

He nodded.  "So what are you looking for?"

I pulled a cord from around my neck that held two small discs of metal and held them up.  "The Caestus creation information."

Ant pulled his from around his neck and Ryan pulled his set out of his pocket.  Ryan's were different they held a gem in the center.

We flipped through the book in my hand writing.  The text was small and fading but it was still readable.  Ryan put his finger on one page.  "Here."

I pulled the tome closer and started reading my notes.  It was a quick read, and all I needed was a forge. "Just need a forge.  I have a limited supply of metal."  I pulled the metal rods out and placed them in the middle of the book.  I handed Tony one.  "This is for the circle to study.  One is for you.  Two I am holding in reserve, it's a feeling I have.  Six saved for the children.  The remaining 10 are for the circle to determine their use.  They are bound to a specific vampire and cannot be shared."

I got up and smiled, "Meelah can you gather the circle outside near the fire, and I will share."

She nodded and did what I asked of her without question. 

Ant and Ryan grabbed a few of the leather cords on the table and I did the same.  Caestus were leather strap gloves used in the gladiator rings.  We could probably do better with today's technology, but this is what we had then, and it will work for us now.  The three of us strapped our metal discs on each hand.  Technically the metal discs were to be numerous and to help inflict more damage on impact, these had a different purpose.

We went outside and found the circle and most of the village on the village green.  Tony stood with his grandfather and, there was a man I had met before standing with the circle.  I hadn't known he had been here.  I walked up to him but did not smile. I tried not to glare at him, "Jesse."

He smiled at me, "I'm enforcer here."

I nodded, "Donatello didn't tell me.  He sent you after me?"

He shook his head and Donatello stammered the mere thought of it, Jesse laughed, "I hunt you for fun."

I glared at him and sighed, "It's a good thing, or you'd never have been paid."

Tony glared at the two of us,  "You two know each other?"

"Cari and I have had a few run ins.  I tend to hunt her to test my mettle on the best.  I've only caught up to her a few times mostly because she wanted me to."  Jesse laughed.  "And you must be the Daddy."

Tony stared at him in confusion.  Jesse motioned to Ant.  "To the lad over there.  She never would tell me whose he was.  If I'd know he'd been Giovanni I'd probably have stayed away."

Tony turned his full glare to me, "I don't want to know do I?"

I shook my head. "Probably not."

He huffed in anger.

I around the two men and handed Donatello the ten remaining rods.  "This is all I have left.  A forge and my knowledge and I can create ten more identical to what we are about to show you.  Tony has one that is for the circle to study, so you can find more metal needed to make more."

Donatello nodded, "How did you find this metal?"

"I didn't, it was stashed in one of the vaults.  I only studied it.  And of the items you've found these are the only viable option of to use today."

Ryan stepped out into the middle of the village green.  "Ryan has a different version of the same thing.  The crystal in the middle absorbs vampire powers."  I threw a bolt of fire at Ryan.  He smiled as it was absorbed into the crystal and metal disc.  He willed two flaming swords to his hands.  "The vampire magic is channeled through the crystal into the metal where a weapon is formed of the user's choice.  The discs are bound to a specific user.  No one can use another.  The binding magic is what finishes the piece."

Donatello nodded, "So you cannot finish the pieces when you make them."  I nodded.

Ant pulled out two flaming swords.  And I explained, "A vampire can push their power into the disc and a weapon of their choice.  Ant is strongest in elemental magic he prefers fire but can push whatever element he wants."

I stepped into the clearing and willed two shadow swords.  "It takes practice to wield two weapons.  Most can only do one.  We've been working for centuries to master two weapons."  I released the power.

"Empathy,  Domination, Auspex and Animal Ken all are weird, but they are still deadly.  Empathy typically yields a crystalline weapon."  I drew upon my empathy and pushed the crowd's feelings into it.  "The emotion you push will make the crystalline structure a different color, or in this case multiple colors as it is multiple feelings.  Auspex and Domination are nearly invisible and is more deadly because the opponent can't see it as readily.  Animal Ken yields fur covered weapons."  I drew upon the Animal Ken and the swords looked like I was wagging two stiff tails at them.  The crowd laughed.  "It may look a sight but it is as deadly as any of the others.  I willed one sword into shadow and the other into fire.  "If you have the strength you can maintain two of different types."  I let them go.  "Even with my practice I cannot wield it for long."

Jesse clapped.  "So when do I get one?"

I smiled, "As soon as a forge is made so I can render the discs."

He smiled at me, "What can I do to help?"

Ryan stepped forward, "You can come with me and we'll start making the forge.  It's be a while, but I'm sure we can get what she needs."  They left talking about their upcoming project.  

"Any other questions?"

A female in the back shouted, "What about Necromancy?"  Another man shouted "And Dream Walking".

I shook my head, "I do not know.  Ant and myself are not strong enough in either to test more than a glimpse.  But if I had to guess, Necromancy would be like Shadow, a dark misty weapon and Dream Walking like the other mental abilities, Domination and Auspex."

They nodded, and Donatello questioned, "How did you figure this out?"

I smiled, "I read a book about it from many centuries before I was born.  It detailed the creation procedure, and many other uses for the techniques but I was only interested in the weapon aspect.  It is too dangerous to have the book.  The book was locked away shortly after it was written.  It is not meant to be shared.  Each Keeper can pass along what information they feel necessary.  There are many structures and rules even the eldest of us do not know.  Things change, but a True Keeper can understand it and pass it along."

"You're a mongrel how can you be a True Keeper?"

I walked away.  I wasn't going to answer the question.  I heard Donatello step in, "She is a True Keeper despite her origins.  She can read the texts that we have forgotten.  She really is a True Keeper it is not our ways to doubt the First magic."

I was tired.  Tired of this war and tired of people who always questioned me.  I walked into forest, I needed to be alone, or as alone as I could get.

# The Dream Diner

The forest was quiet, it was quite enjoyable.  I could hear the critters scampering around and the birds sang.  There was no danger here, not even if a pack of werewolves lived in these woods.  I sat down with my back against a fallen try.  The quiet and serenity of the area was good for my anxiety.  The past many years had been hard on people, and many people blamed me.  I tried not to blame myself but my own anger at my own selfishness washed away all my trying.

I closed my eyes to concentrate on my own thoughts, and push away the negative ones. 

My thoughts came in waves.  First I saw my own memories, my first moment of weakness when I killed the villagers.  I felt their corpses; I felt the weight of their bodies as I drank them dry.  I saw the dreams I had when I was asleep.  The Twin Towers falling the multiple nukes going off.  I saw all the destruction that Brandon and Valence had caused.  I felt my friends being tortured.  Their deaths at my hands stabbed through my heart like a knife.  Tristan's betrayal ripped through my body in a gut wrenching swing.  

I saw things that I had not experienced in my life.  I dreamt of a diner.  I had been there before, long ago.  A man sat in a booth with his back to me.  I didn't know who he was but I felt an urgent need to find him.  And then I felt the enormous pressure of being cast away from the Clan.  Sadness overwhelmed me and I started awake.  I could still feel the magic inside me.  That fertility statue had done more than give me twins.  Their own bodies fought me, and they fought each other.  This was going to be a rough pregnancy.  I sighed as I stood up to head back to the village.  I knew I had to do something.  The diner was next on my list.  I had to go.  And I had to go now.

I found Ryan and Jesse hunting items for the forge they were building.  When I told them what I was doing they smiled and nodded.  Ryan never questioned me. I was surprised when Jesse did not.  It made me sad to know that if I had went to find Tony he would not have been like his brother, he would have questioned and he would have insisted on coming with me.  I sighed, the feelings from the dreams still lingered in my body almost as strong as they had been in the dream.

I didn't exactly know where the diner was, but I didn't need to have to know an exact location to shadow walk to someone as long as I knew who I wanted to go to I could typically find a shadow nearby.  I still wasn't exactly sure of the feeling, but I had to go, it was important.  I stepped into the shadow and found myself in the shadow of the very diner I wanted to go to.  There was no one around, the city, the town or wherever I was, was quiet.  Many cities were like that now, it was sad.  I expanded my senses to see if anyone was near or if there were any threats, finding none, I entered the diner.

I was surprised to see the same image I saw in my dream.  A man who looked vaguely familiar sat in a booth with his back to me.  The diner was empty except for the two of us.  He never turned around as I walked toward him, though I knew he was aware of the fact that I was there.  

He spoke softly when I reached his side, "I wasn't sure if you would come."

I sat down opposite him and looked at the man I had dreamt about with a bit of confusion.  He smiled at me, "I had a dream I'd meet you here."  He blushed, "It wasn't the first dream I've had about you."  He laughed, "I don't even know you."  He looked up, "Do I?"

I shook my head, "No.  I had a dream about you."

He smiled at me and stuck his hand out.  "I'm Jake Marshall."

I hesitated to shake his hand.  "Do you have a brother?"

He nodded, "Two.  Tristan and Nick."

It was my turn to look down.  "I knew Tristan."

"Knew him?"  He asked.

"He died."

He nodded.  He didn't seem surprised.  I didn't want to explain that I'd killed him, and that he was a traitor.  But it made me wonder if Jake was part of the New Order or not.

"There is something you aren't telling me, isn't there?"  He was very intuitive, he must share his brother's empathic ability, or so that was my theory.

"Yes.  It's not something good",  I paused, I didn't know how to put it.  "He was a traitor.  I guess it's a matter of perspective.  He betrayed me and the coalition."

"But he was leading it."  Jake at least knew the ins and outs of that.

I nodded, "He was placed from the very beginning to get close to me.  He was sent to meet up with my friends and family and wait for me."

"Why would they want that?"  

"I'm their biggest threat."  It was a statement of fact, I wasn't bragging.  

Jake nodded slowly. "That isn't all is it?"

I smiled, "Empath?"

He nodded.  I answered his question, "He was mine and my lover's lover."

He blushed.  "Is he a vampire too?  Dark hair and eyes, really cute?"

I cocked my head to the side curiously, "Yeah.  How did you know that?"

Jake's blush deepened, "I've dreamt about him too."

I bit my lip in what I hoped was understanding.  "You like men."  

Jake looked down.  I lifted his head with my finger so I could look into his eyes, "I don't mind.  I go either way myself."  He brightened slightly.

The door I had come in opened and I saw a familiar face walk in.  Not one I had thought I would see ever again.  I stood up and looked down at Jake then back at the new comer.  I smiled.  "Nick.  What are you doing here?"  And then it dawned on me they were brothers.

I shook my head.  "I get it now."

Jake looked up at me, "Get what?"

"What Tristan did."

Nick sat down with his brother.  They looked nothing alike, but yet I knew that they were brothers.  All three of the brothers were empaths and pretty strong ones too.

I explained, "The lot of you are connected aren't you?"  They nodded.  "Tristan used that connection.  He knew Nick and I knew each other intimately.  And you Jake, well you like men.  He used you two to make Tony and I fall for him."  I looked to Jake, "That's why you dreamt about us."

Nick smiled, "I've had dreams about you too I thought it was just nostalgia.  I guess not."

Jake elbowed his brother, "What you doing here?"

Nick laughed, "I dreamt about seeing you here.  I had to come and see.  I didn't see her though."

"Now the question is why did we all come here?"  It was curious why we had all dreamt of coming here and meeting each other.  "Though I don't think we should sit around her to figure it out."

The men nodded and got up, Jake asked, "I have no place to go."  Nick agreed.

"I can take us to my friends and family."  I lead the way to the shadows outside the dinner.  They had only gotten darker with the sun going down.  I offered each of them a head.  "It's a little disorienting, but it'll get us there."  They each took a hand and I stepped into the shadows with them.

# Trouble In Paradise

We walked into the shadows to the south of the village, but there was no doubt there was a disturbance at the village.  Every person I was connected to was fine, but the air was still unsettling.  I didn't run, but I moved quickly with Jake and Nick following behind me to the center of the village.

The circle of elders were shouting with others.  Tony was on one side, Jesse and the rest of my family was on the other.  That did not bode well.  It seemed they were fighting amongst each other as well.  My dream came to me and I knew what to expect.  As I resolved my constitution to make the move to join the commotion I felt the deep sadness wash over me, but it wasn't mine.  I stopped and stared at Tony.  He looked away from me.  I sighed and walked to the meeting of minds.

Donatello was the first too notice I had joined them.  He held up his hand and everything quieted.  He didn't smile or show any emotion.  "Cari, there is a problem."

"I figured that, what is it?"

"The weapons you are in possession of and are capable of making are in violation of our laws."  Donatello was void of all emotion.

"And?"

He sighed, "We have no choice but to banish you and any other who possess these weapons from our clan.  Violations such as these render all clan times null and void.  We will remove all bonds from you that connect you to the clan except for those of natural making such as parents and children."

I asked, "When?"

"As soon as possible.  You will be able to gather your things and say your good-byes and then you can never come back to clan lands again."  There was sadness in Donatello at that final statement.

I nodded.  "Fine.  I'm taking what belongs to my care with me." 

He sighed, "We know."

I turned and left.  You could tell who was with me as they followed me.  I was surprised to see Jesse and Henry following me.  We would discuss it when we were away from the crowd.

We gathered what little we actually owned from the various houses we'd been staying in.  Nicola hugged me tightly when she saw me.  She smiled up at me, "Henry likes you, he believes in you.  He and his dad aren't getting along anyway."

She answered my unasked question.  I hadn't known Tony and Henry had been fighting.  But then Tony rarely shared things with me about his past family.  And when it was it was always tinged with anger.  He still hated me for Sierra and China.  I don't blame him, but I was getting tired for the full blame.  They choose the other side, I didn't make them.

Meelah frowned at me from the distance.  I smiled to reassure her we'd be okay.  She spoke softly, "I don't agree with the circle or Tony, but the law is the law."

I hugged Meelah, "Don't worry about us.  We'll be fine.  I understand, I do."  

Meelah handed me a basket.  "Just some food I know the kids will like."  I smiled, she was going to be missed by all of us.

I saw Tony standing in the door way.  Meelah left us alone.  I really didn't want to talk to him, but we probably shouldn't leave it just alone like we always have.  Good-bye's would be final this time. 

Tony looked down, but he didn't say anything so I started, "Look Tony.  I love you.  I get it okay.  We are done, no need to make this harder.  I have no hard feelings, but I can't do this with you."

He glared at me, "Do what, say I'm sorry.  Say I love you? Wish I could go with you? Don't do what?"

I laughed, "You don't want to go with me.  You and I haven't been like we use to be in centuries.  We love the past, the present and the future neither of us fit together anymore.  You are angry with me about your wife and daughter.  You don't like the way I live my life, the way I raise my children.  I get it Tony.  We just don't fit.  Let's not beat the horse any more, it's been dead for a long time."

He frowned never looking up, "I love you, I do.  I just..."

I put a finger on his mouth, "No Tony.  Leave it at I love you.  I love you too.  We'll deal with the fall out.  I'm sorry you and Henry are having issues.  I will take care of him like he is my own."

Tony nodded.  "Thank you.  I wasn't even going to ask.  I know you well enough to know he's family to you now, despite me."

"This is it." I muttered mostly to myself.

I sighed, "Don't come looking for us.  I don't want to see you again.  It's not that I don't care or don't love you.  It's too hard. I can barely stand it now.  I don't know what years of missing you will do.  So just don't."

He nodded and I walked past him with my things and the basket Meelah made in my hands.  We all gathered at the village green where the breaking would occur.  All off my clanned vampires stood with me and waited for Donatello to break the bonds to the clan.  I was also breaking a marriage and my Chevalier bond to Tony.  I wasn't sure what that would do.  I had never seen a Chevalier bond broken from the outside.  And I barely survived the last one.

Donatello stood in silence as we watched him wave his hands and gather the bonds from the clan.  I could see the magic.  I was eldest by their law.  I was the strongest, but now I was being banished for trying to save them.  Trying to save the humans, that was probably a big reason why they were banishing us.  It wasn't just vampires we were saving but the cattle we eat.  I hated that philosophy on life.  

That was my last thought before all I could feel was searing pain running though my body.  And then there was nothing but the pain in the darkness.

# New Haven

The pain had changed by the time I came around.  It was not the searing pain, more like being shocked instead of burned alive.  It was hard to open my eyes, when I tried the world was blurry.  Why was it always that way?  A thought for another time.  I tried to sit up and found I could not.  A soft voice came from above me, "Lay still, you are fine."

I blinked my eyes and saw a strange man looking down at me.  I tried to pull free but I was being restrained with silver chains.  "Where am I?"

The strange man smiled, "You don't know?  They said you'd say that?"

"They?"

"The people who brought you here of course."  He put a hand on my chest to keep from trying to sit up again, "They are fine, out in the town making themselves useful."

"Where am I?"

He smiled again, "New Haven."

I closed my eyes.  "I see now why I'm chained up.  I was not aware of where we were heading.  It had not been discussed.  I would never have entered on my own."

He laughed, "Your friends explained it all too well.  Banished from the clan, the ceremony took you out, yeah we got the drill.  And they said they didn't know about the covenant."  He smiled, "Well most of them didn't, two did however."

"Yes.  Ant and Ryan should have known better."

He laughed again, "They did. they waited for permission."

I glared at him.  "Then why am I chained up?"

He smiled, "To make sure when you woke you weren't in a frenzy."

I nodded.  "Let me go know then."

He shook his head, "A new covenant must be made."

I laughed, "I won't negotiate under chains."

He started to remove the chains, "Fair enough.  Your best behavior is required."

I nodded, "Of course, I don't just kill willy-nilly."

"I remember a time when you did."

I raised an eye brow, "You know me?"

He shook his head, "Know of you.  I know about the massacre and it's the reason why this covenant was made."

I sat up.  "Okay.  What do you have in mind?"

"Your friends say you are looking for allies against the New Order.  We wish to be a part of it with one stipulation."  I waited for him to continue he laughed softly to himself and muttered something I couldn't understand, "After your family your allegiance lies with us.  You protect our citizens first before anyone outside of your family."

I was intrigued, "That's all you want, my protection."

"Without the vampire council whatever the world brings, we want you to be our champion.  We want you to be our Hound instead of the councils, ours and ours alone."

"Do you intend to use me like the council, send me after your enemies?"

He shook his head.  "No, only our protection.  The acknowledge citizens of New Haven no matter their location would be able to call upon you for protection."

I smiled, "A glorified bodyguard?"

"Sort of."

"And if I agree you will help me take down the New Order?"

He nodded, "Yes."

"And you have the power to grant such an alliance?"

"I do."  He stood up and extended a hand.  "I am Davyn Erickson, I am the Jarl of New Haven.  I invoked the first covenant with your council after your massacre.  I invoke this covenant now with you personally. Il Cane, do you accept?"

"I have one more question. May we have residence here in New Haven?"

He smiled, "If you agree you are welcome to stay here for as long as a true death does not take you or your kin."

I nodded, "I accept."  I took his hand and we shook on it.  I hadn't expected to feel such a rush of power radiate from our handshake, but it did.  I could feel new people not like a bond, more like a kinship, as if they were of my own blood.  "That's a powerful spell."

Davyn smiled proudly.  "I'm sure you have a few tricks up your sleeves as well Il Cane."

"Cari please. No need to scare your... our vampire children."

"You are a bright young woman." He laughed, "Sometimes I forget you are nearly as old as I am in relative terms.  We are not blood, but it is much like the clan bond, but more connected.  We are blood by magic if that makes sense."

I nodded.  "Can I see my family?"

"I will not keep you from them.  They are building you a forge for some mysterious purpose they will not reveal."

"I can show you what they intend to make."  He nodded and I stepped away from him and drew two shadow swords from nothing."  

Davyn stared in awe.  "And you intend to make these for whom?"

"Whoever wants one.  Well that's the theory, we have to find the means to make more my supply is limited."

# It's Not Love It's Business

Davyn nodded, "This is what you were banished for."  He shook his head.  "Some people have no perception of the issues at hand.  We will assist you in this if you'll let us."

"Fine with me, the biggest problem is finding the materials."  

Davyn smiled, "I might be able to get you some help there.  Give me a day or two."

I nodded.  "Is this all we have to discuss?"

He shook his head with a frown, "No, but it's not a topic I think you will take lightly."

"Oh?"

"I propose marriage."

I blinked and stared at him.  "You and me?"

He nodded.  "Yes.  It would be a business arrangement.  You are powerful in your own right and you are beautiful, but I am in love with another and I know you do not practice monogamy well.  I do not wish to be your lover only to cement our agreement and our future.  Sex would be required but only to cement the binding and if we wanted children of our own."

I smiled, "How does this protect the future?"

Davyn smiled, "A union between the primeval blood line and the modern vampire bloodlines.  You are not of them, but they respect you."

"They do not respect me, they fear me."

He laughed, "That may have been so at one time, but now, they respect you.  They realize in all the fear the council pushed down on them life in the New Order is not right.  You are no longer controlled, and your alliance and marriage to me would cement their knowledge that you won't get out of hand.  And I can protect you from the damages that will fallout when you kill Brandon Holt."

"You wish to protect me from my own devices?"

"In a manner of speaking.  But I do not want to harness you in anyway, only give people that perspective.  I know you are fully capable of controlling yourself.  I've watched you since then and I will continue to do so."

I nodded.  "Let me talk with my people, and I'll get back to you on that."

He smiled, "I knew you would say that.  But the sooner we do this, the sooner it's over and we can go back to our own loves."

I smiled, "Where is my family?"

Davyn lead me to the door.  It opened out into the town streets.  "They have chosen an old warehouse to refit for your needs."  He pointed me in the right direction.

I laughed, "You discussed everything with them and knew my answer."

He smiled, "But of course.  Your Ryan seems to have better understanding of you than most.  And your son is a very close second.  When they agreed on certain things I knew I would have my answer."

"Did they ever disagree?"

He laughed, "No."

I smiled, "They are two of the same.  I'm glad they are bound for life."  I started to walk away but Davyn put his hand on my arm.

"You can take Your Ryan back as lesser.  I think it may be necessary."

I smiled.  "Ryan deserves a break from my mind."

"He is always yours, is he not?"

"Yes he will be.  But he is free of my mind now.  He stays because he wants to not because he has to."

Davyn nodded, "I will see you again then."

I nodded then left to find my family.

I found Ant and Ryan with Jesse in the warehouse they were refitting to our needs.  It was probably the best solution.  Make the building fit for living in the way we desire instead of having to do so with already existing house and walls.  This made sense.

Ryan smiled when he saw me.  "About time you woke up."

I smiled, "I'm awake, but there is still some lingering energy or something."

Ant came over, "You still are in pain?"

I patted Ants arm, "Nothing I can't handle.  So you've been talking with Davyn?"

They both blushed in embarrassment.  Ant was the first to speak.  "It is a good fit.  He's not like my father.  He won't try to make you what you aren't.  It'll give us a home and the children will be able to grow up in an environment where they aren't judged."

"They could do that without the marriage."

Ant smiled, "Yes, but you need a grounding point, someone who isn't with you all the time."

Ryan stepped in, "We think that is why you and Tony did so well apart.  He grounded you.  You don't have that now."

I nodded, "So you are all for it, all of you?"

Ant and Ryan nodded, Jesse shook his head, "I wasn't consulted and it's not my place to offer opinion."

"And why not?"  He was just as much family now as anyone else that followed me.

"I'm not family, kin or even a close friend."

Ant laughed, "You really don't know Cari well do you?"

Ryan smiled, "You followed her away from your clan.  You were banished with us.  You are family.  And besides you've been in her bed more times than I can count.  You get a say in the matter."

"See Jesse, you get a say.  Now what's have you got to say about the matter?"

He smiled, "I'm glad you feel I'm part of this, but I don't feel part of it.  But I'm concerned."

We all asked together, "About?"

Jesse laughed, "Geez.  I'm concerned you are going to fall head over heels like you did with my baby brother."

Ryan chided, "Jealous?"

Jesse frowned and shook his head, "We don't know him.  He could have another motive to bind you to him."

"And do we not have a motive outside of what you shared with him?  To ground me?"

He nodded, "I guess, but it won't hurt him."

I laughed, "You think being bound to me is easy?  Ryan is it?"

Ryan shook his head.  "Not easy, but I wouldn't have traded it for the world."

"So Jesse, your concerns are valid, but they aren't enough to not do this.  Unless there is something more?"

He blushed, "You know me better than I thought.  I wanted to be in your bed."

I walked over to Jesse and put my arms around his neck and smiled up at him, "That won't change, he promised me that."

Jesse kissed me softly.  It had been a while since we'd been together.  He held me close then said, "We have things to finish here.  Go marry your new beau."

I laughed and pulled away from Jesse's embrace, it felt nice to know he didn't hate me like his brother.  "I don't think it has to be done now.  I want to see what the plan is."

# The New Plan

There was always planning to do.  We did after all still have a problem with Brandon and the remainder of the council.  I did not look forward to killing my sires.  Brandon on the other hand I wish would happen sooner, but then again I didn't.  Life was going to change dramatically for all vampires when Brandon was dealt with.  Humans know for sure that vampires exist, the other supernatural creatures doing their best to stay out of the lime light.  I didn't blame them one bit.  But I hoped that some would help fight this fight.

But the first plan I wanted to know about was our new so called living arrangements.  Ant and Ryan had floor plans laid out on a makeshift table.  They were going over the last bits of information with the construction crew they had hired.  Ryan smiled up at me, "We've got you a big room in the center of the building and the vampires spreading out from there.  The rest of us are all on the outer edges to keep you safe.  New Haven has a great security company and with your wards and the like we shouldn't ever be snuck up on ever."

Ant nodded, "We'll make this place a fortress if we get the chance.  Life is going to be different, even here in New Haven when this is all said and done."  

I agreed with him, "You took the words right out of my mouth."

We discussed a few mundane things before Ant dismissed the crew so they could finish their work.  Ant looked up at me, "And for the final blow?"

I nodded.

Ant rolled up the floor plan.  Underneath it was a map of the country.   "Intel says that Evangeline is closest to this location."  He put a red pin in the location.  "Desmond is over here.  And Virgil is way over there."

Ryan took a pen and drew a circle around a large area.  "Brandon is here somewhere we've yet to find the exact location.  Maybe one of those three will have it."

I nodded.  "Evangeline, Desmond and Virgil, in that order.  We need have more than us to take them out."

Jesse nodded, "I spoke with Dimitri while you were out of it.  His pack is in.  They can help with Virgil.  The Giovanni clan," Jesse sighed at the loss of his own clan status, "said they could help take out Desmond.  No one wants to take on the Mistress of Death herself, but I think you can persuade your new man into helping us out."

Ant added, "And if everything goes well with Evangeline, maybe more will come to our side."

I sighed, "So we have to take on Evangeline on our own.  What's her place look like?"

Ryan pulled out a series of photos and a mockup of the lay of the land.  "It's rough, but this is the best we can do with technology out of the picture at the moment."  There was a pretty sophisticated security system laid out - only the best for the New Order.  "Heat sensors, motion sensors, and knowing Evangeline death traps and many wards."

"I can take care of most of Evangeline's tricks.  But if I do I'll alert her to our presence."

From the doorway Davyn spoke, "I didn't know we were planning."

Ant laughed, "You don't know Cari very well."

Davyn chuckled, "I still can't get over you calling your mother by her first name."

I rolled my eyes, "He's almost 800 years old. He's earned the place many centuries ago."

Davyn smiled and put his arm around me as he came to stand by us, "As you say my dear."  He chuckled a bit more.  "We can help with Evangeline, and the others, if you truly want to kill them."

"With them out of the way Brandon will have no stronger allies to call upon."

He nodded, "Then she shall be the easiest of the three remaining.  Death is powerful, but in it comes a price as well."  He smiled at us, he wasn't willing to let his secret out.

Ryan laughed, "He won't tell us."  He turned to Davyn, "Don't think you can hide it from her in the end.  She's a fast learner."

Davyn smiled, "I have no doubt in my mind.  But we all like to keep our little secrets as long as we can now don't we?"

Ant continued the session, "Desmond will be difficult but with the pack and Dimitri at the helm I think we will easily push that, as long as the wolves aren't subject to his emotional outbursts."

Davyn interrupted, "Pack, as in werewolves."

I smiled, "Not just any werewolves, The First werewolves."

Davyn's jaw dropped.  "You have First allies?  I didn't even think they still existed."

"Apparently they are."  Ryan laughed sarcastically.  "Our own wolves will train with them and hunt with them when the moon phases them."

Davyn turned to me, "You are a powerful ally, more so than I had originally thought.  How do we keep Desmond from controlling their emotions."

A woman from behind us spoke softly, "With magic of course."

I turned to see a pretty red head who was no bigger than my wrist all the way around.  Davyn walked up to her and put his arms around her lovingly, "This is Skylar, my consort, my love, she's a witch."

"A wiccan," she and I said at the same time.

She smiled at me, "And you must be his wife to be."

I smiled back.  "You can craft enough to protect all of them?"

Skylar laughed, "When they said you were too the point I thought they were exaggerating."  She skipped ahead of her own thoughts, "Yes, yes I think I can.  If you will help me?"

I nodded and turned back to the meeting. "And Virgil must be done in the daylight when all are awake. Everyone must be wide awake or the cracks will be hard to pin down.  Virgil doesn't need much."

"And your former lover will be joining us then?"  Davyn inquired.

"Tony is a great fighter. I'd have him with us for all of it if he thought he could work with me."

Skylar put her arm around me, "Perhaps for the good of the cause he will join us."

Ryan shook his head, "I doubt he will.  He's pretty beat up over his wife and daughter.  He can't work with Cari well.  He tried.  He really did."

I nodded.  "We have other things to worry about.  Plans are made, we should move on with everything."

# Revelations

It seems like yesterday that I joined with Tony.  Technically it wasn't that long ago that Tony and I had performed a similar ceremony to make it official, though we had been bound together for many centuries without the clan knowing.  And now I bind myself to an unknown person for the sake of the future, not just my future, but everyone I cared about.  

Davyn seems like a good man, he's defiantly sees the big picture and cares for his community.  Jarl, mayor whatever you want to call it, he's a leader among those in New Haven.  I only hope that his tying himself to me is good for them and not seen as a blight on their community.

I felt a hand on my shoulder, "Having second thoughts?"

I looked over my shoulder to see Davyn and shook my head, "No, just hoping that you've thought through the ramifications of this juncture."

He smiled and put his arm around my shoulder, "I have, and the community voted in favor of the union.  They not only want you to be part of the family they have openly accepted The Hound of Death as a leader amongst leaders."

I shook my head.  I still didn't believe they understood, but I wasn't going to argue about it.

"We will make this work.  You are not a leader, we get that, but we will follow when where you lead us.  You have made many changes in Dangdburgh without ever having laid a hand on the policies there.  You fit in line with us, and we have much to learn from you."  Davyn was confident in his words.  He knew exactly what he was saying and what he was getting into.  He was reassuring me that it would be alright.  I laughed.  Davyn frowned, "What's funny?"

"You reassuring me that it's going to be alright."  I smiled, "It's been a while since anyone other than Ryan or Ant has tried to reassure me."  

He smiled and hugged my shoulders.  "Come we have a ceremony to complete."

I sighed, I really hated ceremony.  It was usually meant to be a spectacle but this one was magical in nature as well, as much of vampire magic is.  A binding of two bodies, bloods and in this case bloodlines.  I wondered if this was different than what Tony and I had done.  A realization hit me and I stopped in my tracks, "You are a First vampire."

Davyn laughed, "It didn't take you long to figure that out.  Though most do not know so don't say that too loud."

I frowned, "Why are you binding your line to me?"

He smiled, "You are cursed with a First soul.  A vampire in a human body, created into a vampire by mere coincidence.  Have you ever wondered why you are the way you are?"

I shook my head, "I was made to be what I am, both by my uncle and the council.  I choose my path now for the first time in centuries."

Davyn laughed, "I would say you were a legend among my people, but it's not so.  All life is connected. Souls are reborn when one dies.  You have a first soul, like many before you and many yet to come.  It is not something we look for, but on rare occasions it's hard not to notice.  You are one such occasion."

"I do not know which soul you are, but everything you have gone through and everything you have done is because you are a First soul.  I won't say that you were meant to be raped, or that you were meant to be an assassin.  But everything led you to this point.  You are coming home.  We are uniting a first blood line.  Our children will be similar to children of the first but they will be so much more different."

Davyn smiled, "I will tell you what I know, Valence Dilanti is Puer Decem like you, but he had been driven mad with the 8 powers he had been granted.  Dilanti could only preform a minor set of what you can do.  You only do what you do because you were taught the powers and you refrain from some of the more tempting ones. ".  I started to interrupt but Davyn put a finger to my lips and shook his head, "You can do much more than you do.  You keep yourself at bay, just like you keep your hunger and your anger under a strict hand.  You do this.  No one trained you.  You know how to do this in your heart, in your soul.  You are a First in spirit if not in form."

I nodded, "It is why I was reborn the First soul granted the reprieve as it may be."  

He smiled, "It is why you were reborn, it is why the fertility statue worked for you with Tony. It is why you have two sets of twins with in a five year time frame. You were born to do exactly what you are doing now."

Sklyar and Ryan walked in chatting.  I wondered how old she was.  It was a good think for Ryan to find a friend now that his sister was gone.  I would have to ask when this was done.

Davyn turned me towards him and put both his hands on my shoulders.  "It is time."

I smiled, "This isn't a public then?"

Davyn laughed, "It can be if you like, but there is no need for this ritual."

Skylar stood to my left and Ryan to my right, we all face in towards each other.  Sklyar spoke quietly but it felt like a roar in the quiet of the ritual.  "This is like what you and Tony did before you made it official.  This is a combination of wiccan and vampire magic.  It's is neither one, but without the other it would not work."

The power rose in my soul, I could feel Davyn's pulse beneath his fingers.  I put my hands on his arms and a surge ran through both of us.  Skylar smiled, "Very good, didn't even have to tell you."  I heard her, but I didn't really hear her.  All my attention was on the rush of power flowing between the two of us. 

We let go of one another and a visible stream of energy flowed between our bodies.  Davyn reached a hand out to Skylar and I did the same to Ryan.  The power followed included them. We held our hands out to the opposite, creating a circle.  We were one.  

When we all let go of hands I still felt Ryan in my mind.  We turned to each other and we stared.  Davyn laughed, "Did we forget to mention that.  It is more like a child/parent bond than Chevalier.  But it holds the same principles.  Skylar and Ryan are our links to humanity and the wiccan powers.  They are why we are who we will become."

I blinked and Ryan smiled, "It's good to have you back, though it's odd feeling you and Ant."

I smiled. It was good to have Ryan back, even if it wasn't the same.

Davyn took Ryan by the shoulder.  "Welcome to the family, but I have something to ask of you."

Ryan looked puzzled, "Me?"

Davyn nodded, "Right now with the power flow, my Skylar is actively fertile, as are you."

Ryan stopped Davyn, "You mean right now I could become a father."  

Skylar nodded, "And I a mother."

Ryan and Skylar stared at each other for only a moment before they grasped hands and wandered into another room.

Davyn laughed, "Well that was easier than I thought it would be."

"He's wanted a child for many centuries."

Davyn nodded, "So has Skylar, though probably not as long as Ryan has.  She has only been with me for four."

I nodded. Davyn answered my question without ever having asked.

He looked down at me, "Do you always feel that?"

"Feel what?"  I asked. I felt many of things all the time.

"Like you are grasping an electrical fence?"

I shook my head, "No, only since waking up here."

"Why didn't you say something?"  He looked angry.  "That's a protection against you on our land.  I see that it wouldn't have worked anyway."

I laughed, "You mean the ground is a trap, all of it.  It's a good think I'm honorable and avoided you and your barriers."

Davyn touched the ground and removed the ward.  The pain left suddenly and I had to catch my balance.

# Allies Unite

It wasn't long before Ant opened the door.  He was not smiling, but there was a certain energy about him.  "Some of our allies are showing up."  He stepped inside and I immediately saw why he was not smiling.  Tony was following him in, "Tony wants to talk to you.  Privately."

Davyn put his hand on my shoulder, "I'll leave you two alone, but I'm only a thought away."

I saw jealousy rise up in Tony.  That was good and bad.  Tony watched Davyn and Ant leave. If looks could kill Davyn would probably be dead.  He turned back to me with that same glare. It only softened slightly as he walked to me.

I stood and stared back at him.  I really didn't want to have to talk to him more than needed.  I was not in the mood to fight with him.

Tony took something from behind his back and handed me the small cloth package.  "You can have it back."

I took it, from the weight of it I knew what it was.  I unfolded the cloth carefully to reveal what I knew it was, the dagger I had given him when he was just a boy.  I stared back at him in confusion.

"I don't need it anymore."  It was all he said as he turned around to leave.

"I gave it to you centuries ago and now you don't want it."

He didn't turn back around, "I don't love you anymore. I don't deserve it."

"So?  It was a gift."  I put on hand on his shoulder and turned him towards me.  And put the dagger back in his hand. "You deserved it then, I don't want it back now."

Tony thrust the blade back at me.  "Cari.  Stop.  I do not want it.  I do not love you.  I don't think I ever did."

I sighed and wondered the same thing, but it was too late now.  But Tony didn't stop there, "I don't trust you anymore.  I've lost everything because of you.  You are the reason this alliance is necessary.  You are the reason we are all in this mess."

I glared back at him.  "It's not my fault Sierra and China are dead.  You killed them."

"Because I had to, it was the only way I was getting out of it alive."  

"And there you have it, you being as selfish as I was.  Only I didn't do it to save my life."  I poked him in the chest.  "I did it to save your life, and Ryan's and Mia's.  I would have gladly died to save this from happening."

Tony was glaring at me but he didn't say anything.  In a calm cool voice I spoke softly to Tony, "I'll prove it to you."  I held the hilt of the dagger out to Tony with the blade just above my heart.  "Kill me if it'll make you feel better."

"You know it won't kill you."  Tony sneered.

"But you can't do it either."  Tony took a step towards me and stopped.

I didn't wait for him, but he never moved a muscle,  I plunged the dagger into my heart.  I felt it stop beating and I collapsed to the floor.

I don't know how much time had passed before I woke back up.  Not much from the scene.  I was still lying on the floor in a pool of blood.  Tony stood away from the crowd around me.  Davyn and Skylar had worried looked on their faces.  Ant and Ryan looked as calm as could be.

Ant frowned at me when he saw my eyes open, "And what did that prove?"

I smiled as I sat up.  "Nothing.  But it made me feel better."  I stood up and walked out of the room.  I didn't care what happened afterwards.  I didn't care if Tony went crying back to the clan.  I was tired of his attitude.

Outside the room I was surprised to see so many people.  People I hadn't expected to see.  Ryan put his arm around me and in his usual jovial manner whispered to me, "When Il Cane calls so many come."    I don't know if it is out of respect of it is out of fear, but either way I was glad we were not going to finish this war alone.  

Alec and Valentine were in the room with William.  The beach conclave we had found was here in force.  My current herd of humans were joyfully reunited with their friends and family they had left to join me on my journey.  I was thankful everyone was getting this chance.

Dimitiri and the pack were here, and with him he brought more First Therians than I had ever seen.  Granted that wasn't a lot, but it was a wonderful sight to see.

Aurora and Francesco had come back.  When they saw me they hurried over to see me.  Aurora hugged me tightly, "My dear, why did you stab yourself so close to the end?"

I only smiled back at her.  Francesco laughed, "Tony probably aggravated her. He's good at that."  He put his arm around me, "You may not be blood, or even clan, but you are family to me."

I smiled up at him, it meant a lot that he was still seeing me as family.  He really was the only father figure left in my life.  I had killed the only other person who held that status.  I sighed at the memory of that day.  It was not one of my greatest accomplishments despite its results.

I walked through the crowd of people to what appeared to be a stage.  I didn't know why but it felt appropriate to say something.  I was not a leader.  I do not want to be a leader.  But here I am taking the lead on the final assault.  Why?  Because someone has to, they all came in my name.  I had to step up to the call.

I stood with my back to the crowd for several minutes.  I didn't know what I was going to say.  I could feel encouragement from Davyn and Ryan.  And when I turned around all eyes were on me.

"Today marks the first day of the rest of our lives.  What we do from here on out is because we tried.  We may not win, but we aren't going to go down without a fight.  We don't have to kill all our enemies.  We only have to cut off the head of the snakes.  We have already weakened them.  We need to weaken the New Order further.  And to do so we need to reduce Brandon's power threshold.  We take down the rest of the council and then only the head will remain.  

"Evangeline won't be easy to kill.  But with the help of the clan of New Haven, we have a plan to use her own skills against her.  

"Desmond is not a fighter, as he puts it he's a lover.  He is empathy personified.  If you feel it he can manipulate you.  Skylar and I will help you keep Desmond at bay but you must believe in magic.  This magic will only work if you believe it will.  It will be hard for most of us.  But you can do it.  We can beat Desmond.

"Virgil is only a real threat if you are tired.  We will go in and we will take him out after a good rest.  If you even feel slightly tired, do not come.  No one will fault you. we will look highly on your good judgment.  The sacrifice of the one for the many.

"With these three out of the way, only Brandon and his entourage will stand in our way for victory.  It will be the hardest battle and we will lose many friends and family in the battle.  But we will fight on.  We will give our children and their children's children the victory they deserve.  If we don't, someone will follow us.  Someone will free our children from what we fight against.  It will happen, in the end we will win"

A triumphant huzzah rang through the crowd.  I smiled and stepped away from the stage.  Those I passed touched my shoulder or arm.  Davyn stepped up on the stage behind me and I turned around to see what he had to say.  Ryan and Ant stood at my side protecting me from those wishing to chat.

Davyn held open his arms, "All of you are welcome to take part in the grand celebration of our freedom tonight.  Eat, drink, not too much and be merry.  Spend this time with your friends and family and be ready to fight tomorrow."

# Unexpected Visitor

As music started to play the general level of noise increased. Parties were not my favorite things in the world.  Truly I did not like them.  I stood in a corner of the community center.  Someplace I could be seen, but not bothered.  Ant and Ryan sat at a table in front of me.  They chatted and spoke and many people came to sit with them.  They were a barrier between me and the world.  It was such a fine line that few dared cross it, all those except the ones that were close to me.  Nicola and Henry came to talk with me a couple of times through the night.  They were glad to see Henry's family from the Giovanni clan.  I was glad they didn't take his banishment as a sign to bar him from their presence like his father did.

Tony never once came to me, he danced with his daughters and spoke with Ant and Ryan, but he never even looked my way.  I think he was mad at me for having picked up someone new so quickly.  No matter the reasons he would never understand it.  He didn't understand me well enough to understand anything of what I do.  I hurt but there was nothing I could do.  We needed to move on and get past everything that had happened in the past.  Watching Tony with the girls made my heart ache, they would never know their father.  If for anything, I'd hope that Tony would understand the father figure in their lives was necessary.  Ryan and Ant can't always be that for the children.

Nick and Jake were still adjusting.  Jake took to staring at Tony and Tony never realized what was going on.  He'd look at Jake and then look away as if he'd not even seen the man watching him with lustful eyes.  It was time to do something about it.  I moved away from my safety zone with Ryan and Ant staring after me, I could feel their eyes on my back.

I took Jake by the hand and smiled, "Come on."

Tony was still on the dance form with Morgan and Carissa.  The girls hugged my legs when I walked up to them.  "Daddy's teaching us to dance."

I smiled.  "I'm so happy for you.  Is he a good teacher?"  

Carissa smiled, "The best."

I hugged the girls, "That's great.  Can I talk with Daddy for a few minutes?  I'm sure Ryan or Ant would love to dance with you two."  They giggled and nodded their acceptance and ran off to find the men they so adored.  

Tony stared at me with fire in his eyes.  I ignore him.  "Tony, this is Jake."    I put Jake's hand in Tony's, "Jake is Tristan's brother.  He's seen you from Tristan's eyes.  He wants to get to know you."

Tony glared at me, "I don't like men.  You know this."

I laughed, "You didn't say that to Tristan.  You need to have a discussion with Jake.  Not me.  He likes you.  He's seen more of you than you'll ever know.  Maybe he can help you control your temper when it comes to me being that both of you are empaths."

I walked away I could feel Tony's glare on my back.  He hated me.  And right now I didn't care.

Nick stopped in front of me, "I hope that doesn't hurt Jake."

"Well it's better he hurt him now than Jake pine over him forever.  Jake's a Therian he'll live a long time with that.  At least if it's over he'll know."  I leaned in to Nick and whispered, "But between you and me, I think they'll hit it off.  Tony needs a new 'wife'.  Someone to love him and he to love without all my baggage."

Nick laughed and put his arms around my waist.  I obliged him and put my arms around his neck.  He pulled me close to his body.  I could smell the blood in his veins.  I could feel his desire.  The one problem with being near an empath is that a mere touch can mean so much more than from anyone else.  Nick whispered in my ear, "No one ever reacts to me like you do."

I know I had explained it to him before but now was not the time to explain it again.  Instead I buried my head in his chest, taking in his scent and keeping my mind on him, rather than him as food.

We danced, if you could call it that for a while.  No one bothered me, well not no one because someone did interrupt us in the end.  Jesse came to us he put his hand on my arm and pulled me into his embrace.  Nick didn't glare at him but he didn't have a friendly look either.  I looked up at Jesse and I could see the fear and pain in his eyes.  Something was wrong.  I put my hands on his face and it gave Jesse the opening he wanted.  He stabbed me in the chest with a silver knife, he barely missed my heart.  

I slowly slide to the knees still propped up against Jesse.  Someone screamed and then there was a mass panic.  It really was a miracle we were not trampled in the mist of it.  In moments the community hall was empty except a few souls.  Jesse had collapsed nearly on top of me.  If he had hit my heart I would have been down for the count, but I could still move, the initial shock over.  I cradled Jesse's face in my hands and that's when I felt Virgil's presence.  I managed to mutter, "The dream walker."

Ryan put his hand on my shoulder and I felt a sudden surge of energy.  I pushed my shields over Jesse.  I spoke in broken sentences.  "Get... book... bag... quickly."

I saw Nick run off in the direction of my belongings.  Hopefully he'd find it.  I prayed he would. 

Ryan let go and I felt weaker.  He sighed and he put his hands on my shoulder again.  I felt better.  

"Kill ... him... now",  was all I managed to get out.  My energy was slowly slipping away.  Ant pulled Ryan away, "Davyn thinks Skylar can take your place.  We need you."

I nodded.  "Yes.  Go.  Fine."

Ryan let go and Skylar quickly touched my shoulder.  She wasn't nearly as strong as Ryan but it would help no matter what.  "Kill him... trapped here."

Ryan nodded and Tony, Ant and Ryan slipped off into the shadows to find the Dream Walker and slay him while he was trapped in Jesse's body.  I only hoped I had the strength to keep him here.  Davyn touched my other shoulder and the surge of power leaped and I knew then that we would take down the Dream Walker.

Davyn asked, "What's in the book?"

I still could barely speak with the dagger in my chest, "Spell."

Skylar let go and the power barely diminished.  She pulled the dagger from my chest.  Nick arrived with the book.  Skylar spoke to him softly and then Nick offered me his wrist.  I drank willingly. I needed the blood to heal the wound.  

I felt better with just that little bit of help from Skylar and Nick, it would take much more to heal, but it was a start.  "Flip halfway through and then halfway again.  Take the middle portion and flip halfway again.  In the section towards the end you will find a spell with a sigil next it."

Skylar and Nick flipped through the book and I could feel Virgil struggling in Jesse.  He was pounding against my shields.  I hoped Jesse would survive this.  Skylar turned the book to me, "Is this it?"

I nodded.  "Yes, when they get back we must do the spell, to vanquish his soul forever and relieve Jesse of his possession."

Davyn asked, "You mean he could stay there indefinitely?"

I nodded, "Virgil is not the first host the Dream walker has possessed.  He has lived many lives in many hosts.  He is not First nor primeval but he is older than old."

Minutes passed and then what felt like hours before they returned with the news.  Ryan nodded.  "We beheaded his body and burnt it.  Here is his head.  You can burn it."

I smiled, Ryan knew how to bring the proof required.  Skylar helped me prepare the spell.  She cut the sigil into the palm of my hand.  I placed it on Jesse's cheek and I poured my power into him through the sigil.  The chant was a simple latin phrase which translated loosely to "leave this body".  The embodiment of what was Virgils soul evaporated from Jesse's mind.  He was alone and he collapsed into my arms.  He had very little strength left, but the dream walker was dead.  

I thought about the Dream walker's head and it leapt into flames.  Ryan dropped it quickly to the ground where it burned.  He laughed.  He knew it wouldn't hurt him, but he still dropped it anyway.  It didn't necessarily go according to plan but two out of the remaining three council members were the only thing left standing in our say to Brandon's destruction.

#The Hunters

Virgil was gone and Evangeline and Desmond were the only two left standing.  The only two left between full out war on Brandon Holt, our creator and our destruction.  He may have been one of many who created our kind.  But he destroyed us just as he created us by giving us a public face.  We would never again live in the shadows because of him.  How the world was changing.

Jesse and I recovered for days.  Very few people wanted to be near us.  Jesse was feared among the humans.  He had almost killed me and many were afraid he would try again.  But we knew better.  It wasn't the first time the Dream walker had possessed someone in our group.  How they had gotten to Jesse I don't know, but it didn't take much for the dream walker to get a hold of one's mind.

Evangeline was next on our list.  She was one that was going to be difficult to kill.  Her strongest ability was being able to control many vampires at the same time.  She was dangerous to any vampire.  The humans and Therians would be key to this battle, and they didn't even realize how much we were going to depend on them.

We had plenty of time to plan this attack.  But what we hadn't counted on was a large number of human vampire hunters walking up to our door step.  New Haven was a place few people actually knew existed much less vampire hunters or any other human for that matter.  New Haven was safety for the occult, for people of supernatural abilities.  It took supernatural abilities to find New Haven other wise you'd be politely turned in another direction without even knowing it.

But early one morning a small girl came running into our so called home.  "Miss Cari.  Miss Cari." she shouted as she ran around looking for me.

When I stepped into view she nearly collided into me.  She grinned up at me but then quickly turned around, "Come, Follow me.  Quickly."

The citizens of New Haven were now my responsibility, there was little I could do, I could feel the pull to help, whatever it was that was the problem.  But it wasn't magic that made me want to help.  I was surprised to find that it was the sheer wanting to that made me move quickly with the little girl.

Once outside and to the edge of town, I saw the mass of humans with torches sitting on the edge of the town lines as if there were a magical barrier keeping them out.  I leaned down to the little girl and told her to go someplace safe.  She didn't hesitate and ran back off into town.

I stared out into the crowd.  I wasn't sure what or who I would find.  There were many angry faces, but all were dirty and weary.  I walked towards them in hopes that someone would step forward as their leader.  The mass started to part and in the throng of humans stood a familiar face - Taylor Graves.  

Taylor didn't advance, nor did he let go of the girl's hand he held.  She was probably not a girl anymore, but she clung to her protector and guardian like I was going to kill her.  I smiled, "Taylor.  Annabeth.  Why are you here?"

The mass of people surrounded the three of us.  Annabeth quietly asked, "How do you know my name?"

"I know a great many things about you."

She stood firmly and puffed out her chest like she was threatening me, "Like what?"

I laughed, "Like you take after your guardian in his hatred of me.  That he saved you from a coven of vampires that ravaged your family and town."

Annabeth's poise dropped and she lessened her guard.  "And you killed his family."

I shook my head, "No Annabeth, I did not.  I killed the vampire who killed his family; he caught me after that fact.  He does not believe because he does not wish to."

Taylor spoke up, "I believe you.  Now.  That is why we are here, because I believe you are the only hope of saving the human race from slavery and slaughter."

I nodded, "If you and your friends promise me that they will not take the life of any of my kind until this war is over, we will offer you food and shelter and bring you into the battle at hand.  We could use your help."

The crowd nodded their acceptance, "Until the war is over."

I nodded.  "Come with me."

They followed me into town.  Their torches lighting the way.  Taylor caught up to me, "Is this going to be okay with the Jarl?"

I turned to look at him, "What do you know of New Haven?"

Taylor smiled, "Enough to know to stay away from it, even though it would be a good place to kill many vampires if I ever wanted to end my life."  He laughed.  It wasn't all that funny but he thought he was being clever so I smiled.

"Davyn won't mind.  He charged me with protecting his people, that's what I'm doing.  If your people follow the agreement then we will all be fine and can work together."

As if his name called him Davyn appeared in the distance.  He looked over the incoming influx of people and nodded.  When we were within easy listening range he spoke to us, "It is good to have you.  I trust Cari has reached an agreement as you are all hunters of some sort or another?"

Taylor nodded, "She has.  It's a pleasure to meet you Jarl.  And a bigger pleasure to be working with you to end this war."

Davyn smiled at me, "He's eloquent."

"He's being polite so you don't kick him out."

Taylor laughed.  "I was not"

Davyn nodded, "They will come in handy, yes?"

I nodded, "Yes.  They will be very handy in the next phase."

Taylor turned to me, "What's your plan?"  He paused a moment and waved his hand and two other men came forward.  They looked grim and touch.  They gave me that I'm going to kill you look I'd seen so many times from hunters.  Taylor continued, "This is Dom and Rick, they are actually the leaders of this crowd."

I nodded.  "A pleasure I'm sure."

They glared at me and I turned back to Taylor, "Our plan is to go after Evangeline and then Desmond before taking out Brandon."

Dom was a large man and when he spoke softly I was surprised, "You are on a first name basis with these monsters?"

I smiled to lessen the blow "Evangeline and Desmond are two of my sires.  Brandon is the brother of one of my father figures in my life.  So yes I know then by first name."

They all stared back at me. I shook my head and got straight back to business, there was no point rehashing their hatred of me and my kind, "Evangeline is a Necromancer, she controls the dead, and more specifically vampires.  None of our vampires can safely go up against her.  We have to rely on humans and Therians."

Rick asked, "Therians?"

Taylor laughed, "We don't know much about other supernatural creatures.  We hunt vampires and pretty much only vampires."

I nodded.  "Therians are shape-shifters of sort.  In the movies you would call a Wolf Therian a Werewolf."

Shock ran across the other two men's faces.  One shuddered, "What else is real?"

"There are many things supernatural that exist.  You'd be surprised by every one of them, but none of them are here, just human magic, Therian and vampire.  The lot of you will have to go in to kill Evangeline.  I will go, but other than Ant I'm not sure any other vampire will make it without causing more harm to the cause."

"Why can you go?  You are a vampire too."  Rick asked.

"I was created and trained to resist any vampire magic any given vampire could throw at me.  Evangeline was my teacher. I know what she is capable of."  I looked around to the other men, "We won't just be killing vampires.  Humans have taken sides with them.  They wield guns and will shoot you on sight.  You can't be squeamish about who you kill.  We kill anyone in our way"

Dom, Rick and Taylor looked at each other surveying each other.  It was almost telepathic, but I knew better it was something you learned by being close with someone else.  They nodded, "We will take this to our fellows and make sure only those willing will come with us.  How do you intend to do this?"

Davyn and I lead our new found friends to the planning area and Ant and Ryan went through the plan again.  We would attack at day.  That brought up questions about me and the sunlight. I assured them I would be fine.  It didn't take long for the plan to be conveyed.  They went to their fellows and with the hour we were ready to go.

It was a lot quicker than I had expected really.  Dimitri had Gnart, the leader of the First be our liaison to the remainder of the Therians.  Gnart was a man tiger.  It was off putting but he was a gorgeous specimen.  Gnart was also telepathic and he grinned widely at me when I thought it.  His voice was gravely from vocal cords that weren't quite right for human speech, "You are a fine specimen yourself."

I laughed.  "We have more important things to do."

Taylor cracked a joke, "You'll sleep with anything won't you?"

"I slept with you."  I retorted.

Taylor laughed, but the others around him stared at him in shock.

Taylor started to defend himself, but I interrupted him, "There is no need to defend your actions.  Anyone of them would do the same given the chance."  I glared at them.

Dom was angry, "You are saying that you are that irresistible?"  He turned to his comrades, "Such an ego."

I laughed.  And sauntered over to him with that alluring walk Evangeline had taught me so long ago.  I didn't even have to extend my powers.  I ran my fingers down Dom's puffed out chest and you could see his reaction long before he walked away from me.  "I know how to do what I do and I do it well.  Magic or no, I can seduce the lot of you."

# Death Do Us Part

Ryan put his hand around my waist.  "Ant wants to talk to you."  We walked to where Ant was standing.

He didn't smile, it was serious.  "You need Ryan."

"He's going with me."

Ant shook his head, "No, you NEED Ryan."  Ant handed me a book written in a language that few could read.  I read the passage he was pointing and looked up at him in shock.  

"Seriously?"

Ryan and Ant both nodded and in unison said, "Yes."

Ant continued, "It's great having my best friend in my head, but you need him.  You need that.  I can pass you the bond forever.  No new deaths needed."

I looked at Ryan and he smiled at me, "I'm the one who suggested it." He said to me to assure me.  "I miss you, and while it's great and calm with Ant it's harder for me."

"If it's what you both want."  They nodded.

The process wasn't hard.  A new blood bond, Ryan and I cut our hands and we let our blood mingle together as we grasped hands.  And put his hand first on Ryan and then on me and I felt a jolt and then Ryan was clearly in my head.  I hadn't even heard Ant whispering the spell to make it happen.  Ant smiled at me, "Mother, this is all I can do to help you in this battle.  I can't defend as well as you.  I'm sorry."

I hugged Ant, "I wasn't going to ask you to come.  I don't want to lose you."

Davyn interrupted us, "It's time, everyone's ready to go."

And we went through the Shadows to Evangeline's compound.

As soon as we stepped through it was utter chaos.  Evangeline had been ready for us.  Guns were going off in all directions, bodies fell on both sides.  I saw Evangeline behind the mass of her protectors.  She looked frustrated and I smiled at her.  She saw me and ran the other direction.  It was times like these I wished I'd had more of a necromancer calling or even domination.  But I had one thing that they couldn't fight.  I projected fear in front of me.  I made everyone cower before me as I waded through the bodies, both live and dead.  

Taylor and the others followed behind me knocking out any human they encounter that was still alive, and killing any vampire they found.  I wondered in one moment how they could tell the difference.  But that was a question for another time.  I knew Evangeline's magic.  I could follow her to the ends of the earth and she knew it.  She was trapped her in her compound and I knew that we'd have more trouble coming soon.

From the shadows behind us, a wave of vampires waded into my men.  Evangeline had called for help.  As I turned I saw the man responsible for bringing them through.  Charles had once been adviser to Francesco, but now he was on the other side.  He threw fire at my men.  I extended my shields as best as I could, but I wasn't able to save most of them from the fire that soon engulfed them.

I fought back the nausea caused by the burning flesh.  I moved forward with a small contingent of men.  We moved quickly with a pack of vampires on our tails.  Thankfully they were lesser vampires and fell easily with the silver the men behind me carried.  But their ammo was limited and I knew we had to do something else.  I busted down a door and lead the men inside.  They quickly made barricades while I stood in the door way.  Once they were settled I walked back into the hallway with shadow swords in hand.  I cut a swath through the vampires, the remainder flooded into the room I had left.  All I could hear was a hail of bullets flying from the room.  My goal was Charles.

He saw me coming and he smiled at me.  He thought he could take me on.  I didn't give him the satisfaction as I thought of him on fire and he screamed.  I watched as he ran the other direction.  The flames would burn him alive no matter where he went.  They would not take down the compound, or leave if he went through the shadows.  Once the flames started they only stopped when their job was done.  It was not a fair fight, but I didn't care.  

The remaining vampires stared at me and laid down their weapons and knelt on the floor.  But they were served no quarter from the men behind me.  They dusted each one of them.  I wasn't going to chide the men, they were vampire hunters, I was lucky they hadn't tried to kill me yet.

We started back on Evangeline's trail, when I broke in her study she looked surprised to see me.  She tried to scurry into a corner.  She begged for her life.  I would take no quarter her.  I advanced on her and I swung both of the shadow blades through her throat.  Her head toppled to the floor and the men behind me let out a yell of joy as the flames engulfed both the head and the body.  

I turned to Dom, "Burn it all down"

He looked at me with questioning eyes, Taylor answered him, "Her flames only burn what they are set upon."

Dom nodded and he gave word to the men with flame throwers.  Evangeline's compound would burn to the ground.

We made it to the shadows in time.  The flames behind us were removing most of the shadow.  Thankfully there was only a few of us left.  We moved quickly and we were back in New Haven just in time.  The last man through was putting out a fire that had nabbed his coat sleeve.

Evangeline was gone.  Only one more Council member stood in our way, Desmond.

#Everything I Ever Wanted and More

When we got back everyone celebrated a little and mourned the loss of our fallen comrades.  We had lost nearly half our forces when Charles came up the rear.  It hadn't been a pretty battle but it was a victory and only Desmond was left.  Desmond wasn't easier he wasn't harder to vanquish, he was just different.

We regrouped. We reached out to our sources and made sure Desmond was where he was supposed to be.  It would take hours before we learned his final whereabouts.  We'd have to change directions if it changed, but for now the whole town celebrated our current victory.  Davyn warmly welcomed the hunters into his home.  And the hunters took what was offered.  Who would refuse free drink and food and a warm place to stay.  I didn't know any who would.

But there was clearly factions within our unit of war.  The Therians kept to themselves.  The New Havenites were in their own little group.  And the refugees were in another.  The hunters were completely separated from the others.  The only group that seemed to mingle was my own family.  Ant bounced between groups laughing and joking with them all.  Ryan danced with all the pretty women regardless of creed.  Even Francesco and Aurora moved from group to group mingling.  We were the glue that held this alliance together.  I'm glad they were doing a far better job of it than I was.

They partied for hours.  Davyn had other plans.  He took me aside to his own home.  He put his arms around me and kissed me with a passion I had not know he'd had.  Davyn whisered to me, "You save us and I find myself oddly attracted to you."  His kiss deepened and I could feel him in my mind.  I could feel his wants and his desires.  

But worse of all I could feel his deepest secrets.  He longed for a life mate.  He longed for his huntress.  Davyn wanted me to fill his deepest needs.  He wanted to hunt with me.  He wanted me to break free of my self made changes and live the life a vampire should live.  

If I had been in my own control instead of at the mercy of my own powers I could have fought the urge to fill his every need, to be a normal vampire.  It rang so close to what Alistair had told me so long ago that looking back on it I'm surprised I let myself go.  But it wasn't my control I lost, it was the power of my empathic connection.  I had not control over it.  I conformed to his need.

There was no longer passion in my loins.  There was no longer a desire to make love to this near stranger.  Lust was no more, I was filled with an over powering hunger.  I had to feed.

I left Davyn's embraced and he looked after me with a confused look.  He didn't understand and I definitely couldn't explain to him right then.  All I wanted was food.

I opened the door and outside stood humans.  I closed my eyes and felt the heart beats and my own heart raced in tandum.  I reached for the nearest man and sank my fangs into his soft throat.  He gasped for air and surprise as I drank deeply from him.  

I could feel the life leaving the man, but before I could take the last of his life force from him I was ripped away from the close to dead man. I felt a familiar calming affect wash over me.  I looked up and found Tony grasping me from behind.  He wasn't paying me any attention as he glared at Davyn.

Tony yelled.  "What the hell did you think you were doing?"  He yelled at Davyn, not at me.  I found the thought oddly soothing, he wasn't directing his anger at me for once.

Davyn stared at the two of us.  "I was going to make love to her.  As if it were any of your business, and she just walked away."

Tony pulled me inside and slammed the door before loosening his grip on me.  He didn't hold me tightly but I had no desire to leave.  Tony shook his head, "You're a fool.  You can't give her your full self.  She can't handle it."  

Davyn looked at me as if I were a stranger to him, "She's strong enough to handle it, you just never give her the credit."

Tony laughed, "Does this look strong enough?  Does she look like she wants to be your lover?  Does this," Tony grabbed my shoulders and made me face Davyn, "look like she is handling it well?  She was going to kill that man because you wanted her to be normal.  You wanted to hunt with her, you wanted to free her from her chains.  I can feel your stench all over her.  And  I'm not talking about physical smells here."

Davyn looked in the mirror and then back at me, "I did want that.  All I did was give her myself, just as she gives me."

Tony nodded, "Yeah, I know."  He frowned, "But as much as you want to you can't.  I had to fight for months to get her back after I gave her everything of me.  I thought it would help, but it made things worse."

I looked up at Tony, "But that's what gave us Ant."

He looked down at me and smiled, "You know that for sure?"

I nodded and smiled.  

Davyn looked at us with something akin to hatred, "Why is she so calm, if she wants to hunt so bad?"

Tony let me go and the hunger washed over me again.  I tried to make a dash for the door behind me but Tony grabbed my wrist just in time and pulled me back into his arms, he spoke softly, "Calm down Cari.  It's okay."  I could feel his warm embrace and the hunger cooled, "We sat for days like this after she killed that town.  And when the hunger would wash over her before we had a supply of blood for her, we would sit like this for hours.  It became second nature."

A light went off in Davyn's eyes, he smiled and frowned all at the same time, "I'm sorry but don't think this union will work."

Tony laughed, "You thought it was going to be easy?"  He laughed harder.

Davyn nodded, "Yes, it should have been."

"If she were normal."

Davyn nodded again, "But she's not.  Sadly."

Tony smiled, "It's not that bad really."  He kissed the top of my head.  "Mind if we have a few moments alone?"  He looked up at Davyn?

"I will come back at dawn, ya'll better not be here."

Tony nodded, "I can't guarantee that, but I will try."

Davyn glared at Tony, "You can't have sex for that long."

Tony smiled at Davyn, "I never said anything about sex.  It's going to take a while to get her out of this state."

There was a knock at the door.  Tony moved me out of the way and Davyn answered the door.  I heard Ryan asked, "Everything okay?"

Davyn looked back at Tony and he nodded, "Tony says it's alright.  I was just leaving."

Ryan poked his head in the door, "You sure you want to do this?"

Tony took a deep breathe, "Yeah.  Time to mend the bond I broke.  Jake talked some sense into me."

Ryan smiled, "Glad someone could.  And I'm glad you let him stick around."

Jake pushed Ryan in to the door, "Let who stick around?"

Jake looked at Tony holding me.  Ryan smiled, "It's okay Jake, he still wants your body too."

I could feel the glare Tony gave Ryan.  Ryan just laughed as he shut the door behind him, "I'm only a thought away."

#Deja Vu

Jake looked at the two of us, he almost leered at Tony, he had very little room for me his sexual preferences, if any at all.  

Tony smiled, "He was right though."

Jake nodded, "You love her don't you?  You see it now, you know it?"

Tony laughed, "Just don't tell her okay, she'll smack me around a bit for not realizing it sooner."

Jake laughed too, "I won't even hint at it."  He looked at me with concern, "How are you going to fix this?"

Tony frowned and looked down at me, "Something you'd rather not be here for."

"You're going to have sex with her."

Tony defended his actions, "Not intentionally, but yes more than likely it would end up there."

Jake put his hand on Tony's arm, "Can I watch?"

Tony raised an eye brow, "I didn't think you'd be interested."

Jake turned three shades of red but he didn't say anything.

Tony nodded, "It's not going to be pretty at first and you probably won't like what I have to do."

Jake nodded and he bit my arm to show Tony he understood.  Tony laughed, "Not yet."

And then their attention was both on me, as if I were some main course at a fine dinner.  But it wasn't dinner, and it wasn't sex.  Tony opened himself to me.  I felt his power.  I could feel his heart beating with mine.  I could feel his secrets as if they were my own.  He opened the flood gates but the only thing Tony concentrated on was loving me.  Not loving the person I could be, or the person he wanted me to be.  He showed me the person he saw me as.  The person he wanted me to be and it was no different than what I was.  He had finally come to accept me for who and what I was, in all my so called glory.  He loved me.  A tear streamed down my cheek and Tony kissed it away as he whispered to me, "I didn't think that would work."

I smiled with my eyes still closed, "Jake helped us."  I could feel his hand at the small of my back.  

Jake leaned in to my and I could feel he was eager for something else.  He pushed his body against my back side and he whispered to the two of us.  "I dreamt of this."

Tony took a step back but I pulled him back to me.  "Jake, do you want to go here?"

He pushed himself against me through his jeans, "I never thought I would want to, but yes."

Tony kissed Jake over my shoulder and in a tangle of hands and arms our clothes came off.  We relived the night with Tristan except with Jake.  It's not fair to compare the two but Jake was far better than Tristan could ever have dreamed of being.  

When it was all said and done, Jake whispered in my ear, "That was better than I dreamt it.  But I don't think I can do it again.  No offense."  Jake bit my ear and I bit back a moan of pleasure. 

I leaned up on my elbows, "That's okay Jake.  We can share him separately."

Tony pulled us apart.  "What was that?"  He smiled at us fondly.

"He just said he couldn't do that again."  Jake blushed.  I put my hand on his knee, "Really it's okay.  You can take him to your own bed without me.  I won't mind."

Tony pushed me away and pulled Jake in close and I watched as they made love.  It was far sweeter than any female male courtship I had ever watched before.  Tony did feel for this man, and I wasn't going to be the one to get in the way.

Jake blushed when he realized I was still here.  I shook my head as I pulled the last of my clothes on.  I was surprised they had survived.

Tony laughed, "Jake, she's not bothered by it."  I looked at Jake trying to figure out what he was embarrassed about.  Tony grinned at me, "He's afraid you will dislike him for wanting to fuck me not make love to me."

I smiled and Tony laughed, "She would have rather watched that."

Jake didn't waste time in a blur of movement he pulled Tony around and pushed himself inside Tony.  Tony bit back a yelp of displeasure.  I could feel his pain, but it turned quickly to pleasure and Jake ravaged his body.  I could feel Jake's power wafting over Tony.  It was filling the room.  I watched as his body started to bend and break in places a human body should not.  I put my hand on Jakes back and leaned in to him.  "Don't focus on the anger, the force.  Focus on the pleasure."

Jake huffed as he spoke, "If I do I'll come too fast."

"Trust me.  Don't focus on you, focus on him.  You're an empath.  Fuck him, but don't let the beast control you."  I put my hand on top of Jake's and dug his finger nails into Tony's back.  "Don't let the beast tame you, tame the beast.  Give that energy someplace to go.  Tony will survive it and he will enjoy it.  Fuck him.  Don't let the beast fuck you and make you give up your pleasure."

Tony gasped for air as Jake brought them both.  They collapsed in a writhing mass of sexual tension that I wasn't even aware was here.

Tony pushed Jake off the top of him and he looked up at me with a sex hazed look and smiled, "Thank you."

Jake put his head on Tony's chest and looked up at me with pride, "Yes, thank you.  I would have turned."

Tony patted Jakes back, "I wouldn't have minded."

I fought back an image but Tony shared it anyway in my mind.  The memory of Jake's furry body inside of him.  I shuddered with pleasure.

Jake asked, "What are you doing to her?"

Tony laughed, "Sharing with her." Jake blushed.  "She is far more willing for you to do that to her than you'll ever know.  But we all know you don't swing that way.  Cari will survive with my memories."

Jake blushed harder, "Does she ever get embarrassed?"

Tony shook his head, "Not that I'm aware of, not when it comes to sex anyway."

I tossed them their clothes, "Davyn will be back sometime.  Get dressed, we have things to do anyway."

# Regrouping

When the scouts came back they reported to me and were surprised to see me with Tony's arm around my shoulder.  Desmond was in the worse place he could be.  He was with Brandon.  It was either a tactical advantage or he was a coward, I took favor with the later having known Desmond most of my life.  He was never overly brave but he was intelligent, though I don't put that into strategy, but with Desmond being the last remaining Lieutenant alive, it was a good plan.  However it made our lives more difficult.  There was also one disadvantage - I had taught Desmond, in a one and one fight he could be dangerous.

Ant and Ryan saw that we were with one of the scouts and came over.  They weren't overly surprised by the outcome, and they agreed it was going to be a harder battle.  Ant looked surprised to see me and Tony together.  Ryan jabbed him in the ribs and whispered to him.   He just grinned at me with a childish look on his face.

The scout ignored us and laid out all the information he'd discerned from his trip to Brandon's lair within what remained of the White House in Washington, DC.  Jesse and Tony and Davyn along with Taylor, Dom and Rick joined us.  They all listened and plotted and planned.  I listened to the whole thing.  The First Therians were the last to join us, claiming they had food in their teeth.  I laughed at the thought and everyone looked at me as if I hadn't been there.

Dom raised an eyebrow and questioned everything, "If she's the leader why isn't she speaking?"

Tony laughed, "She's not tactical as you'd like to think she is.  She's a risk taker, a guns a blazing type gal.  Unless you want the rest of your men dead, we will let her listen and then she can make her points when we have a plan."

"But if she's going to change it why are we making plans?"  Dom didn't look like changed much.

Tony explained, "She won't change it.  We'll work around what she ends up doing, which at this point it's going to be shadow walk to the nearest point."  Tony paused and pointed, "Here probably. Closest to Brandon.  She's not in a mercy mode so she'll not chase him, she'll use fear and intimidation and if he runs instead of cowers she'll light his backside on fire."  He laughed.

I smiled, "Couldn't have said it better myself."

Dom nodded, "So if she's guns a blazin then why do we need to go?"

Ryan giggled, "Have you ever had a plan go exactly right.  There are likely a billion vampires and humans with guns between that point and Brandon.  Not to mention traps and various other magical interferences.  He knows we are coming.  He'll do anything to take Cari down."

Dom nodded, "So we are the distraction basically?"

Ryan shook his head, "No we are all part of the plan, what Cari does is go for the kill.  She'll be the only one of us who can take Desmond or Brandon down.  Though anyone here can probably take Desmond down, but he could be better than last Cari saw him.  But we all have to have good mental shields with Desmond.  He can make you cower in fear with a mere thought or make you sing to the heavens your praise to him.  He can make you feel like doing anything."

I interrupted, "He's just as dangerous as Evangeline or Alec or Valentine.  They all use their talents to defend themselves.  And they all know how to do it well. They've been alive much longer than you or I."  And for me that is saying a lot.

Dom nodded and they continued their plotting and planning.  We were nearly ready.  I left after Dom had given up his concerns.  I had to do a part of the mission before everyone left.  The humans needed protection and Skylar and I had some work to do.

#Skylar

When I found Skylar she was crying.  I disliked crying but I offered her a tissue and she took it and looked up at me and burst out in tears even more.

I sat down next to her and she nearly fell over into my lap sobbing.  I patted and rubbed her back as she cried.  I didn't count the minutes until she settled down.  Most people would say I'm not patient, but sometimes you just had to wait, there was nothing you could do.

Skylar looked at me and wiped the last of the tears away, her voice was broken from the crying, "Davyn ended it with me."  She frowned and tears started to flow again.  "I'm sorry, but I blamed you, I told him I knew you'd ruin it for us."  Skylar's face grew red with anger, "He had the nerve to laugh at me and called me a petty fool.  He said you were nothing to him, and he wanted nothing to do with our bonds.  He dismissed me from his services and now I have no where to go."

I smiled, Skylar tried to run away, she must have thought I was mocking her but I caught her arm, "You have someplace to go.  You are the mother of Ryan's child.  You will always be welcome with us, Skylar."

She turned back at me and looked at me confused, "We lost the child when he severed the magic."

I sighed, "Either way, you are part of our family.  Children are lost, but bonds like that can't be broken."

She glared at me, "What would you know of it?  You break everything you touch."  Skylar fell to her knees in frustration and began crying again.  She sobbed, "I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that."

I rubbed her hands, "It's okay.  You are family.  Jesse's clan banished him because he wanted to have a Caestus.  Henry left his clan because he didn't believe they were right.  Nicola is like a daughter to me.  All three are family and they have no direct time to my blood line.  They are family."  I stood up and took Skylar's hands  and pulled her up.  "Family is stronger than clan.  It is not about blood, it is thicker than that."

Skylar looked across at me with large wondrous eyes, "I never thought of you having such a large heart."

I smiled, "I'm full of surprises."

Skylar laughed and wiped the tears away again.  "We hardly know each other, yet you'd take me in?"

I nodded, "I can't explain it, but it's the right thing to do.  Davyn has lost a lot, you on the other hand have gained an entire family who will not desert you, even if they disagree with you."

Skylar turned around and saw Tony watching.  She hurridly wiped away the tears and tried to make herself presentable.  He smiled at us, "I take that's meant for me too."

I smiled.  Skylar looked back at me, "He's the reason Davyn is pissed off at you."

I nodded, "Davyn wanted something I could not give him, something you couldn't give him.  Tony made him realize it and he broke the bonds."

Skylar frowned, "He broke your's too?"

Tony smiled, "Yeah, it wasn't a pretty scene when she felt it.  But it coincided rather well I think."

I shook my head, "You would think so."

He laughed, "You thought so at the time too."  He wrapped his arms around us.  "Skylar, she'll protect you forever or for as long as you want to be part of it.  She'll love you even if you hate her.  Davyn isn't worth crying over."  Tony kissed the top of her head and pecked me on the cheek.  "I hate to be the bearer of pushiness, but we need those crystals.  Skylar, can you do them with out Cari?"

Skylar laughed, "And she's supposed to be the poignant one."  She sighed in mock frustration, "Yeah, it would go faster with her though."

I asked, "Why?"

Tony smiled as he took a necklace from out of his pocket,  and put it around Skylar's neck.  "We need you to make these?"

I nodded and smiled as Tony took the necklace off Skylar and she reappeared.  She giggled, "Did I really disappear?"

Tony smiled.  "Yes, you did, we want to make more.  Aurora says we can all pitch in but our best fighters need you to make theirs.  And I want one of yours, far better than my measly shadow."

I started to ask what we were going to make the necklaces out of but tony handed me a bunch of small chains they found in the jewelry shop around the corner.  "Will this do?"

I laughed, "Yes."  I kissed him and it took us both all of our will power to pull away from one another.

Skylar and I worked as quickly at our projected tasks.  Skylar worked on the crystals for the humans. I doubted they had the will power to maintain their emotions with Desmond.  These crystals would absorb the power directed at them.  Hopefully it would be enough.  

I worked on the necklaces with the help of Aurora and Ant.  Tony decided he wasn't strong enough to work more than the few he had.  I was very interested in this part of the plan.

We worked for what seemed like hours, and we hoped we had made enough for all of the humans going with us.  This was the last battle. We needed everyone doing their part.

#Material Possessions

Day came and Davyn found us still working on our little projects.

He looked horrible.  Skylar glared at him.  Aurora took her away, they had done enough, "Come honey, let's catch some Zs."  Aurora glared at Davyn as well but she turned and ushered Skylar out.  Ant stood just behind me with his father.  It felt extremely awkward to have them just an inch behind me as if I was the that needed protecting.  But they weren't protecting me, they were ready to fight if it came to it.

Davyn raises his hands to signal he meant no threat to any of us.  He didn't smile, but there was a little joy in his eyes, "I come with good tidings."  Davyn handed me a rather large nugget of some metal I had never seen before in my life.  But after closer inspection I realized exactly what it was.  "You still mean to help us?"

Davyn frowned, "I made you a promise, have you taken your promise back?"

I shook my head, "No I will protect those of New Haven with my life if necessary."

He smiled, "Then yes, I still mean to help.  Though the rest of our bargains are off."

I shrugged, "Fine with me.  How much of this do you have?"

"There is a limited supply but if you can mine it you can have it.  It's just useless metal to us.  But while you worked with Skylar," he frowned, "I had some of my people mine up a few buckets full."

I blinked in surprise.  "Buckets?"

He nodded with a smile, "Did you get your forge done?"

Ant laughed, "Of course we did."  Ant elbowed his father, "We've been waiting for this joker here to make up his mind."

Tony elbowed his son back and they had a fun shoving match behind me.  How becoming.  Davyn sniggered at them.

Two of Davyn's vampires walked into the room and put four buckets of this precious metal at my feet.  We could do a lot with that.  I looked at them, "They will be crude in the time we have but they will work."

Ant was already off carrying two buckets.  He was headed to the forge and to the book that we would need to finalize the pieces.  I offered Davyn my hand, "Still friends."

He surveyed me before taking my hand, "Friends."

Tony picked up the remaining buckets and we left Davyn's company and made our way to the forge they had built only weeks before.

#Forging On

By the time Tony and I had made it to the warehouse we called home, Ant and Ryan were already heating the forge.  That would take the longest time, but they knew what they were doing.

People came out of the wood work.  Dom, Rick and Taylor came bearing crystals.  Taylor spoke for them, "We want one too.  We'll give up our alottment of cyrstals to to do it with."

I smiled, "No need to give them up.  But I will make some for your most skilled hunters.  Ya'll are going to go back to killing us, and I don't want you killing us with our own magic."

Dom and Rick frowned but nodded.  "Then only the three of us and Annabeth."

I looked confused, "That's all you consider the best."

The boys all looked sheepish.  I turned to Ant and Ryan, "What have ya'll been plotting?"

Tony stepped in between them.  "While you were busy, we were talking."  He paused as if he were trying to find the right words.  He took a step back, "Ryan and I can't kill you with out killing our selves.  Our own self preservation could kick in.  Ant is your son, he says he could.  We all say we can, but can we really in the end kill you?"

I understood, "So you want to train hunters to kill me.  Humans are just going to die, and then we'll have to start all over again."

Taylor shook his head, "We'd agree to be taken as LESSER Chevalier.  Live forever tied to you, be trained by you to become the best damned hunters in the world, and if we have to kill you.  It's a goal we all wish for.  Why wouldn't we take them up on the offer."

Dom guffawed.  "She won't accept it.  Why would anyone want to train someone to kill themselves?  That's why she trained those closest to her."

"If that's what you all want to do, I'm game."

Dom's jaw dropped.  Apparently he really thought I was that person.  

I slit my wrist and Annabeth was the first, I hadn't seen her hiding behind the men when she came in.  She smiled up at me brightly.  I took her wrist and bit softly and she tentatively drank my blood.  

_Your blood to my heart.
My blood to to your heart.
Together to bind us._

I felt Annabeth in my mind and she stared up at me with awe and glee.  She was excited to find out my weaknesses.  When the others joined her only Taylor was reserved in his eagerness.   Dom and Rick were nearly falling over with glee.  I had to block the three of them before they overwhelmed me with the eagerness to kill me.

Tony laughed.  I looked at him, Annabeth asked, "What's so funny?"

"You all want to kill her so bad, you are giddy with joy.  Not only does she feel it radiating from you,"  tony gestured to the air around him, "it's all in your mind, the only thing on your mind coming through.  She just blocked ya'll out so she could function."

Ryan smiled, "We'll teach you how to control your feelings so the connection is always open.  But we have work to do."

The rest of the day we spent forging coins for various vampires and humans.  Tony was first in line.  He smiled back at me as we cemented the coins to his magic.  He just banished himself from his own clan.  He really did love me, my heart swooned and skipped a beat.  Tony laughed at me with fondness and I punched him in the arm.  He laughed harder.  It felt wonderful to have him back.  I didn't quite know what to do with myself.

Jesse was next in line.  He only wanted one and he looked sad.  I pulled him down and laid a passionate kiss on his lips.  He licked his lips when he stood up and glanced over at his brother.  Tony nodded his acceptance.  Jesse didn't know what to do.   I pushed him out of line.  "You are done!"  He laughed and went on his way to play with his new toy.

Dom, Rick, Taylor and Annabeth were next in line and theres were a little harder to do with the gem but it worked in the end.  Ant, Tony and Ryan helped them pick up their new skills.  

Throughout the day, their little class grew in numbers as we exhausted all the metal that Davyn had brought out of his mines for us.  There were only a few unused pieces left when Davyn came to the forge.  

"Do you want one?"

Davyn nodded, "If there are any left."

I nodded and forged one last piece before I fell to the ground exhausted from all the magic work I had done the past hours.

Davyn caught me before I hit the ground.  He handed me to Tony who promptly offered me his wrist.  I took enough so I could finish Davyn's Caestus.  And then leaned into Tony and he easily lifted me into his arms and carried me away.  I sank into him.  I felt his heart beat, his power and fell asleep in his arms.

We slept on our plans and the scouts would report to us before dawn.  Our plan was to begin as the sun rose above the horizon and free our nation and the world from the vampire reign that plagued it now, all because I did not kill Brandon and Valence nearly two decades ago.

# The Last Battle

The baubles were made, the plans were changed to include everything we had just done.  Everyone knew what they were supposed to do and it still would not go as planned.  Things never went as planned in war or much of anything I ever did.  Free will had a large hand in everything we did and this was no different.  Brandon and Desmond could do something we didn't expect.  Or we could have a traitor in our mists.  Nothing was certain, other than the fact that we were going to do this at first light.

Dawn came quickly for most.  They'd spent too much time celebrating.  That was the way with all wars, the soldiers needed that little bit of fun to think about going to their deaths.  I knew we'd have losses.  I knew we'd all lose friends.  We would all hurt when this was over, but it was a necessity if we wanted our freedom back.

Ant was going with Dimitri and the Therians to prepare our escape route.  Tony, half the hunters and citizens of New Haven who volunteered were going to free the humans that were being held in DC as cattle.  Francesco was taking more vampires to the opposite side of the compound and Donatello took more to the front gate.  While myself, Ryan, and the remaining hunters and the elite forces of the Therians and vampires shadowed into the middle of the compound.

It was all about timing and throwing the enemy off guard.  Five simultaneous attacks while most vampires slept that was the plan.  

Once things started we wouldn't know what was happening with the remaining part of the plan.  We had to hope everything was going smoothly.  The walk into the White House was easy but once we were in guns were firing in every direction.  Some of the hunters dropped, but most hid behind the vampires and Therians with us.  We moved quickly in the direction Brandon was.  Desmond would either be with him or not, it didn't matter.  Once the head was cut off the better off we'd be.  That was our job.  Desmond would be icing on the cake.

The farther we got into the building the more silver was being used.  I felt the sting of silver in the bullet wounds.  And we started to lose vampires and Therians alike.  But we kept going.  I cut down men and vampires with my swords.  We broke necks and pushed and fought our way through the halls.  We left a bloody path behind us.

Brandon was dangerous we all knew that.  We could never catch him. He seemed always one step ahead of us.  We had gone through almost all of the corridors tracking Brandon until it was only Ryan and I left.  We clung to the hopes we'd kill him, but that was also when we started to see Brandon flee the area.  He had been spying on us with our own men.  Ryan and I were not so easy to use like that.  We finally had a leg up.

Everything was such a blur of movement.  Hours could have past, and it could have been mere minutes.  Everything was moving so quickly there was little time to think beyond the initial goal - kill Brandon.  Brandon's men had all but been exhausted; with all our losses they took their own as well.  Brandon was surrounded by fewer and fewer of his men as we took them down.

We finally had Brandon cornered, we'd tracked him into a storage room; he'd thought was something else apparently.  He throw flames at us that Ryan's bauble absorbed and with the new found power Ryan drew dual flaming swords and he rushed Brandon.  With a fling of his hand Ryan flew to the wall cracking his head hard and slumping to the ground.

Brandon laughed, "You forget what I am."

I shook my head, "No I did not."  And in one moment, one fleeting moment, Brandon screamed in agony as his body and clothes leapt into flames.  Brandom furiously fought the elements, but he was not adept in that side of things.  While his body burned Brandon tried to break into my mind.  He tried to pry his way past my shields.  He tried to control me, tried to stop me in the only way he knew how.  

I could feel the pain radiating from him. He was burning alive and healing all at the same time.  But he couldn't stop either, he burned and I fought back the urge to vomit then and there.  Brandon pulled out a gun and I could hear the hissing of his hand burning against the excessively hot metal.  He pointed it at me and the flash of the muzzle was the last sight I saw before I flew across the room.  I heard the distinct sound of silver scorching tissue.  I didn't look back, I gathered my senses quickly before Brandon could turn the gun upon me again.  In a movement quicker than the human eye could see I sliced cleanly through Brandon's neck.  Blood gushed everywhere as he head toppled from his body.  The flames continued to burn with out any hindrance and there was little left of Brandon Holt by the time I turned around to see Tony lying on the ground in a heap.  

# In The End

The battle raged on but I was stuck in a moment in time.  Tony had saved my life and if we didn't move quickly the silver bullet to his brain could mean a very serious injury he would never recover from.  

I picked up Tony and Ryan and found the nearest shadow to go to our rendezvous point.  I could only hope that we'd have a doctor of some sort there.  I was still in shock when we appeared in the mist of our allies.  They cheered and yelled as the enemy was fleeing.  They had felt the loss of their commander.  

From the middle of the crowd a familiar voice echoed in my head.  "Cari, I never thought I'd see you again."  Eve laughed, "But then again you are more resilient that I had ever thought."  She took Tony from my dead mans carry and laid him on the ground.  She immediately went to work.  I don't think I was more happy to see anyone else at that moment.  

Ryan roused and I gave him a hug.  He stared at me in confusion until he saw Tony lying next to him.  He sighed and hugged me back.  "It'll be okay, Doc is here now.  She'll take care of him."

And she did.  Tony should make a full recovery if he ever wakes up.

This beloved country would never be the same.  Vampires were common knowledge know, there was no going back.  The state of our world was in shambles and it would be years before the good ole U S of A would be back up to it's prior existence, if it ever managed that.  For now we go on living with what our life brings.  We can only hope that it will lead to a better tomorrow.
