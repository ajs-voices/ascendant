# Unexpected Visitor

As music started to play the general level of noise increased. Parties were not my favorite things in the world.  Truly I did not like them.  I stood in a corner of the community center.  Someplace I could be seen, but not bothered.  Ant and Ryan sat at a table in front of me.  They chatted and spoke and many people came to sit with them.  They were a barrier between me and the world.  It was such a fine line that few dared cross it, all those except the ones that were close to me.  Nicola and Henry came to talk with me a couple of times through the night.  They were glad to see Henry's family from the Giovanni clan.  I was glad they didn't take his banishment as a sign to bar him from their presence like his father did.

Tony never once came to me, he danced with his daughters and spoke with Ant and Ryan, but he never even looked my way.  I think he was mad at me for having picked up someone new so quickly.  No matter the reasons he would never understand it.  He didn't understand me well enough to understand anything of what I do.  I hurt but there was nothing I could do.  We needed to move on and get past everything that had happened in the past.  Watching Tony with the girls made my heart ache, they would never know their father.  If for anything, I'd hope that Tony would understand the father figure in their lives was necessary.  Ryan and Ant can't always be that for the children.

Nick and Jake were still adjusting.  Jake took to staring at Tony and Tony never realized what was going on.  He'd look at Jake and then look away as if he'd not even seen the man watching him with lustful eyes.  It was time to do something about it.  I moved away from my safety zone with Ryan and Ant staring after me, I could feel their eyes on my back.

I took Jake by the hand and smiled, "Come on."

Tony was still on the dance form with Morgan and Carissa.  The girls hugged my legs when I walked up to them.  "Daddy's teaching us to dance."

I smiled.  "I'm so happy for you.  Is he a good teacher?"  

Carissa smiled, "The best."

I hugged the girls, "That's great.  Can I talk with Daddy for a few minutes?  I'm sure Ryan or Ant would love to dance with you two."  They giggled and nodded their acceptance and ran off to find the men they so adored.  

Tony stared at me with fire in his eyes.  I ignore him.  "Tony, this is Jake."    I put Jake's hand in Tony's, "Jake is Tristan's brother.  He's seen you from Tristan's eyes.  He wants to get to know you."

Tony glared at me, "I don't like men.  You know this."

I laughed, "You didn't say that to Tristan.  You need to have a discussion with Jake.  Not me.  He likes you.  He's seen more of you than you'll ever know.  Maybe he can help you control your temper when it comes to me being that both of you are empaths."

I walked away I could feel Tony's glare on my back.  He hated me.  And right now I didn't care.

Nick stopped in front of me, "I hope that doesn't hurt Jake."

"Well it's better he hurt him now than Jake pine over him forever.  Jake's a Therian he'll live a long time with that.  At least if it's over he'll know."  I leaned in to Nick and whispered, "But between you and me, I think they'll hit it off.  Tony needs a new 'wife'.  Someone to love him and he to love without all my baggage."

Nick laughed and put his arms around my waist.  I obliged him and put my arms around his neck.  He pulled me close to his body.  I could smell the blood in his veins.  I could feel his desire.  The one problem with being near an empath is that a mere touch can mean so much more than from anyone else.  Nick whispered in my ear, "No one ever reacts to me like you do."

I know I had explained it to him before but now was not the time to explain it again.  Instead I buried my head in his chest, taking in his scent and keeping my mind on him, rather than him as food.

We danced, if you could call it that for a while.  No one bothered me, well not no one because someone did interrupt us in the end.  Jesse came to us he put his hand on my arm and pulled me into his embrace.  Nick didn't glare at him but he didn't have a friendly look either.  I looked up at Jesse and I could see the fear and pain in his eyes.  Something was wrong.  I put my hands on his face and it gave Jesse the opening he wanted.  He stabbed me in the chest with a silver knife, he barely missed my heart.  

I slowly slide to the knees still propped up against Jesse.  Someone screamed and then there was a mass panic.  It really was a miracle we were not trampled in the mist of it.  In moments the community hall was empty except a few souls.  Jesse had collapsed nearly on top of me.  If he had hit my heart I would have been down for the count, but I could still move, the initial shock over.  I cradled Jesse's face in my hands and that's when I felt Virgil's presence.  I managed to mutter, "The dream walker."

Ryan put his hand on my shoulder and I felt a sudden surge of energy.  I pushed my shields over Jesse.  I spoke in broken sentences.  "Get... book... bag... quickly."

I saw Nick run off in the direction of my belongings.  Hopefully he'd find it.  I prayed he would. 

Ryan let go and I felt weaker.  He sighed and he put his hands on my shoulder again.  I felt better.  

"Kill ... him... now",  was all I managed to get out.  My energy was slowly slipping away.  Ant pulled Ryan away, "Davyn thinks Skylar can take your place.  We need you."

I nodded.  "Yes.  Go.  Fine."

Ryan let go and Skylar quickly touched my shoulder.  She wasn't nearly as strong as Ryan but it would help no matter what.  "Kill him... trapped here."

Ryan nodded and Tony, Ant and Ryan slipped off into the shadows to find the Dream Walker and slay him while he was trapped in Jesse's body.  I only hoped I had the strength to keep him here.  Davyn touched my other shoulder and the surge of power leaped and I knew then that we would take down the Dream Walker.

Davyn asked, "What's in the book?"

I still could barely speak with the dagger in my chest, "Spell."

Skylar let go and the power barely diminished.  She pulled the dagger from my chest.  Nick arrived with the book.  Skylar spoke to him softly and then Nick offered me his wrist.  I drank willingly. I needed the blood to heal the wound.  

I felt better with just that little bit of help from Skylar and Nick, it would take much more to heal, but it was a start.  "Flip halfway through and then halfway again.  Take the middle portion and flip halfway again.  In the section towards the end you will find a spell with a sigil next it."

Skylar and Nick flipped through the book and I could feel Virgil struggling in Jesse.  He was pounding against my shields.  I hoped Jesse would survive this.  Skylar turned the book to me, "Is this it?"

I nodded.  "Yes, when they get back we must do the spell, to vanquish his soul forever and relieve Jesse of his possession."

Davyn asked, "You mean he could stay there indefinitely?"

I nodded, "Virgil is not the first host the Dream walker has possessed.  He has lived many lives in many hosts.  He is not First nor primeval but he is older than old."

Minutes passed and then what felt like hours before they returned with the news.  Ryan nodded.  "We beheaded his body and burnt it.  Here is his head.  You can burn it."

I smiled, Ryan knew how to bring the proof required.  Skylar helped me prepare the spell.  She cut the sigil into the palm of my hand.  I placed it on Jesse's cheek and I poured my power into him through the sigil.  The chant was a simple latin phrase which translated loosely to "leave this body".  The embodiment of what was Virgils soul evaporated from Jesse's mind.  He was alone and he collapsed into my arms.  He had very little strength left, but the dream walker was dead.  

I thought about the Dream walker's head and it leapt into flames.  Ryan dropped it quickly to the ground where it burned.  He laughed.  He knew it wouldn't hurt him, but he still dropped it anyway.  It didn't necessarily go according to plan but two out of the remaining three council members were the only thing left standing in our say to Brandon's destruction.
