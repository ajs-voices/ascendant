# Legends

I stepped out into the shadows in the place between worlds.  I froze.  "Girls, don't move."  We did not move. 

I saw shadows moving.  I heard a wolf howl, and other feline growls low on the earth.  Then I heard, "Hold",  Tony came out of the forest at a run.  He saw me and he stopped dead in his tracks, he was crying I could see his tears in the moonlight.

Carissa pinched me.  And I smiled I let the shadow's drop from the girls and Tony covered his mouth in disbelief.  He was still crying but they were happy tears.

Out of the hut came a woman who I remembered, she was older.  Thea was smiling at me as she touched the barrier and it fell.  I got far away from the circle and said, "Put it back up."  

She nodded, "Already doing so Cari.  By the goddess we thought you were all dead."

I looked at Tony and he was still crying.  I pulled the girls harnesses off of me and set them down.  Carissa ran to her father, and Tony picked her up and wrapped his arms around her.  

Thea smiled at me, "He's been a wreak since he got here."

Morgan grabbed my hand and pulled me towards Tony.  Tony picked her up and hugged her too.  I smiled and watched him bond with the girls.  "You know they are both your's right?"

He looked at me confused.  "That was the problem wasn't it.  They both had primeval DNA.  I don't have any."  

Tony tried to put it together.  I smiled, "Valence or Tristan made the whole thing up.  Tristan couldn't have been the father any more than I could bear a human child.  That night, Tristan didn't finish in any place he could get me pregnant."

Tony put the girls down and pulled me in close and he hugged us all.  We returned the hug.   

We held each other for several moments.  I pulled away, "Ryan?  Mia?"

Tony smiled, "Both are safe.  Ryan is Ant's Chevalier, and Mia is Damian's, neither could not be tied to a vampire.  They felt very alone.  It's been an adjustment for all of us."

He looked at me, "What did you do?"

I shrugged, "I couldn't let you guys die if I died."

He hugged me again.  "How are you?"

I sighed, "Alone.  It's strange.  But that's okay.  I'll be okay.  My hunger is not here either."

Eve stepped out of the shadows, "I can explain that one.  Your little ones here, they've been feeding you, I don't know what they are doing, but when the three of you are together, you feed each other, no blood needed, nothing just the circle of touch."

"How long have I been out of it?"  I motioned to the girls.

Tony sighed, "5 years, 2 months and 3 days."

Eve smiled, "We have a lot to discuss."

I looked over at Eve, "Can it wait until tomorrow.  I want to spend time with my family."

She smiled, "Sure, I didn't think you'd want to be left in the dark that long, it's the only reason I said anything."

I nodded, "I've been asleep for 5 years.  I missed Tony. I missed all of my family."  I wrapped my arms around the girls and Tony.  

We sat in a family hug as people came to use and expressed their happiness.  Ryan and Ant were happy in their pairing. 

Ryan confided in me, "It's not so hard as being with you.  There's no back flow of pain or anxiety."  

I smiled, "I'm happy for you.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you what I was planning."

He hugged me, "If you told me what you were doing I'd have stopped you.  I loved being your Chevalier."

I nodded, "But now you don't have to worry about killing yourself when you have to kill me."

He looked at me with sorrow, "Yeah.  But I hope that day never comes."

I smiled back at him, "Me either."

Ant hugged me, "It's good to have you back.  I've been trying to help Dad through this, but I don't have the experience."

"You called him Dad?"  It sounded strange coming from Ant.

He laughed, "We've bonded.  I won't call you Mom though if that's alright with you."

I smiled, "I gave you permission long ago to stop calling me Mom, you don't have to start again."  

He nodded, "We still need you, me and Ry.  We aren't leaving just because you don't hold him Chevalier.  We are all family regardless of our ties."

"I wouldn't expect you to go, if that wasn't what you wished. You know that.  You can come and go as you please."

He hugged me again, "Good glad that's settled.  We've got some teaching to do I'll see you later."

I nodded and the girls waved.  Ant smiled brightly at his sisters.  Tony nodded and we were left alone again for a few moments.

Thea sat down with us.  "I know you want to deal with all this later, but this you must know now."

Tony looked down, and Thea frowned, "He won't tell you.  But I will.  Tristan still lives."

"What?" I stood up in shock.

Thea pulled my hand to sit down beside her.  "Tony?"  He shook his head.  Thea continued, "When you broke the bonds of Chevalier, and you severed your tie to him.  He was distraught.  But Tristan survived.  He saved him for you to kill.  But more importantly to make Tony your Chevalier in the process."

Tony muttered softly, "I can't live without you."

I moved next to Tony and hugged him the best I could without getting in his lap.

Thea put her hand on mine, "But he's not the man you knew or the man you killed, he's an animal, a beast, there is nothing inside him.  Nothing!"  She looked at me, "May I?"

I raised an eye brown but nodded.  She placed her hand on my forehead and a smile grew across her face.  Whatever she was doing she was happy.  "Tristan is dead.  What is left is of you.  Your punishment was removed."

"Her what?"  Tony nearly snapped her head off he was so flustered.

Thea smiled, "Our legends of Il Cane della Morte speak of her punishment."

Tony sighed, "Wait there are legends of her in your culture."

I laughed, "What do you expect when I'm over 800 years old."

He tilted his head in the I see your point way he did.  It was endearing.  Thea continued, "My family back in the old world, found Il Cane in a sacred place, she was looking for understanding."

I interrupted, "I was searching for tomes lost to my people.  My sources lead me to Thea's people's burial site."

Thea smiled, "Understanding.  My grandmother of old read Il Cane from afar and saw great evil and great potential.  Which is why she tied the two of you together years later, but that's later."  She smiled, "I'm getting ahead of myself.  Il Cane already served the earth.  But she used her powers for evil.  So the earth punished her.  Or so the legend goes."  

"When Il Cane killed the village, it was her death sentence from earth. "  She looked at Tony, "A man of great love and understanding saved Il Cane.  He saw the potential in her and he nursed Il Cane back to health.   And Il Cane's deed from that day forward protected the earth.  It is why we bonded you together."

"Tristan holds the punishment."  She looked at me.  "The earth will receive your punishment in lieu of your death."  Thea looked up to the heaven and she closed her eyes, "And the heavens and the earth shall bind them together forever."

I watched Thea praying to her gods, when she finished I smiled, "And that means?"

"Thank you for waiting.  It means, that Chevalier can come from your punishment, but only because the earth is accepting the remnants of your punishment as a soul."

I nodded.  "When can we do it then?"

Thea smiled, "We have more coming who want Chevalier.  They are nearly here, we should wait."

I looked at Tony, "We can wait?"

He nodded.  Thea stood up and then took each of the girl's hands.  "Let's leave your Mommy and Daddy alone for a few moments.  We've some people who are dying to meet you two."

I nodded and they went easily with Thea.  

Tony stood up and I followed, he lead me into the forest where talked after I'd been woken up after 12 years.
