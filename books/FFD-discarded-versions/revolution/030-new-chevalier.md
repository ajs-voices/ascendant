# New Chevalier

Ant smiled at me, "News spreads like wildfire these days.  Probably a good thing most people believe you are dead huh?"  I smiled back, "I was told to come see if you strong enough to inspect the troops."

Francesco smiled, "Before any become lesser and then more, you have to approve pairings, in any way you see fit."

I sighed but looked up at Eve before she left with the girls.  She nodded, "I'm surprised you even asked."

Tony laughed, "She's not stupid Doc.  Speaking of Doc, Eve, you like Cari's bite right?"

Eve blushed.  Tony smiled and continued, "She needs to start a new family, Il Mandria di Cane, needs to be replenished.  She can't go on like she has been.  She can't hunt, and she won't ask for food."  Tony wrote on a piece of paper, "She'll pay you this yearly."  

Eve blinked, "And if money doesn't come back into play?"

"Then we'll work out some other form of compensation."

"Why me?"  She asked.

"You are a doctor of course; you see she gets herself into a lot of trouble.  You'd be able to add to your knowledge with more schooling, you'd be able to do any research you like other than curing vampirism."  

She looked at me, "And Therianthropy?"

I smiled, "That's fine."

"Okay.  Sounds like a good proposal for giving you a few pints of blood a week."  She blushed, "Always like that?"

"If you want it that way."

"Would I feed him?"

Tony spoke first, "No.  I don't partake of her family unless there is dire need."

"Yeah, I'll go with okay.  What do I have to do?"  Eve was curious.

"We'll do it after the ceremony has been done for everyone else.  We don't want you caught with me forever if you don't want it."  I looked around for something to wear.  Aurora handed me a bag with clothes in it.  

Eve looked a bit relieved.  "Okay.  I'll go run those tests now.  You can go play inspector."

I sighed as I pulled out the clothes.  Aurora had chosen well.  She smiled at me, "My step son over there picked it out, not me."  I raised my eye brow at her in question.  "Franky proposed and we got married while you slept."  I looked shocked I could tell from her smile, "Marie is happily seeing some human.  Everyone's happy."

I pulled the gown off and Francesco turned to walk out with disgust.  Aurora laughed, "He's such a prude."  She left with him.

I got dressed quickly and followed Francesco and Aurora to the new training center in the heart of the compound.

I stopped just shy of the doorway.  I took a deep breath and walked through the door followed by Tristan, Tony, Ant and Ryan.  Ryan kissed my cheek as he passed, "Good to have you back."

Ryan stepped in front of the men and women waiting.  "You've been training for a while.  Today you get to show your stuff.  Prove you can do what she says."  He pointed to me.  "And work together and you get to keep your pairings for life."

In the mix of people in front of me I saw Dimitri and Damian.  I was surprised to see Aurora and Francesco in formation as well.  Tristan and Tony fell in line together with Alex.  Ryan and Ant stood in front of the room and called out instructions.  I got to sit back and watch the class.  

And with a start they started working in their warm ups, all in unison.  Everything was perfectly in unison.  I watched for deviations but it was boring.  I looked bored Ant came over to me.  "I know I'm sorry, but we don't want them to get hurt."  

Ten minutes later they were standing in their pairings in two lines facing one another.  I had to stop them.  "Ryan, I can't watch them all at the same time."  

Ryan shouted, "First pairing, the rest fall back and watch.  Unless you all think you can take her on." 

There was an eager cheer.  They wanted to get hurt it seemed.

"Rules?" I asked.

"Don't kill them,"  Ant laughed. 

"How do you win?"  

He nodded, "Ah.  He handed me a pair of wraps.  Killing blow.  This marks every hit you land.  Ry and I'll watch for killing blows."

I nodded and got up from the wall.  "Can I choose who I want to try first?"

Ryan laughed, "Yeah sure."

I looked over at the threesome I had tied to me through metaphysics.  They smiled.  "On guard."

Murmurs ran through the class, "She's not even warming up."  "Of course she picked them."

Ryan spoke over the class, "You all wonder why she choose her family first?"  They all said yes.  "Anyone care to enlighten them."

Aurora spoke up, "Because they are going to be the hardest to beat.  They can feel what she feels, and if they understand the link they share, they can read her."

Ryan nodded, "They won't beat her.   Not together anyway.  They've a lot yet to learn, but they will be the most challenging."

Someone in the class yelled, "Is that a bet?  Three on one, I'll take those odds."  More chimed in.  I sighed, then threw my first punch that landed in Tony's gut.  He humphed and then the room was silent.  And the fight was on.

They men circled me in the same direction.  They took turns advancing trying to land a blow I easily dodged.  They bumped into each other a few times.  I kicked Tristan in the stomach and he flew across the room.  I smacked Alex across the head and he fell to the ground in pain.  Ryan and Ant called them dead at least out for the rest of the fight.  Tony smiled at me and he came at me with full force, he didn't trip over them anymore.

Ryan spoke over the cheering, "She just took out his weakest links. Do you want to see the fight?  Or try yourself?"

A chorus of fights went across the room.  It was a playful fight.  I could feel Ryan wanting to get in on it.  Ant was wanting a piece of the action as well. They wanted the fight.  I smiled and nodded to them.  And they jumped to their feet.  The three circled me like they'd done it a million times before.  They worked together before.  They'd fought me before and none had won.  

An hour went by and no one had landing a killing blow.  The rules had changed the moment they stepped into the ring.  It was death by broken neck, we all knew the rules.  Ant went down first when he got too close to me.  Ryan was felled by his own momentum and I snapped his neck with ease.  Tony was left standing.  He bowed out.  I nodded and the fight was over.

Aurora asked, "Why bow out?"

"Someone needs to continue with the class.  Unless you want to put this off?"  Aurora shook her head.

Tony called out "Next."  The two in front of the line attacked and Tony yelled at me over the crowd.  "Don't kill them."

They bum-rushed me and I laid my hands on either side of the first man and he was called out, the other I caught with my knee and brought his buddy over his back which would have snapped it had it been for real.  He was called out.

Another attacked and they lost, one after the other they tried to beat me.  It became chaos.  I stood up and pressed my power out and stopped everyone dead in their tracks.

Ant groggily spoke, "She's had enough of the one on one attacks.  This is a team exercise. Ya'll have a lot to learn."

I walked out of the room, "They all pass."  I was tired of their games.
