# The Runt

We sat on the creek edge in silence.  The birds and the crickets chirped in harmony with the base of the bull frog crocks.  The creek still babbled in the silence.  I laid my head on his shoulder and held his hand with both of mine.  It was good to be near him.  This time it felt different waking up, than it had before.  Tony and I were in a real relationship this time.  We'd loved each other for almost all of our lives but the last five years were different.  I don't know how I would have handled this without him.  I whispered, "I'm sorry I wasn't here for you."

Tony wrapped his arm around me and pulled me close.  "It's not your fault."

I poked him in the ribs, "Besides I know you probably had a little tart to keep you company."  I smiled up at him, but when he glared at me he was a little angry until he saw me smiling at him. 

He rolled his eyes and laughed softly and pulled me closer.  "I did.  I wasn't looking for someone, she just came to me.  She tried to make me get over you."  He frowned and looked down, "I think it was just the sex I liked."

I smiled and wrapped my arms around him and hugged him, "Sex isn't about love for everyone."

He looked at me, "I know you think that.  I know you mean it when you say you don't care who I'm with.  But I care.  Sex is not just about sex for me."

"And with her it was just sex?"  I asked cautiously.

He nodded, "She needed me."  I waited for him to continue.  He looked down at me and smiled then looked away again with a blush, "She's a Therian.  She hadn't been with anyone like her, she was afraid of being with a man.  She hurt someone she loved.  And with me she could be herself."

"And they say I adapt to what people want."  I hugged him.  "Tony,"  I put my hand on cheek and got him to look at me, "don't be embarrassed by the choices you make when I'm not there.  Love her, Fuck her, make love to her, I don't care.  What we have is different.  You have my complete trust, not many people can say that."

He smiled, "I know.  And I want you back in here."  He pointed to his head.  "Please let me be your Chevalier again."  He pleaded with me.  "I know why you did it.  Thank you for caring, but it's not what I want.  I want you back."

"If that's what you want."  I smiled and unwound myself from him and sat facing him on his lap.  I wrapped my legs around his waist and he smiled at me.  I kissed him, "I'll be whatever you need me to be."

We kissed and the passion rose.  Tony laid back and pulled me with him.  I could feel things rising for both of us.  Out of nowhere a girl ran over top of us.  I quickly pulled my swords in the direction that she'd come from.  She raced around a tree, but when she saw my swords drawn in the opposite direction she took refuge behind me.  Tony was standing beside me with his gun drawn.  He'd changed to something with more distance and more modern.  I smiled at him but there was little time for much more than that as a pack of burly men raced at us.

A man on a lectica followed behind them carried by four even burlier men than the pack in front of us.  I hadn't seen a lectica in many hundreds of years.  But here one was in the middle of n where.  

A large booming voice came from the large man on the lectica.  "Hold."  He was talking to his people, they all held in their places, even those rushing at us."

The litter bearers put the lectica on the ground and one let the large man use him as a stepping stool.  How archaic were these people?

He walked towards me, I pointed one sword at him and held the other to the left Tony was on my right.  He laughed at me.  "Give me back the runt."

I looked down at the girl hiding behind me and then back to him.  He was closer.  "What has she done?"

He frowned and glared at me for not being obedient.  He didn't know me and for that I was thankful.  "She has stolen from my table.  I demand blood for the theft."

If that's all he wanted, I pulled my swords across each wrist and let the blood flow from them on to the already wet ground.  "You have blood."

He glared at me and at the ground and then turned his gaze upon me in fury.  He lifted his hand and the men started to advance on us.

I smiled and put the sword in my left hand away and then picked up the little girl.  She clung to me with all the remaining strength in her body and I felt her power.  She was Therian.  I reached out to the men circling us, waiting for the command to attack, with my power and I felt their distinct resonance back, they were all Therian.  

The fat man dropped his hand and the men ran at us with lightning quick speed.  I put the girl down and sheathed my other sword.  I raised my hands and the men stopped.  They heeded my powers.  I smiled at the fat man and he glared at me.  

He urged his men on, I could feel his power rising.  They stayed put.  I gave him a smirk.  I was taunting him to try more.  He took up the sword at his side and he charged at me.  I pulled the girl to the side and we danced away from him.  Tony picked up the girl and backed out of the circle of men.  He knew I wanted this fight.  My body ached for a decent fight, though I didn't think this one would be all the challenging.  

With my left hand I taunted him to come again.  You could see the anger getting the better of him as his face reddened.  He attacked me and I parried easily.  We danced for a few moments and he dropped to his knees out of breathe.  He truly was a fat man.  I felt his power rise and he started to change.  

I smiled, nothing could be worse for him.  His bones cracked and snapped, he howled in pain.  The men around him started to change.  In seconds I was surrounded by wolves.  The girl was clawing at Tony, she was fighting the call to change.  I closed my eyes and I tried to calm her.   I was strong in three things, Animal Ken was my third strongest power.  She yielded her fight and she gave herself to me.  She held her human form.  

The men before me had fully changed and were trying to fight my control.  They took a step closer.  When I turned my attention back at them I pushed them back.  They cowered before me.

I tired of this game.  I feed more strength into my control of the men.  More power than I had ever fed into a Therian.  I fed them my power and I commanded them all to shift.  They screamed in pain but they shifted back to their human form.  

They all lay on the ground shaking in pain.  I knelt down to the fat man.  "Do you wish to fight me more?"

From the town Thea came running at full speed.  She stopped dead in her tracks.  Her chest rose and fell from the run.  She took a deep breathe, "What is going on?"

"These men attacked me."  I stated.

The men were all cowering on the ground.  Thea looked at me.  "Why?"

"They would not take my offering of blood for the girl's theft."  I nodded to the girl in Tony's arm.

Thea knelt down to the man, "Is this true, did she offer the girls penance freely and you refused?"

He stammered.  Thea looked up at me, then at the little girl.  She smiled fondly at the girl, the little girl hid her face in Tony's shoulder.  Thea nodded, "Your own child steals from you and you hunt her down?  Then you are offered blood and you refuse, what is it with you Wolf King?"

He stood up, naked but as royal as ever.  I rolled my eyes.  "What... what... is she?"

Thea smiled, "This is Il Cane.  You have offended her."

He turned to me with fear in his eyes.  I could feel it wafting off of him.  "The Vampire Queen."

"I am no Queen"

He knelt to me and the rest of the men followed suit.  

Thea smiled, "Here my friend, you are Queen, and have been for centuries.  We should probably say god, but we believe in no god."

"They worship me?"  What an odd thought.

Thea nodded, "It is you who keep their lands safe from man from vampire.  In protecting us, you have protected them for centuries."

I nodded.  "So what should I do with this?  I will not give them this child."

The King groveled before me, "Take her, she is a gift."

"Be gone.  I tire of your games."  I walked away from them.  I really didn't want to be anywhere near where that fat man could worship me.

Tony fell in step behind me carrying the girl.  Thea caught up and smiled at me.  She whispered, "I've never seen anyone cower the Wolf King.  I felt the power you used, I was already half way here.  Everyone is here.  They are ready for the ceremony."  I nodded.
