# Unexpected Affairs

Tony sat against the way and I lay on the floor with my head in his lap.  Tony was trying to think of a way of getting out of the torture room without attracting too much attention.  I didn't care.

The door creaked open and Tristan slipped in.  He smiled and frowned all in the same instance.  "Eve's looking for her."  

Tony stood up naked, "Our clothes didn't quite make it through the process."  He grinned at Tristan as he reached down to help me stand.  "Can you stand?"

I nodded and he pulled me up to my feet.  Tristan stared I didn't know if it was surprise at seeing us standing there unashamed or if he was surprised by all the blood.  I reassured him, "It's not ours."   He looked at my face and he smiled.  

The looked around, "It is quite a mess."  He jumped back when the room caught fire.  

I grabbed my sword and my daggers and walked out the door.  "It's going to get hot."  Tristan looked at me and then back at the room and hurried out the room followed by Tony.  

Tony smiled, "Eve's going to get mad at us."  He grabbed the blanket someone offered him.  I walked past the offering.  Someone screamed and I hid the weapons in shadow and gave people the idea that they saw what they expected to see.  

Tristan blinked, "Why did she fade in and out."  

Tony laughed as the two men followed me, "She's give you want you expect to see."  He cocked his head to the side and checked out my rear, "And apparently you expect to see that."

When I turned around Tristan was red from head to toe.  I smiled sweetly and seductively at him and he got brighter red.  I turned around and went to the infirmary where Eve waited impatiently.

"Trist, it's okay, you can check her out.  She doesn't mind."  Tony tried to reassure him.

"She's your girl.  I shouldn't look at her like that."  He meant what he said.  Humans.

Tony put his arm around his friend, "I don't mind either."

They couldn't finish their conversation Eve screamed, "By the Gods."  Tony and Tristan ran into the room.  She looked at Tony and then back at me, "What the hell?"

"We got the information we needed.  And we had to put the beast back in place."  Tony stated as if it was common.

Tristan shook his head, "It's a long story"

Eve looked me over carefully, "She needs back on the IV and to sleep."

Eve wrapped me in a hospital gown and attached me to the IV drip again.  I could feel her need, her complete desire for the naked men in the room.  She helped me lay down in the bed.  I pulled her stethoscope and pulled her neck close to me, and I bit her.  Her eyes rolled back in her head and her knees got weak as her body spasmed in pleasure.  She pulled away and looked at me with a smile, "You read that?"

I nodded.  Tristan looked at her, "What just happened?"

Eve smiled, "She saw that I was a little hot and bothered by the nakedness.  She gave me what I needed to focus."

Tony smiled and whispered in my ear.  "Tristan needs a little bit too."

I looked up at him and he smiled at me.   Tony stood back up and said as he left, "I'm gonna go clean up."

Tristan started to leave but I caught his arm.  I looked at Eve and she caught my drift.  She pulled the curtains closed.

Tristan didn't try to pull away but he didn't turn around or come closer either.  I crawled out of bed and stood behind him and wrapped my arms around him.  I pressed my cheek against his back. I could feel his heart racing.  I whispered behind him.  "Turn around."

He shook his head.  I grabbed his shirt and pulled it over his head.  I ran my fingers down his sides and kissed his back.  He shivered.  I ran my tongue along his spine.  He lost a breath.  I turned him around and he didn't look me in the eyes.  He wanted this but he was ashamed of it.  I kissed his neck, and continued to seduce him until he couldn't keep his hands off me.  We kissed passionately and we fell onto the hospital bed and we had slow soft sex.  Very much the opposite of what I had just done with Tony.

When he finished he pulled himself away from me with a look of horror.  He pulled his clothes on and stalked out of the room and ran into Tony on his way out.  He glared at him, "You told her didn't you."

"I told her you needed a little bit too."

Tristan looked at him with heat, "A little bit of what?  Sex?  Sex isn't meaningless to me."

Tony shrugged, "It's not the same for her either.  But she felt your need.  How long has it been Trist?"

Tristan punched Tony in the chest, "That's not fair.  She loves you.  She can't love me, don't you get that."

"Trist, she doesn't love me either.  She trusts me.  She cares for me.  She has honor, duty and obligation to me.  She's family.  It's not love Tristan.  She doesn't know how to love."  Tony pleaded with Tristan.

"How can she not love, everyone can."  He was angry.

Tony spoke softly, "How can a girl who's lost her family to a fire, who has been raped before the age of ten, who was taught to steal thing she needed and then used for a sex toy supposed to know how to love.  She's never been loved, not when she needed it."  Tristan stared at him in horror then looked back at me with pain in his eyes.  Tony forced Tristan to look at him, "She doesn't love me.  She needs me.  I need her.   Sex is nothing more than sex with her.  What you did with her back in the place between worlds. That is trust.  She trustd you."   Tony was getting angry.  "She let you comfort her when I wasn't there.  You think that made me happy.  That I was pissed off at her and I couldn't be what she needed.  You were there Trist.  I'm not mad you did what you did, I'm mad it wasn't me.  I'm angry at myself for being an ass when she needed me.  I love her.  I love you.  Let it be enough."

Tristan stared at Tony and then back at me.  "When she slept in my arms I saw her dreams.  She dreamt of a little boy on a fountains edge.  He mouthed something I couldn't hear what it was."

I smiled and recited, "T O N Y".

Tristan looked at me as if he'd just remembered I was sitting there.  He turned back to Tony, "She dreams about you."

I grabbed Tristan's hand and made him look at me, "Only one other person can get into my dreams like that who isn't forcing their way in."

Tony touched Tristan's shoulder, "She trusts you.  She trusted you the moment you took her pain into yourself.  You had no regard for your own safety.  You didn't know what it meant.  You didn't understand the connection you made with her.  She's given you everything she can.  She'll give you everything you need."

Eve pulled the curtain away, "I know you all are having an intimate moment but she needs to sleep, so ya'll need to chill and pick this up later."

Tony looked at Eve with a smile, "If we let her sleep can we stay?"  

Eve looked at me and smiled, "Yeah if you let her sleep."

Tony closed the curtain after Eve left and lay down at my back.  I still held Tristan's hand and looked up at him.  Tony smiled at him.  "It's sleep Trist."

He looked at the two of us in bed and turned to walk away.  I pulled him back and he turned to look at me with pained eyes.  I pulled him closer and he moved slowly towards us.  I pulled him close enough to kiss his hand.  He looked at me with the look of an abused puppy.  I pulled his shirt and he moved had no choice but to come closer.  I kissed him softly on the lips and he relaxed into my arms.  We slept.   both men holding me. It started to be a very peaceful sleep.

I dreamt of the little boy on the water fountain.  The dream morphed and the boy became two boys.  I knew that wasn't my memory.  And then I saw them.  I watched as I pulled apart men and women.  I saw myself rip out the throats of a little boy.  I dropped a girl's lifeless form.  I watched I did not feel, like I always felt.  I shot awake and saw a man standing over us.  He'd done this before.  He protected his fears on to me.  His hands were above his head and one of my bloody daggers was plunging its way towards us.  I grabbed Tony's sword.  I knew it was there even if I couldn't see it.  The ring of metal was a wonderful sound and the sword move swiftly through the man's heart.  I cried out in pain and woke Tristan from his sleep.  Tony was already scrambling behind me searching for a weapon.  Christopher cried out with pain as fire engulfed him.    Out of the corner of my eye I saw a man shimmer from sight.  "Virgil"  

Tony checked the room but the man was not here, "It was a dream?"

I nodded but I didn't have time to say anything as the smell of burning flesh became too much.  I quickly turned and wretched on the floor.  Eve came running into the room "What is that awful smell?"

In between heaves I got out, "Burning spy."

Eve looked at Tony, "Is she always that sensitive to smells?"

Tony shook his head, "No, just that one.  When she was human she was a vegetarian.  Ironic huh?"

Eve looked confused, Tristan answered to my surprise, "Her family burnt to death in a fire."  He looked up at Tony, "The smell of burning flesh was burned into her mind."  Tony nodded.  

"She never stays to watch a body burn, she knows it'll burn and not get anything else unless she loses control of the fire."

Eve smiled and patted my head, "At least she hasn't eaten much to empty out."
