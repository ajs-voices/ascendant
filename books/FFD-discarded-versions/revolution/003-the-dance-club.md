# The Dance Club

It took us 20 hours to get to Dangdburgh, and I had worried the whole way there.  The weather was a drastic difference.  New York was humid, but getting out of the air conditioned RV was like hitting an invisible wall.  I hated the South in the late summer.  We got out into a large parking lot outside of what looked like a large warehouse, but with a large neon sign blinking "Frozen" in ice blue lettering.  From the line wrapping around the corner it looked like a very popular dance club.

I could feel that those standing in line were both human and vampire.  The Council was inside and my only childe vampire was inside as well.  It had been many years since I'd spoken to Alistair.  But it hadn't been long enough for me to fume over the last conversation we had before he left.  I still hadn't forgiven him for his words.  I didn't care that he left; he called me a monster, and less than a vampire.  I saved his life, not once, but twice and that was what he thought of me.  I hated him for it.

Ryan tapped me on the shoulder.  "Coming?"

I sighed and spoke softly, "Alistair is in there."  

He nodded, "He owns the joint."

Great! Just what I needed, but I started walking again.  By the time I reached the velvet ropes barring our passage the others had already gone in.  The man, no the vampire bouncer, held out his arm in front of me.  "No weapons allowed."

I did a double take.  I really wasn't in the mood and my voice showed it, "What?"

"Owner wrote here, No weapons allowed next to your name.  You are Cari, correct?"  I nodded.  "You can hand them over to me and I'll make sure they get back to you."

"I don't have any on me."

He laughed.  "Johnny said you'd say that.  Please just take them off."

I was getting angrier and my pulse was racing.  My voice was gravelly and quiet.  "I will not!  Unless you intend to explain yourself to The Council, then let me in."

He backed up, "I'm sorry I can't."

Ryan put his hand on my arm.  "Come on Cari just give up the weapons."

I pushed Ryan, probably harder than I had meant, "I will not!"

Ryan saw the fury in my eyes, and heard the cold in my voice.  He pushed me back hard enough to move me away from the crowd.  He continued to push until we were in the middle of the parking lot before he tried to talk to me again.  But I had nothing left in me for words.  I drew my sword and I attacked Ryan.  He had no choice but to defend himself.  I don't think I would have killed him, but I know he would have killed me if he had to.  I don't know how long we fought; the clang of the swords was the only thing that mattered.  It was no longer about the argument at hand; it was about the fight - the life and death of the sword.  

Things happened quickly.  I don't know what happened first.  I don't know if Alistair had stepped in the middle of the fight, or if I was being held by my arms tighter than anything I could imagine first.  A familiar presence was behind me but I didn't fully understand in the heat of the fight.  I fought against the arms that held me.  

"Calm down."  And with the words calmness washed over me.  Just from those words I knew exactly who was holding me and I tried not to melt, the anger helped in that way, I did all I could to calm the anger but Alistair just enraged me further.

I didn't hear most of what Alistair yelled at me, "For the love of all things, what the hell is this about?"

I glared back at him and my anger started to rise again.  I started struggling against the man's arms again.  "Back off Johnny.  She has to calm down.  Unless you want to die that is."  My body would have melted into the body that held me, but my fury was too powerful.  All I wanted to do was kill Alistair right now.

Johnny and Alistair were one and the same but I had forgotten that Alistair went by Johnny now.  It was always hard to remember.  The mere thought of his name made the anger stir inside me.  

Johnny directed his attention to the man holding me, "Tony, you back off.  This is my place.  She will not bring weapons into my home."

Tony put his face next to my ear, it couldn't be comfortable, but he whispered, "Calm down.  It's okay.  Deep breath."  

If it had been anyone else it would have been patronizing, but Tony had always had that effect on me, I could feel the anger leaving.  Tony looked up to Johnny.  "She won't.  I promise, but ... Back. Off."  The threat in Tony's voice made my hackles rise but Tony rubbed my arms while still holding tightly on to me.

Johnny left in a flurry and Tony let me go.  I was about to yell at him about the weapons, but he held up my sword belt with sword in his right hand and the daggers in his left.  He smiled at me.  I was angry again.  I threw a punch but Ryan caught my hand before landing.  He laughed, "She's been cooped up too long." 

I turned to glare at Ryan, but the anger was gone.  It wasn't worth it.  I sighed and started for the velvet ropes.  The men exchanged looks.  I ignored them as I walked past the rope and bouncer who was holding the rope as far from me as he could.  He wanted no part of me.  I didn't blame him.

I walked into the darkness of the club and almost all eyes turned to look at me.  Shit!  I grabbed at my metaphysical shields and clapped them shut.  My anger had opened a gaping hole and now all the vampires in the club stared at me.  Tony put his arm around my shoulder and with his help the overwhelming power was contained and the crowd went back to their own business - all except for those in front of us.  They seemed to part like Moses parting the Red Sea.  They didn't even know they were doing it.  I looked up at Tony and he was smiling.  He was enjoying using his power to impress me.

We reached the stairs and another thought hit me and I threw Tony's arm from shoulders.  He looked at me confused.  I glared at him and then climbed the stairs two at a time.  I heard Ryan behind me tell Tony, "She's afraid the Council will kill the both of you for seeing each other."  I didn't hear Tony's reply, but it didn't matter, I was staring at the door the council was behind.  The whole council was on this side of the ocean and in one room.  It had not happened since I had been created!
