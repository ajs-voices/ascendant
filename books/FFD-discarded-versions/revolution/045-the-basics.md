# The Basics

The children followed me into the darkness.  I felt their eagerness through their mental connection.  I was glad to be included, but I was grateful it wasn't all the time.  That many children running around in my mind would probably drive me crazy.  

We went out to the beach the sand would provide good resistance to their movements and help with their balance.  Balance and strength were key in using a weapon, even if it was a gun.  Though I'd never done much with a gun I knew I could fire one in a pinch, I don't think I could hit the target without much luck, but I could do it and at least startle the opponent.  The children would not be using guns, for now they'd be using sticks.

I stopped and turned to the four children and smiled, their first instruction.  "Find a straight stick about the length of your arm about as thick as your thumb."  They ran off into the direction of the forest.

I turned back to the ocean and sat on the damp sand.  I stared out over the waves and listened to the waves softly crash on the sand.  The stars were out in plenty and they looked like diamonds in the heavens.  Mia would have liked it here.  I laid back on the sand and thought of my friend.  Thought of the day we'd met, of the scared little girl we'd found tied to a stake left for the wolves or worst to devour.  We had all grown since those days.  I was going to miss Mia.  

I don't know how long I laid on the sand staring at the sky, but the children returned with their sticks.  They stood above me in a circle, ready to begin.  I sat up and when I turned around I saw that four had turned into about ten children all wielding sticks.

I smiled.  I pulled a sword from my sheath and showed the children how to hold their sticks.   "Hold your sticks like this.  About two finger widths from the bottom."  I helped a few of the younger children get it right.  

"Space out."  I instructed, "Hold your arms out like this."  I held my arms straight out from my sides, my sword extended to the right.  "Your fingers should touch the stick tip of the one next to you."  They scooted and stood as instructed.  I dropped my arms and they followed suit.  

I turned my back to them and I showed them where their stick would rest on their hip.  I assumed they followed me.  I unsheathed my sword and held my sword in a guard stance, ready for everything but relaxed.  I made a few basic moves, concentrating mostly on foot work.  I repeated several times, "Continue while I watch."

I turned around and saw the children following my motions.  Some were falling over their own feet, others were hitting their neighbors, but what I noticed most of all that we were gathering an audience of adults.  Some of the seasoned military men were watching, the women were frowning at the children playing at being swordsmen.  I saw Ryan and Ant stepping between the children helping the ones having the most trouble.  I smiled at them when the saw me watching.  Their smiles were wide. They enjoyed teaching, particularly children.

I stepped aside and Ant stepped in front of the children.  In a loud clear voice he gave them more instructions.  I showed them what he meant with my own sword.  He smiled at me.  He shouted out the names of movements and forms and I performed them.  The children followed me.  It was a good team effort.  Ant was good with the children.

Ryan was helping the children.  They really did make a great team.  When the movements were starting to repeat I turned to watch.  The crowd had grown even more. 

We taught well into the night.  The sky was starting to lighten and we wrapped things up.  The children clung to their sticks like they were real weapons.  I wished I could give them real swords, but the time and effort to do so was not there.  

Riley, Michael, and Scott walked with us back to the house.  Riley stopped in front of the door barring our way, He cleared his throat, "I'm sorry.  I see the merit of your teachings.  But I don't see how a stick will help."

I laughed, "A stick can be a good weapon as a sword if you know how to use it.  Now if you don't mind I'd like to get inside before we start igniting."

Riley frowned at me but he didn't move.  Ryan picked up the military man with ease and moved him out of the way, "Sorry dude, but my family is about to be crispy, get out of the way."

I smiled and walked into the house and away from any windows, Ant followed, the girls and Lee and Leyla where already curled up in blankets.  Carissa and Morgan were covering their entire bodies while the two Therian children were barely covered.  I turned to the front door.  "Riley it is right?  You may not understand or believe, but long before there were guns.  Sticks and swords were the way of men in battle.  You fight people who are using your technology, but your technology is limited now in this world.  Ammo is limited.  Metal is limited.  Rocks and Sticks are plenty."  I sat down on the overly enveloping sofa behind me, "And I'm not teaching them to fight our war.  I'm teaching them how to defend themselves if necessary."

He still looked disgusted at me.  Tony stepped in between us, "You will never agree, just drop it."  Riley rolled his eyes at me.  

Tony put his arm around me and led me away to a dark room.  He opened the door and two figured quickly hid in the blankets.  I laughed.  "I saw you two.  I'd never have thought it, but good for you."  

Alec chuckled beneath the blankets and Valentine shushed him.  It made me smile.  Tony shut the door and whispered, "I hope I didn't ruin their mood."  He grinned at me.

He put his arm around me and pulled me in close to him.  "We could be.."  I felt what he'd meant; I smiled at him and let him lead me to another empty room.  It was good to wind down in Tony's arms.  It was good to be with him without interruption.  We made love and then we slept until the next evening.  

We played the same game for several days.  Rumors of the training must have been moving from conclave to conclave.  More people began to show up to learn from Il Cane.  But with positive rumors there would always be negative ones.  

Ryan and Ant were teaching the students and I watched.  Tony and Francesco came to sit with me as I watched.   We sat in silence and watched.

Francesco leaned forward and turned to us so only we could hear.  "I think it's time we left."

I nodded, "Well past time."

Tony frowned, "What will we do?"

I smiled, "We'll go to the next conclave, until it becomes too dangerous.  We work our way to Valence, but we train those along the way, we befriend all we can.  We will need all the friends we can get in the end."

Francesco nodded, "See your girl has a military mind even if she is not a leader."

Tony hugged me and Francesco looked away.  I laughed, "He's still squeamish with me."  

I stood up and kissed Francesco on the cheek, "No need to look away, no one judges you."

I could feel his eyes on me as I walked to Ant and Ryan.  They halted their lessons for me to speak.  "Today is our last lesson here.  We must move for the safety of your homes and persons."  There were no questions or stunned looks; they knew the day had been coming.  I smiled at them, "It has been a pleasure being with you here.  May our paths cross again."
