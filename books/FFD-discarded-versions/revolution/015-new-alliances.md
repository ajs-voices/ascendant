# New Alliances

Everyone was excited about their new discovery. Tony and Tristan were already plotting and planning with Henry hovering close. The former council members were in deep conversation with Francesco and Marie. Thea was in council with David West and the three other men I did not know. It was about time I introduced myself.

Nicola had clung to my hand since she'd gotten there.  She looked up at me in a very adult way, "Tony and Tristan call them your furry friends."  

I sighed. The nick name was disrespectful, were we his undead friends? One of the men saw me coming and smiled. I could feel the power of their disease radiating from the lot of them. Therians were just as powerful as a vampire, but their power  was a disease that many believe could be cured. Doc was one of the few doctors who was willing to try. The thought of my Lessers made me sink to my knees. Their torture was still going on. I lay in a ball on the floor with their nightmares becoming my reality again. The next thing I remember was a mass of bodies around me.  Thea was at my head, comforting me in a way that a mother comforts a child.  She spoke softly to me, "You need to feed more."  A pair of arms scooped me up.  I was too tired to protect.  The moment I was in his arms, I knew it was Tony.  He held me close to his body and took me to another cabin in the woods.  The windows were all covered in thick material, no light could enter.  He set me down on the bed.  "You need to feed."  He held his wrist to me and I looked up at him with concern.  He rarely offered to feed me when there were humans around.  

"Your father and mother would be appalled if I did."  I turned away from him.  I stared at the wall.

"They already know.  They don't understand why I would, or why you would, but they know."   I didn't roll over, I don't know why it wasn't comforting to have me close, but I wanted him to go away.  He felt my mood, he always did, but he stayed, he lay down beside me and wrapped his arms around me and pulled me close to him.  My body reacted to him like no other.  Every muscle in my body relaxed, my mind soothed.  The beast and the nightmares went still and I basked in the quietness.  He put his wrist next to my mouth, and without thinking I bit.  I drank until I was full.  And when I was done Tony held me, he didn't let me go until the following evening.

When I woke still in Tony's arms I thought something was wrong, did I take too much?  When I sat up and looked at Tony he was awake and watching me.  He smiled, "I'm fine."  

"There is a line outside.  You need to feed.  They are all willing to feed you.  Eat Cari, until you are full, until you can drink no more."  Tony sat up and kissed me on the forehead.  "They are offering themselves to you.  Do not harm them."

Tony got up and opened the door.  The first in line was a man I did not know.  He was at the meeting, but I didn't know his name.  He walked past Tony with a smile.  He held out his arm and sat down on the edge of the bed.

I started at his face.  I felt his power; I was drawn to his power.  "What are you?"

He looked down at me in confusion, "A Therian."  My expression spoke a thousand words, "Oh, you mean what type?"  He smiled.  "I'm a blank panther; to be specific I'm a jaguar."

I nodded, "Feline.  I've never met one before.  I've only ever met one of you, he was a wolf."  I touched his arm and it felt like little electrical sparks jumping between the two of us.  "You've been feeding me the most haven't you?"

He smiled, "How did you know?"

I ran my hand down his arm;   I edged closer and touched his chest.  I looked up and saw Tony watching me.  "Go get Dimitri."  Tony didn't hesitate.

The man looked at me with concern, "Why's he getting The Beast King?"

I turned to look at him instead of through him.  "Your power calls to me.  It hurts to touch you, but I can't help myself.  Dimitri will understand."

"Dimitri will just say I'm your beast's flavor."  He smiled, "You explained it like ice cream when I told him I was drawn to you.  Why I felt the need to feed you, to give you my power."  

I touched his chest again.  It wasn't what I wanted.  I moved closer, I lifted his shirt and my hand touched his bare chest.  His eyes closed.  I smiled.  "You feel it now."  He tried to speak but he couldn't he nodded instead.  He took off his shirt and pushed me to the bed.  He kissed me deeply.  It hurt.  The touching hurt, not the kiss itself.  His power called to mine.  It felt like electrical shocks jumping between our bodies.  He pulled back with a yelp.

I looked up at him, "I don't think that's a good idea, if you don't like pain."

When he sat back up I wrapped my arms around his neck, he sat up but he untangled my arms from his neck.  "I can't."  

I quickly grabbed his arm and pulled it to my mouth.  I bit softly into his wrist.  I was surprised there were no physical sparks showing.  I feed on his power.  I feed on his life blood.  I drank just short of too long, even for one of his kind.  But I felt better.  I felt glorious.

When I looked up Dimitri was standing there, but his eyes were on my Therian friend.  "Alex, you okay?"   When he nodded Dimitri turned to me with anger in his eyes.  "You have no idea what you did to him."

"I didn't do anything Dimitri.  I fed on him, that's it."

Dimitri helped Alex up and then he threw me against the wall.  "Not now, before!"

"I've never met him before now."

Dimitri looked confused, he looked over at Alex and when Alex nodded his confirmation he turned back to me.  "You've taken an animal to call Cari, without his consent, without his knowing."

"How could I do that if I never met him?"

Thea walked into the room, "That's probably my fault.  Alex gave her his blood straight from his body, as soon as I found out he stopped, but that must have done something."

Dimitri looked at Alex.  Alex looked down.  "You did this.  Then you will finish it, or you'll both pay.  It's really no wonder why she's in as much pain as she is, a raw unfinished connection draining her powers."  Dimitri snatched my arm and held it to the man in front of me.  "Take part of the woman you nearly killed."

Alex looked up in confusion.  Tony pushed him gently to me.  "He means drink her blood, finish the tie.  You'll both feel better, trust me."

I tried to pull my hand from Dimitri but he held strong.  Alex looked at Dimitri with fear.  Dimitri was going to confront him.  "Finish it"

"Your power is intoxicating to her.  She'll never be whole without this.  We need her whole."  Dimitri's voice was humming in a quiet white rage.  His anger made mine boil.

I growled, "Just do it so I can go."  The beast inside me was rising.  

Dimitri looked at Alex in panic; I could see the fear in their eyes.  I felt their fear.  Dimitri pulled Alex closer, "Do it now, or we'll never calm her down."

Alex bit into my wrist and the pain shot through me like a silver bullet.  He sucked softly and drank freely for a second then pulled away wiping his mouth and running out of the room.

Dimitri looked at Tony.  Tony only nodded and Dimitri dropped my arm and closed the door behind him.  I could hear bolts being drawn.  Tony looked at me and I stared back at him through the blood haze.  

"Calm."

"I don't want to be calm."  

Tony smiled, "You want to fight?"

I looked through him at the door behind him and then back at him.  "No."

"What do you want?"  He asked, as if he'd have the answer.  "You want the cat back?"

I snarled.  He laughed, "You want to hurt the cat."

I took a step closer to him.  He smiled.  "You can hurt me, or try to."  I looked at the door behind him.  "You aren't getting out of here without going through me."  I turned my attention to him again.  "It may have been a long time ago, but I can handle you."

Tony used his powers, he radiated peace and calm throughout the room.  I couldn't step in any direction without it bathing me in its pink light.  Tony smiled, "You want to be enraged.  You don't want to be at peace."  He was concerned.  A light went off in his eyes.  He stepped slowly towards me and I backed away.  There was only so far I could go before I ran into the wall.  Tony still stepped to me.  "Calm Cari."   He reached his hand out to me and I swatted it away.  He reached again after another step; I continued to bat at his hand.  He stepped and reached until he could touch me, until he had me pinned against the wall.  "I won't let you die."

I looked up at him, "Why not?  You hate me."  I tried to push and squirm out of his grasp.  But he held me tight against the wall.  I growled at him.

He leaned in to me, pain in his eyes.  "I don't hate you.  I hate what happened.  But I don't hate you."  He leaned in closer; I could feel his breathe on my skin.  "Don't make me do it Cari."

I looked up at him.  His face was so close, I could kiss him.  "Do what?"  It was a taunt.  

Tony pulled me and then slammed me into the wall. "You want me to hurt you?"

My eyes rolled in the back of my head.  Tony let go of me, still as close as he had been.  "I won't hurt you again."

I growled and punched him in the stomach and kneed him in the chin as he doubled over.  I ran for the door.  But Tony was faster.  "No I don't think so."  He grabbed my shoulders and slammed me into the wall.  

The room was too small, the walls were too thin.  We pushed back and forth until the think plaster gave way.  The longer we went on the less cautious we were, the more it came to be about survival.  We fought inside the tiny room, the ceiling shaking, the light fixtures rattled above us.  Plaster fell from the ceiling.  

I used all my strength and threw Tony, he crashed through the wall, the way was finally clear.  Tony lay stunned in the other room, but Ryan stood in the path.  I saw Tony stand up behind him.  I only had eyes for him.  I looked through Ryan.  Tony moved the human from his path with gentle guidance.  Neither of them was going to let me out of that room.  I growled in frustration.

I heard talking in the other room.  "Why are we letting them kill each other?" It was the voice of a boy with concerns over his father.  I looked up at Tony and the rage faded, I let the pink calming light in.  I gave up.  I dropped to my knees and I cried.

Tony towered above me.  Ryan stared in stunned silence.

Aurora pushed past the men.  "She heard Henry.  She didn't want to take his last parent from him.  She didn't want to kill you Tony.  She loves you, don't you get that by now."  She was angry at them.

"I know she loves me, why do think I'm here.  To get laid?"  Tony was angry.

Tristan walked in to the room, "You two fighting is making her want to fight again.  She's keen to anger, you two should know that."

Aurora looked abashed.  She looked at me and patted my shoulder and then left the room.   Everyone else left but Tony.   He knelt down beside my head and laid a gentle hand on my back.  "Maybe Henry is the key."  He sat above me in silence.  

"Family is the key."  It was like thunder booming in the room.  He lifted me by the shoulders so he could look me in the eyes.  He smiled, "Family is why you are going crazy.  I knew they were your friends, but they are the key.  We, your family, is why you fight the way you do."  He pulled me close and held me tight.  He picked me up to look me in the eyes, "We'll save them.  I promise, we'll fix this."  He dropped me abruptly and ran out of the room.

Alarms went off, everyone scrambled.  I heard the familiar chant of the birds.   Someone was using the place between worlds.  I could smell the familiar scent of burning flesh.  I crawled to the door and watched from the doorway as the lone figure burned in the darkness.  They knew we were here.  I stood up.  I took a step, and then another, and another until I was walking toward Thea.  "We must go."  She turned to me with fear.  She knew I was right, but she was afraid of the situation.  

I took Thea by the shoulders and spoke softly to her, "We will leave.  Seal the shadows we used to get here."

Thea smiled at me with relief, "We can't fight this fight, but we can heal, we can mend the wounded.  The long house is safe; we can make shadows to use."

"But then they can come in too."  Thea smiled at me.

"Not if it's only one person.  One person must be present or the traps will arm immediately.  You've taught us many things since we've been watching over you.  You may not have known it, but you are a great teacher even in your slumber."

Tony put his arm around me, "I know who would be good.  I don't want him fighting, but he's old enough, he's capable and he's strong enough to take more than a few people."

I nodded, "Henry would be good, and he'd be out of the way then."

Tony nodded, "My point exactly, responsibility with less danger."

I didn't agree there.  Thea helped me to the long house and I laid the initial ward for her to work off of. Tony fetched Henry.  When then men arrived Thea smiled at Henry.  

I spoke to the lad.  He had grown much since the last time I'd remember seeing him.  "I have a job for you.  It's a huge responsibility."  Henry's chest inflated, he was proud of himself.    "Thea has offered her clan's healing ability to our cause.  But they need the land here to heal well.  We need someone to bring people back and forth; it can only be one person.  Not me, Not Tony, Only you can do this."  He stepped forward proudly, but I stopped his progress, "Wait, I'm not finished.  I am trusting you to keep them safe.  If you get caught, you can't take the enemies here."  He started to protest, "I know you won't do it on purpose.  But if I can't save you to keep my people safe, I will kill you."  His eyes darkened and his smile faded.

Thea looked at me with anger.  "You are scaring the boy."

Tony smiled, "She's doing it on purpose."  Tony turned to his son, "Cari will kill you if you let her down.  But more importantly, she trusts you with her family.  She trusts no one with her family's safety, not even me.  It's yours if you want it."

Henry smiled, his pride returning, "Where do I sign?"

I said and pointed to the new area.  "Spit."

He looked at me.  Thea laughed.  "I need your DNA, spitting works well.  Spit over there."  She pointed where I had.

Henry did and there was a silent thunder boom.  Thea looked at me.  "We will make it shadows at any time of the day.  Give us a week before you use it before dark."  I nodded.

A crowd of men and women filed into the long building, Alex was at their lead.  He stopped well short of me.  He was afraid of me.  I looked at them in askance.

Alex started to speak but stumbled.  He cleared his throat that sounded nearly like a roar.  A woman in the back giggled but was quickly quieted.  He tried again, "If we join you, will you take care of us too."

Tony stepped forward, "Of course."  

But Alex glared at him, "We won't join just for you, we'll follow if she," he pointed at me, "promises to protect us too."

Tony spoke again, "You mean like family?"

David stepped forward, "Yeah, we've been feeding her religiously for twelve years."

I took a step towards the crowd of Therians.  I touched David's arm and held out my hand to Alex.  

Tony whispered to Thea, "What's she doing?"  

Thea whispered back, "Bonding with the animals." I could hear the smile in her voice, "She offering them comfort like you would do for a beloved pet."  She stammered, "Not that they are pets, it's just the gesture."

Alex looked at me.  I wiggled my fingers and he took my hand.  Every other Therian in the room touched the one in front of them and to their side, a network of comfort.  David looked up to Tony, "We are in."
