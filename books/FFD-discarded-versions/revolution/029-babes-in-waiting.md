# Babes In Waiting

I woke to bright lights and loud beeping noises.  I blinked the haze away, but found it difficult to do anything but breathe. I tried to sit up, I heard a female voice call out, "She's awake."

Eve shined a bright light in my eyes and helped me to sit up.  "You scared us."  She turned to her nurse, "Get Tristan and Tony."  

A hand grabbed mine and squeezed, I turned to look and found Aurora's smiling face beaming back at us, "We are glad to have you back.  We have much to discuss dear one, very much."

I felt uncomfortable and I tried to straighten my gown and found something highly unexpected.  "What the hell?"

Aurora laughed, "Like you don't know how that happens."

"We would never have let you go if we'd known you were with child."  

I shook my head, "How long has it been?"

Tony walked in with a bright smile and Tristan was close on his heals.  "Nearly nine months."

I looked down and my huge belly.  Tristan smiled and kissed me on my forehead, "Care to know what you are having?"

I blinked, Tony laughed, "She can't believe we knocked her up on the first night."

"We?" I asked surprised.

Eve took my hand, "You are having twins.  And we tested early and it seems one for each father.  You my girl are very fertile for an undead vampire."

I lay back in shock.  "What happened?"

Aurora sat forward, "Well, you and the boys here had sex."  I glared at her and she smiled, "Not that, then what?"

"You were shot in the head with a silver bullet."  Eve explained, "Your body couldn't maintain the pregnancy AND heal you at the same time.  So your instincts were to shut down and heal and grow and feed off of your Chevalier, and the blood we infused into you.  But because the babes are living these, four have been eating us out of house and home without a second look back."  

I nodded, "And the General?"

Eve smiled and let Tony answer.  "You killed him.  The refinery was freed.  Your impromptu invasion gained us a few powerful allies and we saved many more human.  The vampires are all in a special prison so they won't cause us anymore harm." 

Tristan added, "You are wanted for the death of the General.  I hear it's a great mansion in the promised land and a high place among the powerful."

I looked at them.  "He's dead then, and I'm wanted for his assassination."  I smiled.  "And all I'm worth is choice house."

Tony laughed, "And a place of high esteem among the New Order.  We have quite figured out what that means."

I looked to Tristan he was nearly hopping on the bed, I looked up at Tony, "New parent."  I smiled at Tristan, "Well tell me."

He looked like he'd been given a big prize, "Girls."

I nodded.  I looked to Eve, "And?"

She patted my hand, "They are both healthy. They hold hands."

"Do we know anything else?" I asked cautiously I didn't want to hurt Tristan's feelings.  Even shook her head, "We don't know.  They'll be here soon.  Or I don't think you would have woken up.  We were worried about labor."

"So I'm here till they are?"  

Tristan nodded and Tony laughed, "Stuck in bed girl friend."

Aurora smiled, "But we can all talk about our plans."

I looked at Aurora with curiosity; Francesco stepped in from behind my men.  "An army of Chevalier, Vampires and Therians."

I blinked at Francesco, "I can't take that many on."  

He smiled, "Anyone who can sustain one will take one.  And if they can do more, we'll do more."

"That's a bit dangerous."  I said, it was way too dangerous.

"It is.  But it's no more dangerous than sending in unprepared humans to their slaughter; this will give everyone we send a fighting chance."

I shrugged, I wasn't a statistician.  I didn't know the theory of war; I only knew how to kill.

"I told you she wouldn't care."  Tony quipped at his father.  He turned to me, "But you need to teach us to work like a team.   I watch Ryan and Ant and I see perfection.  We need that for everyone we send in.  They work their butts off trying to teach it, but we need you."

"What am I teaching?  I can't teach anything about working with firearms."  

Tony smiled, "We've a black smith, forging an arsenal of silver plated weapons."

I blinked in surprise and then cried out in pain.

Eve hurried to me and checked my most private parts.  "They are coming.  Everyone out but family."  No one left.  Eve sighed, "Stupid request wasn't it."  She focused on me and said push.  "I did as ordered."  

And in minutes later the girls were gracing the world with their presence.  They were held by one of their fathers while Eve finished with me.  They cried heartily.  I couldn't think, "They're cold."

Tristan looked at me, "How do you know? All I feel is fear."

I held out my arms for the girl in Tristan's arms, "She's cold.  I held her to my chest and covered her with the blanket over me and her crying stopped.  The other one stopped crying too.

Tony looked at the other baby and back at the one in his arms.  "This one is not giving me any vibes."

Eve took the babe from Tony and handed her to me.  "I think they'll do better together."  The newest babe snuggled against her sister.  They held hands.  "See."  Eve looked at me, "If ya'll name then now can I take them and run some test.  I promise I won't hurt them.  I feel Cari's questions they are strong she won't be able to focus on what ya'll need to do."

I looked at Tony and Tristan.  Tristan smiled, "We have names picked out if you like them."

I waited for them to tell me.  They were enjoying making me wait.  Tristan spoke first.  "Morgan."  He touched the one he had held first.  Tony nodded, "And Carissa."

I blinked at him.  "You didn't think I'd remember?"

I shook my head, he smiled, "No one calls you that, it's a pretty name."

Tristan touched the other little girl.  I looked up at Eve, "Morgan and Carissa.  Can you remember which is which?."

She laughed and wrote on a piece of paper and slipped it on the bracelet I had failed to notice, "Morgan Marshall-Giovanni."

I looked up at them with a peaked interest.  Tristan laughed, "I didn't know the two of you had shared a last name with not even being married."

Tony said, "The irony of it."

Eve placed the second paper in the bracelet of the second little one; I read the paper "Carissa Marshall-Giovanni".

I picked up Carissa first and Morgan started to cry.  Eve took one her and handed her to the nurse behind her.  I handed her Morgan and looked up at Eve, "She's cold."

"You really feel what she feels?"  

"I can't explain it."  

Ant chose that time to come see his sisters.  He kissed their foreheads, "She's the same way with me.  It's a mother thing."

Tony shook his head, "No it's a Cari thing. Sierra never could read the kids.  She hated that I knew what they wanted more than she did.  But I can't read those two."
