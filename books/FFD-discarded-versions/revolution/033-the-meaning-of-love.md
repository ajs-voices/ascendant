# The Meaning Of Love

More than two dozen men and women walked in with a mortal soul and walked out an immortal army.  Human,  vampire and therian alike, were now what The CHSB rested their faith on.  They rested their faith on me training them to be a team, I don't think I can do it, but Tristan and Tony say I can, I'll believe them until I fail.

We all had a lot of things to do before tomorrow.  The evening dawned the first day of their real training.  Tristan and Tony were off trying to find willing food for me.  Neither wanted to leave me but I could handle myself with two little ones, I wasn't incapable of being a parent.

Eve walked me to the room we'd live in.  "It used to be a room for four or five women, but they said they'd give you all the bigger space and moved into Tony's old room.  And one had Alec and Valentine take down their handy work and moved in to your closet."  She smiled, "It really was a closet."  I nodded.

"They've set everything up, you shouldn't need me.  Unless you want me to stay?"  Eve asked.

I shook my head, "I'm fine really.  You want to do this now?"

She did a double take, "Oh, you mean?  Now?"

"Why not it won't take long and we are here now."  

She shrugged, "Sure.  And I'd do this for free as long as you let me do my own research."  I nodded, she smiled, she offered me her wrist and I cut a fine line in mine.  She looked at me and nodded, "Oh.." A deep breath, "kay".  She drank.  I said a few words then drank myself.  I felt Eve floating in the back of my mind.  She smiled at me, "Wow, okay.  That was easy."

I smiled.  "Thank you.  You can go back and do what you do when you don't have a patient."

She laughed and closed the door behind me.  The girls were silently sleeping in their sling.  I pulled Carissa from her pouch and laid her in the crib.  We had two, but there was no need yet, I laid Morgan beside her.  They instant reached for each other's hands.  I smiled and covered the sleeping girls, then sat down in the chair next to their bed.  It was comfortable and I drifted to sleep.

Dreams were always fitful since seeing Virgil appear when I had killed Christopher.  We needed to take him out.  We needed to take all the other side council members.  He might as well be first.

I heard the door start to open and I drew a dagger before realizing it was Tony.  "Everything okay?"  

Tony nodded, "You didn't release Tristan did you?"

"Why?"  I asked.

"Feedback, he doesn't sense it, but I do."  Tony sounded concerned.

"I am blocking his connection to me."   

Tony nodded. "Why didn't you release him?  I'm not mad, but he needs to know."

I nodded.  "Selfish action I guess."  

Tony laughed, "You selfish?  That I find hard to believe."

I looked up at Tony, "He loves you.  I mean really loves you.  I didn't want to let go of that."

He blinked at me with surprise and came over to me.  He wrapped his arms around me with tears in his eyes.  "You really are growing into a real person."

I smacked his hand.  He smiled and whispered in my ear, "He loves you too.  I love you."  He kissed my cheek, "And I know you love me, and you'll love Tristan the same."

I nodded, and turned to look at Tony over my shoulder, "I do love you.  I love the girls, and Ant.  I love Ryan and Mia, and I love Tristan."  Tony smiled at me proud of the announcement.  "He taught me what it was to love someone else.  I've always felt these things, but now I see someone else loving another.  I really feel it.  I couldn't let it go.  I need it as a reminder that I love my family."

Tony was crying. He held me tight.  It wasn't a sob, just happy tears.  Tristan opened the door to find us in the loving embrace, he felt jealous.  I smiled at him and held out my hand to him.  He took it and sat on my lap.  The rocking chair shifted forward with a jerk and Tony smacked his chin on my head.   Tony kissed the top of my head.  I smiled at Tristan, "I love you."

He stared at me with disbelief.  He looked up at Tony.  I could feel Tony nodding his head.  Tristan leaned in and kissed me.  "What brought that on?"

I looked down.  "I didn't let you go, I was being selfish."  I removed the block and I saw his eyes widen.

"Why?"  He was near anger, but he waited to yell at me until I explained.

I gave him the same explanation I gave Tony and Tristan kissed me with more passion that he had before.  I blocked the link again.  

Tristan looked down at me, "Why'd you do that?"

I smiled, "You and Tony need to learn to read each other without me in the way.  When you master that, we can add me into the mix.  I don't play well ask Ryan."

Tony laughed, "He's mentioned that before, actually so has Ant.  They don't like working with you in a team effort."

Tony added, "And why they are usually against you."  I nodded.

"They usually have separate jobs that don't rely on me playing nice."  

I unwound from the men in my life and sat down on the edge of the bed and flopped backwards staring at the ceiling.  I asked to no one in particular, "How did this happen?"

Tony asked, "What happen?"

"The girls."

Tristan chimed in with the physics of the birds and the bees.   

I sat up and glared at him, "I know how that part happened."  I turned to Tony, "Why now?  What did we do?"

Tristan snapped in "This wasn't an accident it was a miracle."

I reached out my hand for him but he refused to take it.  He glared at me.

"It's neither, it's magic, Tristan.  I can't have children, I'm dead."

He stepped back stunned.  Tony stepped between us, "It was probably you fulfilling, " Tony stepped to the side and indicated Tristan, "his desire."

I nodded and looked at Tristan with care, I didn't want to offend him, "You wanted a family?"

"Of course I did, I do."  Tristan was still angry.

"Were you thinking about a family when we all had sex?"  I asked curiously.

Tristan shrugged, "I don't know that was more than nine months ago."

I sighed, "Tristan, I don't want to do this again."  I pointed at the girls.  "I don't want to wind up accidentally pregnant because you want a large family."  Before he could protest, "I do not mind a large family and I will give you want you need eventually, but not right now, if we have sex again will I get pregnant?"

He started to say something but stopped, "I guess I hadn't thought about it like that."

Tony pulled us all together, and he held us both, "You are still understanding our world.  We give you leeway, but you have to trust us."  Tristan nodded and Tony turned to me, "And you need to be less heartless."

I pulled away from Tony and glared at him, then walked out of the door.  I heard Tony sigh, "I shouldn't have said that."  But whatever he said after I didn't hear I was too far out of ear shot.
