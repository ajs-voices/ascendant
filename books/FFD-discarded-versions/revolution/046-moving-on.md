# Moving On

Once the lesson was over for the night, we all went to gather what few things we possessed.  Long since the day where we had actual things to pack.  We lived on the charity of others now.  It was that way for most people these days it seemed.   It was nice to have friends.  

While I helped the children gather their homemade dolls and wooden sticks, Alec and Valentine came to me with sad smiles.

Alec cleared his throat.  I stopped and turned to him.  He actually wanted my attention.   "Can we talk a moment?"  

I nodded, "Yeah, sure."

Valentine smiled, "We have something to ask you?"

"The answer is yes."  I already knew what they wanted to ask, I expected some of them to want to stay.  Going to war was tiring and they'd been doing it for about 18 years now.

Valentine, "See you have a bit of Auspex."

I shook my head, "No, I expected some of us to want to stay here."

Alec sighed with relief.  "I was afraid you might be speaking of something else.  Or not let us stay at all."

"Why wouldn't I let you stay?"  I smiled, "I'm not your boss.  If anything you shouldn't be asking me."

Alec nodded, "Yeah, but things have changed.  People answer to Il Cane now.  We come when you call."

Valentine included, "And we do so because we when it's needed.  We are yours, we will come if you call, but we'd like to stay here until you have need of us."

I smiled, "I will come when you call."  I bowed slightly.  

Valentine chuckled.  "We know you are loyal to a fault."  Valentine hugged me.  I returned the embrace with a smile.  How things had changed.  I didn't even think Valentine liked me once upon a time, I guess I was wrong.

Valentine smiled, "You weren't wrong.  You are being very loud.  I didn't like you once upon a time. It's why your training was slack.  But since coming to the New World, I've come to find you rather comforting in an odd sort of way.  I did not wish  you dead, then or now, and your directness is always refreshing.  I know you think what you say and it's good to have the two minds meeting, unlike other people."

I nodded.  Alec laughed, "You know how I felt about you.  But I also was slack in your training. Though I see you don't need much more than the skill of intimidation.  You are the only vampire I know who pulls it off without trying."  He laughed, "I've seen Francesco and even Tony try.  Only Ant comes anywhere near you."

I smiled, "They just aren't scary.  They are too cute to be scary."  Valentine laughed and nodded.

Alec put his arm around Valentine, "We'll leave you to your packing.  Thank you Il Cane."

"Cari."  I corrected.

He laughed on his way out.  They spoke softly to one another as they parted.  I didn't bother trying to listen.  It didn't matter.   The council was down two members.  I sighed as I thought of Damian and that brought thoughts of Mia.  I fought back the sadness.  Morgan put her hand on my arm, "Mommy?"

I blinked, had she really said something.  I knelt in front of her, "Yes Morgan."

She smiled at me then hugged me, "Don't be sad."

I hugged my daughter.  She was trying to comfort me.  Both of the girls were strong in their respective powers.  It seemed they had split them straight down the middle.  I wondered if they would have any aspects of the other.  But we had years to find out.  "I'll try.  Are you done gathering your things?  We need to go before night ends."

Carissa nodded, "Done."  I smiled and hugged her as well.  

"I'm glad you are learning to speak.  It is music to my ears."  I waved to the other two to join us.  They joined and we fell over, the children in a giggling mass.  

William walked in on us trying to right ourselves.  He watched with amusement in his eyes.  "Il Cane, we wish to speak with you outside, if it pleases you."

I nodded and got up, "Finish getting things together then come outside."  They all nodded and continued their giggling.  I smiled.

I followed William out of the house by the sea where a mass of people stood.  Tony already waited for me with Francesco and Aurora.  I took a spot by Tony.  He put his arm around my shoulders and pulled me close to him.

William nodded to those he was with then he turned to our gathering.  "Il Cane, we offer you replenishment for Il Mandria di Cane.  Our conclave would be honored if you'd take the top choices of our conclave to join you in your travels."

Aurora asked, "Do they know what they offer?"

A woman, I think it was William's daughter answered, "Yes, we offer blood and in return we get long life for as long as we wish it to be."

Ant stepped in next to me.  I hadn't seen him before, he smiled.  Ryan stood next to him.  It was Ryan who spoke first, "It is more than that, but yes I guess that's the gist of it.  Who comes as the offering?"

She stepped forward.  "I am Sarah."

Tony asked, "What did you do before the war?"

Sarah smiled, "I was a school teacher.  I have been teaching the children while they are here."

Tony nodded.  "What would you ask in return for the services you'd render the children of our family?"

Sarah smiled, "Only one thing.  That my children be allowed to travel with us."

Tony looked at me and I smiled they were welcome as far as I was concerned.  "Offer accepted.  But what of your husband?"

Riley stepped forward.  "I am her husband, and I've offered myself."

Ant asked with a smile, "What did you do before the war?"

Riley looked perturbed, "You know what I did."  

His wife poked him, "It's ceremony."

Riley looked ashamed, "I was a Colonel in the marines."

Tony asked, "What would you ask in return for your services rendered to our plans?"

Riley smiled, "Only that my children can travel with us under your protection."

Ryan nodded, "Offer accepted."

Sarah and Riley were waved to come to me.  I sliced my wrist and offered it to Sarah.  She took it and drank deeply.  She offered my her arm.  I spoke the ancient words and bit into her wrist.  She shuttered under my power and I felt her flush with desire.   I withdrew to see her husband staring at her.    I smiled and offered him my wrist and he hesitated before offering me his wrist.  I bit and he gave the same reaction.  I felt them both come into my mind.  They were both foggy with desire.  

Riley stepped in and whispered, "Is it always like that?"

I nodded, "It can be."  He blushed.

Sarah was still red in the face, but she didn't hide her question, "Can we do that together?"

"You mean feed together?"  I looked to Ryan.

Ryan spoke softly, "It's not suggested, but..."  Ryan spoke to the crowd, "Is there another volunteer so that the family that travels with us may feed at the same time."

William smiled, "We have alternates available."

Tony nodded, "Next."

We followed the ceremony to honor the conclave.  Normally we'd not have done so, but it wasn't for us.  There was Andrew.  He used to be a minor political adviser.  He didn't believe he could offer us any advice as we were military so he didn't ask for additional compensation.  I think he would find his opinion would carry weight with most of us.  Advice was advice no matter who it came from.

Trey was a firefighter and asked for no extra compensation.  It seemed to me the conclave didn't think much of their old skills.  We'd value the hero more than thought.  When this war was over, we'd discuss all compensations again.

Chris was a dancer.  I laughed when he said he didn't think he had anything to offer.  But he asked for nothing in return despite my encouragement that he was valuable.

Sam said he was nothing special, a jack of all trades.  He was a contractor for a major construction company.  Nothing was asked for in return.

Mark was the only one who asked for compensation.  He wanted to tell our story.  He was a journalist.  We agreed.

By the time the ceremony was over the children had fallen asleep and daylight approached.  We'd move as soon as night fell again.  It gave the new comers time to gather things together.  And we could make the necessary adjustments to our plan.  Tony, Ant, the children and I all slept in the same bed.   It might be the last bed we'd share for a while.
