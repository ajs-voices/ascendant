# Fortifications

Josh walked me around the compound, from the inside out.  We started with the trap I had first disarmed, he tentatively walked through it.  When he didn't die he literally skipped to the next one.  

I asked, "Who built up the walls?"

Josh looked at me confused.  Tony laughed, "We built what we could to reinforce the ground from above and to make the humans more comfortable as they moved underground."

I was not surprised it was for the humans, "Concrete and steel are more comfortable than stone?"  I shook my head.  I ran my hand along the wall.  "I guess it's not as cold and damp."  Tony put his arm around me as we walked to the next trap behind Josh.

Josh stopped in his tracks.  "This one impedes our food supply, you can destroy it."  

I smiled and touched the barrier.  The hum and fizz of the power returned to where it came from.  Josh looked at me with concern. "Where does that go?"

"The power?"  I asked, to make sure I answered him correctly.

"That sound was power? Where does it go?"  Josh was curious.  

"It goes back to the elements it was created from."

"So you are gaining more power?"  He looked concerned.

"Not really.  But I guess some of it is coming back to me.  That trap was made of electricity, a variant of fire."  It was hard to explain to someone without any magical power.  

He nodded and walked towards the next one.  

By the third one I disarmed Josh was getting more talkative.  "My wife says that vampires are monsters who only want to eat us."

Tony laughed, I did not.  "What do you think?"

Josh shrugged, "I don't know.   We see what they are doing above ground, but there others here who seem to never feed."

Tony smiled, "We feed, but only on the willing.  You can thank Cari for that way of life.  It stems from her need to not hunt."

Josh looked at me.  "I have a friend, he's a vampire now.  He says that you are something to be feared.  But you are just a woman, and no offense, just a small one."

Tony laughed so hard he had to stop walking.  Josh looked at him funny, "Why is he laughing?"

"I am to be feared.  Vampires are one of the many things that go bump in the night.  I'm the one who bumps back."

Tony composed himself to explain, "She is Il Cane, The Hound or Death to others.  She was the controlling force The Council used to keep their kingdoms in line.  She was meant to be scary."

"I don't believe she could do that.  You are so afraid, so lost in your own head to be much help in this war."  Josh stated matter of factly.

Tony watched my reaction.  He was stunned that I did nothing and said nothing.  I asked him, "What?"

"You didn't say anything, you didn't get angry, nothing." He paused, "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine.  He's entitled to his opinion.  And he's probably right."  I knew I wasn't up to par.

Tony shook his head.  "When it comes down to it, you will do what needs doing.  You can't do anything else.  It's the way you are wired."

Josh interrupted, "Here is another.  You can destroy this one."

I did and there was a loud pop.  Josh asked, "What was that?"

"That was air returning to the void that was there."  Tony looked at me, "You can't manipulate air."

I smiled at him. "I can't but someone else can.  I didn't say I put them all up.  All the traps are based on wards, I can remove the ward and the other magic dissipates with it."

Tony nodded, "So who did that?"

"I can only surmise, but Ant possibly.  He's the only other vampire who's been in Dangdburgh who can manipulate death magic and the elements.  But it could be the work of two or more vampires."

Tony asked, "Can I try the next one?  Tell me what to do?"

I shrugged I didn't care if he did the rest or not.  He was a smart man he could do just about anything he wanted too.

Josh looked at us, "How sweet, she thinks you are the best thing since sliced bread."

Tony smiled, "I am."

I laughed, "He was born before they started selling sliced bread."

Josh rolled his eyes.

I walked under Tony's arm; I didn't want to be far from him.  I needed his support, but I could feel the hunger pressing on me.

When we stopped again Tony held out his hand feeling for the ward.  He found it.  "Now what?"

"Remove the ward."

"How?" He asked.

"Just will it gone.  Close it however you'd close one you made."  It was obvious to me.

Tony frowned, "I can't sustain a ward for long."

I stood behind Tony and put my arms around his waist, right hand holding my left wrist.  I put my cheek against his back.  "Close your eyes.  Find the base with your power.  Find the latch, the place where the spell started.  And push it apart."

A bright light flashed in the room and Josh yelped.  

"I can't do another.  I have to feed now.  That took a lot of effort."  I nodded and hugged Tony.

Josh looked at us.  "She looks ravenous."  

Tony turned around and picked up my chin so he could look at me.  "She does, doesn't she?  Come one, we'll continue later."  

Josh smiled, "We can strengthen the rest when you are strong enough.  That's all that's left."    

I nodded and Josh was gone.  He left quickly.  Rather we left quickly.  Tony had whisked us away.  I looked up at him, "We could have walked."

He shook his head.  "No, we couldn't wait.  Your eyes have gone red.  They never do that Cari.  You are losing control."

"I don't feel like I am.  I'm just hungry."  I fell to my knees.

Tony scooped me up, "You are more than hungry."

Ryan was there almost in an instant as was Mia.  They each offered me their wrists.  I looked at Mia, she never offered from the vein.  Ryan withdrew his wrist and Mia put her wrist in my mouth, not letting me take no for an answer.  I bit softly into her wrist.  She shuttered.  I stopped.

She looked at me with questioning eyes and asked in her slow soft voice, "What's wrong?"

"You shuttered."  I said flattly.  "I don't want to hurt you."

Mia put her hand on my head and gently guided me back to her bleeding wrist.  "It's okay.  You won't hurt me."

Tony whispered in my ear, "Mia likes to be bitten.  But she only trusts a few of us to do it."

I rested my head against Tony's arm and drank from my longtime friend for the first time.  Her eyes fluttered in enjoyment.  The succubus in me pushed more sex down the line.  Mia's eyes shot wide open, but she relaxed in the sensation as I fed.  I stopped as Mia collapsed from the orgasm she had reached while standing.

She got up quickly, "I'm okay."  She smiled at me giddily, "I'm great."  She looked at me with new eyes.  She asked tentatively, "Is it always like that?"

"It can be."

Ryan laughed, "She didn't think you would be interested in what she enjoyed.  I told her you'd please her if it's what she wanted."

I patted Mia's hand.  "If it's what you want."  She nodded enthusiastically.  Nearly eight hundred years after we'd first met, Mia had taken an interest in sex.

I looked up at Tony, "Feed, Ryan can take care of me while you are gone."

Tony set me down on a cot.  "She needs more."  He looked to Ryan and Ryan smiled with a nod.  

"You the boss."  He laughed.

Mia sat down on the cot next to me and whispered in my ear.  "He's sexy."  She blushed and I nodded.  "He won't feed on me."

I turned to her, "You don't want him, if you want more than what we just did talk with Damian."  She blushed more.  "You don't want to ask?"

Mia shook her head.  "I'll ask him for you.  In two days when you can feed someone again, go to him."  

She smiled at me and then kissed my cheek.  "I love you, I missed you."

I hugged Mia.  "I missed you too."  I paused carefully before telling her I loved her too.

Mia left to go find something else to do.  Ryan sat down next to me with questioning eyes.  "She wanted to be with Tony."

"What did you tell her?"  He really wanted to gauge my reaction to someone wanting the man who I had loved for nearly eight hundred years.

"She didn't want him.  I didn't tell her why though, but I told her to be with Damian."  Ryan looked at me with a question in his eyes.  I smiled.  "I didn't tell her he wouldn't use his power like that."

Ryan nodded, "You don't think he would for her?"

I shook my head.  "He wants it to be real.  He can persuade a woman to his bed without the bite.  He won't use it to make them feel more than what he can offer in bed."

"In other words he doesn't want to set the bar too high."

I nodded.

Ryan offered me his arm, "No sex for me."  

I laughed and then bit his arm.  Ryan's eyes fluttered for a moment before the feeling passed and he let me feed in silence.  When I withdrew Ryan looked at me, "Why is it always so much on the initiation?  I've always wanted to ask."

Damian answered behind him, "Because it's the venom of our bites, it's meant to be intoxicating so we can drink your blood.  Cari pulls back on it, but she can't until she's started the blood flow. He looked at me, you beckoned."

I nodded, "I have a favor to ask you."

He smiled, "You can't feed on me too."

I laughed, "Mia wants a vampire with your talents."

He sat down on the other side of me, "I heard she was getting a taste for the candy."

Ryan reached around me and smacked Damian in the head, "That's my sister you are talking about."

Damian smiled, "And what would you have me do?"

"Whatever she wants of you."

Ryan laughed, "Cari gave her a taste, Mia's big O made her fall down."

I smacked Ryan's leg, "I don't think she wants just that.  And I don't think she's interested in women or I would oblige her."

Damian smiled, "I always forget you could care less about the gender of your sexual partners.  It always amazed me when one of the girls wound up in your room naked."

Ryan's mouth fell open.  Damian laughed, "For you my pet anything."  I thanked Damian with a kiss on his hand.

Damian left me alone on the cot with Ryan.  Ryan started at me. "Now I can't get the thought of you and a hottie in bed together."  

I smacked his leg then kissed him softly.  "I prefer men."  I got up started walking.  I walked what felt like forever.  I was trying to find my room.  I was trying to get my barrings.  I found myself in the armory.

I had an idea.  I left the armory and went to find Josh.  

I found him in the cafeteria with a pretty young girl.  "Josh, when you are done, I can finish what we started.  I have an idea; I need to get some things together.  Find me in the armory when you are ready."

He finished his mouthful, "Okay.  Cari, this is my wife, Sarah.  She wanted to meet the famed Il Cane, and here you are."

I held out my hand and Sarah looked at it with fear.  "I smiled, I don't bit unless you tell me I can.  I can offer you my hand without you worrying about such things."  I took my hand back and held it out again, with my palm upward facing, "This means I'd like to feed."  I turned my palm to the side, "This is how do you do."

She looked up at me with a smile.  "No one ever explained it to me before.  They just said never give a vampire your hand."

"Well I wouldn't give my hand to a vampire outside this compound."   I looked at Josh, "When you are done."

Sarah stood up and hugged me, "Thank you for helping us."  I stood there a bit stunned and patted her back awkwardly.

I left to find the laundry area.  I needed some large sheets or something.  It wasn't hard; there were only so many places in the catacombs to find water.  I found a few large sheets.  I didn't know how many I would need.  I then headed to the armory.

About twenty minutes later Josh joined me with a smile. "My wife likes you."  I smiled back.  "So what do you need?"  

"I got it all; just take me to the barriers."

Josh looked around, "Where's Tony?"

I shrugged.  He smiled, "I thought you two were joined at the hip."

"He's probably with his human girlfriend."  There was no jealousy in my voice, why should I care who he slept with now.  Josh looked at me like I was an alien again.  He shook his head but left it alone.  He led me to the first barrier.  "This one we've had firefights through.  No one is there right now because we just took them all out, and reinforcements haven't arrived.

I took a spike out of the bag of things I'd grabbed from the armory and threw it at the top of corner of the archway where the ward started.  Then I threw one on its opposite wall.  On the spike were strings that I used to wench up the sheets.  I pulled them tight and now a sheet hung between us and the barrier.  I stood between the barrier and the sheet and I blurred the sheets reality to look like a cave in.  Shadows were easy to manipulate into whatever you needed the viewer to see.  

I turned and touched the barrier and gave it more strength.  I made the ward stronger, it pulsed with energy.  No one would get through.

Josh lead me to the remaining two barriers and I gave them the same treatment.   Josh had never asked me what I was doing.  I guess he trusted me.

When we were done, I asked, "Josh, can you take me back to my room.  I can't seem to find it."  

He smiled and nodded.
