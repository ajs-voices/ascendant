# The Last Battle

The baubles were made, the plans were changed to include everything we had just done.  Everyone knew what they were supposed to do and it still would not go as planned.  Things never went as planned in war or much of anything I ever did.  Free will had a large hand in everything we did and this was no different.  Brandon and Desmond could do something we didn't expect.  Or we could have a traitor in our mists.  Nothing was certain, other than the fact that we were going to do this at first light.

Dawn came quickly for most.  They'd spent too much time celebrating.  That was the way with all wars, the soldiers needed that little bit of fun to think about going to their deaths.  I knew we'd have losses.  I knew we'd all lose friends.  We would all hurt when this was over, but it was a necessity if we wanted our freedom back.

Ant was going with Dimitri and the Therians to prepare our escape route.  Tony, half the hunters and citizens of New Haven who volunteered were going to free the humans that were being held in DC as cattle.  Francesco was taking more vampires to the opposite side of the compound and Donatello took more to the front gate.  While myself, Ryan, and the remaining hunters and the elite forces of the Therians and vampires shadowed into the middle of the compound.

It was all about timing and throwing the enemy off guard.  Five simultaneous attacks while most vampires slept that was the plan.  

Once things started we wouldn't know what was happening with the remaining part of the plan.  We had to hope everything was going smoothly.  The walk into the White House was easy but once we were in guns were firing in every direction.  Some of the hunters dropped, but most hid behind the vampires and Therians with us.  We moved quickly in the direction Brandon was.  Desmond would either be with him or not, it didn't matter.  Once the head was cut off the better off we'd be.  That was our job.  Desmond would be icing on the cake.

The farther we got into the building the more silver was being used.  I felt the sting of silver in the bullet wounds.  And we started to lose vampires and Therians alike.  But we kept going.  I cut down men and vampires with my swords.  We broke necks and pushed and fought our way through the halls.  We left a bloody path behind us.

Brandon was dangerous we all knew that.  We could never catch him. He seemed always one step ahead of us.  We had gone through almost all of the corridors tracking Brandon until it was only Ryan and I left.  We clung to the hopes we'd kill him, but that was also when we started to see Brandon flee the area.  He had been spying on us with our own men.  Ryan and I were not so easy to use like that.  We finally had a leg up.

Everything was such a blur of movement.  Hours could have past, and it could have been mere minutes.  Everything was moving so quickly there was little time to think beyond the initial goal - kill Brandon.  Brandon's men had all but been exhausted; with all our losses they took their own as well.  Brandon was surrounded by fewer and fewer of his men as we took them down.

We finally had Brandon cornered, we'd tracked him into a storage room; he'd thought was something else apparently.  He throw flames at us that Ryan's bauble absorbed and with the new found power Ryan drew dual flaming swords and he rushed Brandon.  With a fling of his hand Ryan flew to the wall cracking his head hard and slumping to the ground.

Brandon laughed, "You forget what I am."

I shook my head, "No I did not."  And in one moment, one fleeting moment, Brandon screamed in agony as his body and clothes leapt into flames.  Brandom furiously fought the elements, but he was not adept in that side of things.  While his body burned Brandon tried to break into my mind.  He tried to pry his way past my shields.  He tried to control me, tried to stop me in the only way he knew how.  

I could feel the pain radiating from him. He was burning alive and healing all at the same time.  But he couldn't stop either, he burned and I fought back the urge to vomit then and there.  Brandon pulled out a gun and I could hear the hissing of his hand burning against the excessively hot metal.  He pointed it at me and the flash of the muzzle was the last sight I saw before I flew across the room.  I heard the distinct sound of silver scorching tissue.  I didn't look back, I gathered my senses quickly before Brandon could turn the gun upon me again.  In a movement quicker than the human eye could see I sliced cleanly through Brandon's neck.  Blood gushed everywhere as he head toppled from his body.  The flames continued to burn with out any hindrance and there was little left of Brandon Holt by the time I turned around to see Tony lying on the ground in a heap.
