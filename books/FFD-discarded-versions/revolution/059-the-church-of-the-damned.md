# The Church Of The Damned

We probably were as ready as we'd ever be.  I still wasn't looking forward to the Church of the Damned.  It had been several centuries since I had last been there.  The protective wards were dangerous to even those who knew about them.  The hardest part was probably going to be to convince those going with me that they could actually walk on sacred ground.  Beliefs were a very hard thing to break, but if no magic was present it was breakable.

Tony decided it was best to go under the cover of night.  Not that it mattered either way, but breaking and entering in the middle of the night was easier to get away with, though I had my doubts about it.  We would see once we got there.

We walked to shadows outside of the city of Dangdburgh; we didn't know what traps might lay in the city itself.  The areas outside the compound had been abandoned for a few months now.   The ground was charred but the smell had vanished.  It was really too bad that we couldn't get into the compound, we were so close to the entrance now.  But it had collapsed with many of the tunnels because of the bombing Brandon and Valence set their men upon the revolt against their New Order.  It would have been so simple.  But what keeps us out, keeps them out too. 

Tony turned to the men behind us.  "You all go check the entrances to the compound.  Maybe we'll get lucky."  The men saluted and they headed off behind us.  We doubted they would find anything, but we can't be absolutely sure, so we checked.  That left me, Tony, Ant, Ryan and three other, one vampire and two Therians to go into the city and find the Church of the Damned and hope we could get through the catacombs that way.  It also was a long shot with all the bombing, but it was our only way in without excavating the compound.  The only other way in was through enemy territory, and that was not going to work for most of us.  I had my reservations and I knew my estate better than anyone else, but no one wanted to risk it.

The city use to bustle at night.  It was home to many vampires before the war.  Now it seemed that it was a ghost town, nothing moved, there were no sounds.    While that fact made it easier to get around, it also made it harder.  If we were spotted it would most likely be by an enemy and we'd be fighting our through the city.  We stayed in the shadows of the buildings as we walked the deserted streets of the city.  There was devastation everywhere.  This was once a home for peaceful existence, but now it was a reminder of the destruction vampires could do on humans around the world.  Dangdburgh was not the only city where vampires lived in harmony.  In fact most cities around the world housed vampires.  And the humans never even knew their existence.  

Life after this was going to be dangerous.  Humans were not tolerant souls. My biggest fear is the genocide of vampires by the remnants of these survives.  Vampires were a danger.  Even if it was vampires that would save them, I feared the worst.

Everyone but me seemed to be on their toes.  I was not afraid of what lie on the streets.  I was afraid of what we would find in the Church.  As my own thoughts drifted to the dangers we'd find hiding in the darkness the Roman Catholic Church came into view over the tree tops.  I took a deep breath and hoped being alive was not going to hinder our passage.

The church was like any other Roman Catholic you would find anywhere in the world.  Its steeples jutted high into the sky and the architecture was grand.  It was a beautify building, and one of few that had remained untouched by the ravaging of the city.  

Ryan, Ant and Tony started to walk through the gates.  I held my arms in front of them to stop them.  It was the last thing we needed was to have my family burnt to a crisp for not paying attention.  "Traps."

Tony and Ant held out their hands to feel for the wards to be triggered, but they found none. I spoke softly, "They are veiled."

Ryan looked at me, "You put them there?"

I nodded, "Only humans may pass unhindered."

Ryan went to take a step and I grabbed his arm.  "You are Chevalier let's not take the risk."

He smiled and nodded his thanks.  The three men behind me had our backs, but I could tell they were afraid.  Fear was good, as long as it didn't make you cower.  I hoped these men were not cowards.

I unveiled the wards and Tony and Ant pulled their hands away in surprise.  It was like setting a blaze suddenly.  I undid the ward and everyone but Tony and the other vampire walked across the threshold to the church.  Sacred ground would be hard to break if you believed it was sacred.  Tony and all primeval vampires were raised to believe in whatever religion the masses did.  And sometimes those beliefs carried over into their myths and legends of ire to swat disbelief.  I looked at Tony and smiled.  "Do you trust me?"

He nodded.  "Then believe in me.  Not the church, the gods. Believe in me and I will get you through this."  Tony took a step forward and he did not burst into flames.  He truly believed I would not lead him astray.  I couldn't say the same for the other.  Belief was strong, and if you believed hard enough myth became real when it came to the old magic.  And primeval magic was one of the oldest kinds in the world.  The vampire accompanying us believed he would be struck down by a bolt from the heavens if he trespassed on sacred grounds.  His belief became reality.  But it wasn't a bolt from heaven, his own magic turned against him and he electrocuted himself.  I sighed and turned toward the entrance of the church.

One of the Therians with us,  "Just like that you can turn away."

I sighed, "We must move forward.  If you feel the need to deal with his corpse now then so be it, but we must move on now."  I turned and raised my hand the body started to burn, and in wit in moments in was nothing but a pile of ash.  I looked to Ant, "A bit of wind?  Clear our tracks."

He smiled and produced a gentle breeze from his hands to scatter the ash from the threshold of the church.  "I can't lay the wards again, it will drain too much and we need the power we all have to get through this."

Ryan asked, "Are we taking everything?"

I shook my head.  "No, I have secondary measures in place to insure the safety of the cache once we get there.  We can't take it all.  One day we can come back and excavate it all and make it safe again."

They let me take the lead.  They didn't want to fry their own selves.  I was glad to take point.  The entrance to the church was going to be the most difficult to get past.  It relied on someone on the inside.  I clanged the knocker in a specific pattern.  Three quick raps followed by two long.  I hoped the years were good to the priests inside.  I only hoped their predecessors passed on the information.

An elderly man pulled open the doors.  They seemed a might heavy for the frail man before us be he opened the doors effortlessly.  He looked at the people behind me then looked down at me.  "I thought you'd be taller."

Ryan and Ant laughed behind me.  I shook my head. They were always being silly at the worst of times.  I just waited for him to ask what he was supposed to ask.  He stared at me in confusion.  "Oh, yes.  I remember now.  I am lighter than a feather, yet no man can hold me for very long. What am I?"

"A breathe."  The veil shimmered in front of us.

The man asked the next question, wonderment in his eyes, "Feed me and I live, give me something to drink and I'll die. What am I?"

"A fire."  The ground shook below us.

"The more you have of it, the less you see. What is it?"

"Darkness."  The veil dropped and the ward was exposed.  I could feel the necromancy radiating from the threshold of the door.

"Until I am measured I am not known, yet how you miss me when I have flown."

"Time."  The wind screamed as the latch of the ward was found.

The last question came, "It is greater than God and more evil than the devil. The poor have it, the rich need it and if you eat it you'll die. What is it?"

"Nothing."  The ward popped and then there was nothing barring our way.

The man looked at me in awe.  "I never knew what that would do."

I smiled, "May we enter?"

He moved from the front of the door.  "Of course.  I am but a humble servant of God."

To each his own, I fought the urge to say it out loud.  The Church was marble and gilded everywhere you looked.  It was a rich church.  The stained glass windows depicted scenes from the bible and the pews were made of mahogany.  A very rich church, thanks to my donations.  It was a small price to keep the artifacts safe.
