# Not Regulation

Josh took me to the hole in the wall closet that I was to call my own.  My weapons still lay on the bed untouched.  I started at them, wondering why for the second time I had not put them on.  I strapped one dagger to my wrist in its sheath, and the dagger on the opposite side.  I pulled my sleeves over the daggers and I felt better already.  I started at the sword on the bed.  I picked it up and strapped the belt to my waist.  I felt more whole.  I felt more like myself than I had all day.

Inside my closet I was alone.  There were no links to anyone.  It was quiet in my mind.  It was frightening.  I found myself curled in the corner of the room shivering.  I wondered if I died in here if anyone would even know something was wrong.

I closed my eyes.  Daylight must be upon us.  In the darkness of the catacombs it was hard to tell.  But I felt weak; I closed my eyes and drifted into to sleep.  I thought it would be peaceful with no external influences but it wasn't.  I had my own nightmares, things that were not from outside.  I watched as I tore a village apart.  I tore men's head from their bodies.  I ripped out throats.  It wasn't like other times where I felt the blood on my hands, their flesh tearing under my fingers.  I watched from a distance.  I watched from someone else's eyes.

My eyes shot open, someone watched me kill that village and didn't try to stop me.  When I looked up in the dim light I saw a man standing above me.  I tried to back away, but I was already in a corner.  He smiled at me.  "You don't remember me do you?"

I blinked.  I shook my head.  I couldn't place him.  I knew I should know him.  

He sneered at me.  "I watched you murder families.  I hated you for it.  I hated you for taking my place.  I wanted to use it against you.  But your Knight in Shining armor came to save you and he and his father whisked you away before I could run and tell our father."

I thought harder, I had no kin.   The man lit a torch and I recognized the man's features in the flickering light.  "Christopher Salmeri, Sal's protégée."  

I stood up.  I couldn't get away from him.  He looked like he wanted to hurt me.  I needed to be on my feet.  He spat at my feet.

I pulled my sword from its sheath.  He stepped back in shock.  "I wasn't spitting on you.  You mentioned Sal.  I hate him more than I hate you."

It was my turn to be shocked.  

"He betrayed us all.  He said we could live in peace with the humans for all of our existence.  Then he sides with the men who would turn the humans into cattle for slaughter.  He needs to die.  I only came to see our so called savior."  Christopher sneered at the thought.  "I thought you would be bigger.  You were easy to manipulate in your dreams.  You are still weak.  Fear consumes you."  

I felt his power wash over me.  He tried to make me afraid again.  I closed my eyes and pulled his power into me.  It tasted like bitter fruit.  It washed over me like a flood.  He tried to let pull back but I wouldn't let him.  I opened my eyes and saw fear in his eyes.  I pulled on his power and he fell to his knees.  

The door burst open and Tony threw the man out of my room and pinned me to the wall.  "Let him go."

I looked into Tony's eyes.  He spoke softly, "He's on our side.  Let him go."

I did as he asked and I heard the man cry out in relief.  "He started it."  It sounded childish as soon as I said it.

He hugged me tightly.  "I couldn't feel what was wrong, but our power alarms went off.  Someone was using their powers stronger than regulations allowed.  One of the necromancers pointed in the direction of your room.  I came as fast as I could."

Christopher stood in the doorway.  "You don't care if I'm alright.  You're as much of an ass as she is."

Tony turned on him with fury in his eyes.  "You used fear on Il Cane, what did you expect."   He stalked towards the man and Christopher took a step back, "She could have eaten you for supper if I hadn't stopped her.  You want me to care when you put yourself in danger."  Christopher's back was against the wall, he shook in fear.  "You took advantage of her disconnection.  I have no sympathy for you.  Get out of my sight."  Christopher turned and tried not to run away.  He only mildly succeeded.

The hallway was full of people with weapons drawn, Tony stood in the middle in a rage I had never seen him in.  Tristan put his hand on Tony's shoulder and Tony turned his fury on his friend.  It quickly faded and Tristan smiled back at his friend.  "Everything's okay.  It's good to know the sensor's work."  Tristan peaked in the door and saw me cowering in the corner again.  He smiled at me but turned back to Tony, "You have work to do in there; I don't think she likes the room."

A figure slipped behind the men and shut the door behind her.  I looked up to see the small slip of a girl staring down at me with concern.  It was the girl who was flirting with Tony earlier.  She knelt in front of me.  My sword was leaning against my forehead.  She pushed it aside, catching her little finger on the edge.  She stuck the cut in her mouth and sucked on it.  And smiled at me, she offered me the cut.  "Are you hungry?"

I stared at her; I didn't know what to think.  She moved her hand closer and when I didn't react she let the blood drip on to my lips, "It's okay, I know you won't hurt me."

I licked my lips, the taste of blood made my eyes roll back.  She put her finger in my mouth and I let the blood flow down my throat until the wound was closed.  I opened my mouth and she pulled her finger out and smiled.  "You love Tony don't you?"  She smiled.  "It's okay.  I knew you'd come and I knew I'd let you take him back."  She hugged me, "Take care of him."  A tear slid down her cheek.  I wiped it away.  She beamed at me.  "I know you will."  She stood up and turned to see Tony standing behind her.  She gave him a hug then kissed him goodbye.

He stood there in silence.  

We sat in silence for what seemed like forever.  He watched me shiver in the corner.  He didn't know what to make of me, and I didn't know what to think of myself.  I was a mess and that thought made me cry.  He grabbed my hands and pulled me to my feet and then scooped me up in his arms.  He left the room.  He didn't say where he was going he just carried me like a child.  It would have made me angry if it were anyone other than him.
