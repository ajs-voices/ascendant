# Oblivion

I dropped the men on the floor and they landed with a thud.  I kicked over the bed and started tying them to the spring frame below the bed.  Someone knocked on the door, I ignored it.  I heard a familiar voice on the other side but I couldn't recognize whose it was.  "Car, you okay in there?"  The door knob started to turn.  I grabbed it to hold it shut.  

The person banged on the door.  "Cari you okay?"  he called down the hall, "Get someone here quickly."

In a moment there was people outside the door, but the easiest way in was not threw the door and Tony was standing in front of me in the shadows.  He stared at me before he looked down and saw what I'd brought to play with.  He looked up at me.  There was fury in his eyes, but it faded quickly into hatred for the man below him.  He fought the urge to kick him while he slept.  He walked over to me carefully; he didn't want to give in to his primal beast.  He hated Johnny more in that moment that I'd seen Tony hated anyone ever.  

He stood in front of me as superior, not as friend or lover, he stood there as my boss.  "Let it go."  I dropped let go of the handle, he pushed me out of the way and he opened the door.  "Get a lock up room."  There was a murmur though the hall.  Tristan stood in the doorway; he had been the one banging on the door.  Tony flung the door open to reveal the presents I had brought them.  "She's been busy while she's been gone."  He didn't look back at me as he left the room.  Tristan stared at me, for that matter everyone stared at me.

I heard someone say, "How's she standing with that many bullets?"  

I looked down and my clothes were torn to pieces.  They were hanging by threads; it was a feat that they hung there at all.  

I walked out of the room through the crowd of people.  I was at peace with myself.  I knew everyone was angry at me.  But I was at peace with myself.

I walked in circles around the compound.  I didn't have any place to go.  Every so often I'd hear a clink on the ground as a bullet fell from my body.  I was healing slowly, but I was healing.  I just walked.  No one stopped me; no one asked me what I was doing.  I just walked.

I walked for hours.  Just around in a circle around the compound.  About the third pass people started to mutter as I passed them.  They were concerned.  I found myself walking past an open room, I heard yelling coming from the room.  Tristan was yelling at Tony.  I stopped and listened. 

"It was your job to keep her at bay.  She could have brought them down on us.  She didn't think.  Does she ever think?"  Tony was getting in trouble for my actions.  I stepped into the room.  Tristan turned his fury on me.  "And she doesn't even mind her own business."

Tony looked at me like I was the enemy.  I ignored his abuse and I turned to Tristan with a cold voice, "I need no baby sitter.  You want to yell at someone, Yell at me.  He had nothing to do with my actions.  He is not my guardian."  

Tristan took a step back.  He was afraid of me.  I took advantage of it, "They wouldn't have tracked their own people.  Not one who was loyal to Sal.  He's their right hand isn't he?"

"You don't know that for sure."  

I looked at him with a glare of hatred how could someone be so stupid? "I've known Valence his entire vampire life.  Loyalty is life.  Loyalty to his own measly skin but he expect everyone to be like him.   He would have fought any tracking of the people.  He has the perfect tracker in Sal.  He can track all my kin, just as Sal can track all Valence's kin.   I brought him to the one place no one could find him.  He was cut off from the world.  You brought him out."

Tristan looked almost abashed, but the fury was in his eyes.  He didn't know what to say.  

"So yell at me.  Tell me I'm unfit to be in your service and I'll go.  I'll leave you to your battle.  But I will take my presents with me.  All of them, even the ones you gained while I was asleep."

Tony grabbed my arm, he was pleading with me.  I shook of his hand.  He grabbed me and turned me to him.  "You can't.  You can't leave us again."

I sank to my knees, he still hated me for leaving.  I didn't cry.  I didn't move, I just lay in a ball at his feet.  They stared at me.

Tristan walked over and kicked me in the side.  "Get up"

I did not.  He kicked me again.  I still didn't move.  He kicked again and I caught his leg and pulled it from underneath him.  He fell smacking his head against the floor.  I crawled over his body and got in his face.  "Kick me again and see how long you live."  Tony pulled me off of Tristan and threw me against the wall.  

"You okay?"  Tristan sat up and rubbed his head.  

"Yeah.  I should have known better.  After the second one I felt her anger rise, but I didn't care."

I lay crumpled on the floor where Tony left me.  I sank into slumber.  I couldn't stay away anymore.  I slept the dreamless sleep of the undead.

When I woke I was in Tony's bed.  He wasn't anywhere to be found.  There were torches in every corner burning bright; they weren't going to let me do that again.  I lay back in the bed.  I felt Johnny's laughter in my mind.  I tried to block him out.  But it was over powering.  I focused on the window in my mind.  Their pain was better than Johnny's maniacal laughter in my head.

Hours past and no one came.  My head hurt from the hunger.  I let my family drain me of my energy.  There was nothing more I could do for them.

The door opened and all I heard was "Shit!"

I didn't open my eyes.  I didn't care.  I let myself slip into oblivion.
