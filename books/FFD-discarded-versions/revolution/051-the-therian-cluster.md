# The Therian Cluster

Everyone left the meeting room.  They were talking in hushed tones.  The sun was well into the day.  I was feeling weak, and tired and hungry.  Tony put his arm around my waist, he smiled weakly at me.  "We'll eat after this.   You've had a rough day."

I laughed, that was an understatement.  Three beasts stood on the edge of the forest.  Everyone but Tony and I had stopped to stare in wonderment.  They were unlike any Therian I had ever seen.  They were beasts in man form; it was the only possible way to explain their shape.  A guttural human voice came from the beast man's snout, "We wish to speak to the Vampire Queen."

"I am Il Cane."

The three men bowed deeply.  "We come to request an alliance."

"Funny, I was going to come find your kind to do the same thing."  I smiled and the man who'd spoken grinned at me through his muzzle, it looked more like a snarl than a grin but I knew what it was.  He did not frighten me.

"I am Bernard and my fellows are Carl and Simon.  We are envoys and leaders of the Therian Cluster.  We are the First."

I nodded and bowed slightly to their titles.  They howled in joy.  "You know of us."

"You are the cursed of the First who embraced a human to become vampire."  They howled again.  "You are the parent beings of both cursed vampires and diseased Therians."  They howled again in acknowledgement.

The rest of the circle found themselves at my back in time to hear what I said.  "We seek alliance with Il Cane della Morte.  We wish to put the world right."

I nodded, "What are your suggestions?"

"Come with us, speak to the clusters of Therians and bring with you the best of us to defeat the evils of this world."

"I will take all the help we can get.  But I have something I must do first."

Dimitri stepped out of the ground, the three Therians bowed before him.  "I will go with them Cari, on your behalf.  It would be my honor to be your envoy."

Another of the three spoke, Carl I think is name was, "It would be an honor to have the Beast King amongst us.  He has always been kind to us."

"Dimitri will speak on my behalf.  But he must first go see Alec and Valentine."

Aurora interrupted, "Francesco and I will go tell them.  We have plans to speak to you about as well."

I looked to Tony, he nodded and smiled. "Okay."  The children came running down the hill to the edge of the forest.  Carissa and Morgan hid behind our legs and peered at the great beings before us.  They smiled shyly at three beast men.  Leyla and Lee stood half the distance before they reached us.  They crept up beside us and clung to our legs.  The three men looked at us.  You could see the questions in their eyes, "Your children."

I nodded, "Adoptive, but Family none-the-less."

They bowed deeply to me again.  "She is kind to us."  They backed away into the shadows and Dimitri came to stand before me.  

"I will do my best to honor you, as you have always done for me."  He hugged me and I knew I would not see Dimitri again for a long time to come.

I watched as Dimitri disappeared into the darkening forest.  Night had fallen and I hadn't even noticed.  My stomach grumbled.  I looked down at it like it was some foreign object.  Tony laughed, "You are hungry.  You live. You need both blood and human food.  Both should sustain you, though I know you will always need more blood than most."  He smiled, "You are a blood thirsty little minx." I heard Donatello laugh behind me.

I turned to find only Francesco, Aurora, Donatello and the rest of my clan.  Ryan was carrying a basket with him.  He set it down at my feet and sat down and opened the lids.  Savory and sweet flavors wafted from the basket and my stomach grumbled loader.  I sat down to see what Ryan had brought.  He smiled at me, "I brought only my favorites."

Everyone else sat down and I took a piece of bread first, it stated the grumbling enough so that we could speak uninterrupted.  I looked at Aurora for an explanation.

She smiled, "Francesco and I are going to pave the way across the ocean.  They need to be freed too.  But I've something to tell you.  I've a secret I've not told you."

I took a bit of a red berry and it melted in my mouth.  I looked at Ryan, "Strawberry."

I turned back to Aurora and she continued, "The child you had."

I stopped mid chew and stared at her with near disgust.  "I know, I shouldn't have pried but I followed your human blood line, like I would follow my children's vampire lines.  You have a many great grandson who is leading the revolt on the other side of the ocean.  He does not know he is of your blood.   He is doing better than we did, if we help him with the backing of Il Cane, I'm sure we can take back the European governments."

I nodded and took another bite of something sour.  Ryan laughed, "You aren't supposed to eat it like that.  It's a lemon.  Watch.  He squirted it into his drink.  Lemon tea. Drink."

I did, it was okay.  I didn't really want it. I handed it back to him.  He stuck his tongue at me and drank the rest of the cup.  

Aurora interrupted, "That's all you have to say."

"Is it what you want to do?"  She nodded, " Will it help us?"  She nodded again.  "Then what would you like me to say?  To stay, I need you here?  What?"

She laughed, "I should have known your silence was acceptance.  But it would be nice to know that you need us here."

I took something else and took a bite.  I spit it out.  It was disgusting.  Ryan was having fits of laughter.  "You need to peel it.  You really never watched us eat did you?"  He took the yellow thing from me and pulled the skins down, "It's a banana,"

I took a bite, it was much better this time.  "I do need you.  I'd like for you to stay, but what I need or want is not always good for the whole."

Donatello smiled, "She is wise."

Aurora rolled her eyes, "You say that now.  Wait till she's doing it to you.  We've been listening to her direct to the point opinion for 800 years, it's not always nice."  

Donatello laughed, "It's refreshing to know someone means exactly what they say for a change."

Tony and Ryan guffawed.  "Seriously you don't know Cari.  She'll say something sometime that is the truth you'd rather not hear."  Tony leaned back, "Sex is just sex." Ryan and Ant laughed, and the three of them tossed some of my so called favorite sayings back and forth.  I shook my head and finished the banana.  I felt better.  Ryan offered me his wrist and I smiled, I took it graciously.  

Donatello laughed, "I've never seen a teenage vampire eat like her.  Never once has a newling taken both food and blood in the same sitting. A marvel she is."
