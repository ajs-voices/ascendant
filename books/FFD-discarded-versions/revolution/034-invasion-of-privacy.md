# Invasion Of Privacy

My temper always got the best of me.  After walking around the compound twice I found myself standing outside the door to our living space.  It felt odd to me knowing that there were four people behind the door that I loved.  I tried to open the door but it was locked.  I knocked softly so not to wake the girls if they slept.

I could hear them whispering behind the door.  Tristan tried to be quiet, really quiet, but I'm a vampire I heard most whispers when I was this close, "She's back."

Tony was the one who opened the door.  "I didn't expect to see you till it was time for you to sleep."

I didn't know what else to say so I said the only thing that I could think of, "I'm sorry."

Tony smiled and stepped out the door, shutting it behind him.  I took a step back and felt the worst was coming. I looked away from Tony.  I hated feeling this way.  Maybe this is why I never loved anyone.  

Tony picked up my chin and made me look at him, "I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said it.  I know you are trying."

I tried to look away.  I wanted to run away.  I hated feeling like this, feeling…

Tony smiled at me, "You hate feeling like a real person."

I sank into his chest.  I hated being this person.  

Tony lifted my chin again and kissed me tenderly.  Something changed, my doors all unlocked at the same time.  I had little control, I pulled away from Tony.  "Can't."  I closed my eyes and I knew what it was.  Someone was in my mind, someone was making me do this.  I grabbed Tony's throat and he stared back at me, "Can't. Control."

I fought to build my shields around me blocking everyone else.  All I wanted to do was rip Tony's throat out.  I fought the tension I fought the suggestion.  I fought with every fiber of my being not to kill him.  From the closed door behind us I heard, "We have them now."

Tony heard it too and he broke my grip on his throat.  I hadn't been easy but he was physically stronger than I was and I was working to do it myself as well, together he managed to escape and he burst through the door.    I heard Tristan say, "Stronger than I thou..."  And then a thud.  I felt the pressure lessen and then was gone.  Everything was fine, everything was locked up and I hadn't done it.  What had happened?  Tristan lay on the bed and the girls were still sound asleep.  I breathed a sigh of relief and then my shock hit and I was furious.  

Tony stepped in my way, "You can't kill him."

I stared up at Tony with coldness in my eyes.  He took a step back, he knew the look, but he knew it wasn't for him.  It was the look you get when you are about to kill someone.  I said to him in a quiet voice.  "Watch me."

He held me at bay, but I never moved.  I just stared at the man we had loved.  "I know only one person capable of doing what just happened."   Tony didn't ask, but I answered anyway, "Valence."

"He's not vampire.  He's human, we know that."  And then a thought occurred to him, "Could he use his Chevalier like that, or a lesser?"

I nodded, "Yeah, he can do it through any one, he's strong in Necromancy, Auspex and Dream walking."  

Tony's mind raced and he caught another detail, "You saw him and not Virgil."

I shrugged, "I don't know.  I can't say for sure it was a fleeting image."

Tony hugged me, "He's the reason you've been so fritzy lately. I'm so sorry. But what are we going to do."

I pulled away from Tony, "I'm going to kill him, and save us."

"How?"  

"Break the bond between him and you and me."  It sounded so simple.  "It's not done because it kills the person doing the breaking."  I looked up at Tony, "I will need help but I think I can use Valence's trick to do it and save us.  But it could go wrong.  Can you live with that possibility?"

Tony smiled, "I'll be dead so I won't have to.  But Yes, I can live with the possibility of our death if he can't hurt anyone else."

I nodded, "I need Alec and Valentine."  I smiled up at him, "And I need you."  Tony picked up Carissa and I picked up Morgan and they slept in our arms while we found the people we needed.
