# Packing

Nick pulled his shirt over his head then sat down on the bed in front of me and kissed me softly on the lips.  I smiled up at him as I had to do with almost everyone else in my life.  He smiled back but there was sorrow in his eyes and I could feel it radiate from him.  He was also an empath, a unique one at that, Nick could see a person's connections to others in a given area.  It was one of the reasons why he'd turned to drugs and alcohol in the first place.  He couldn't tune anyone else out.  I taught him how and now he was in a much better place, he really didn't need me, even if he felt he did.  

I leaned in and kissed Nick again then whispered to him, "You'll be okay."  Then I remembered the business cards Alison had made.  I leaned over to the pouch I typically worn on my waist instead of a purse or anything of today's world, I relied on the belt pouches of my day.  The business cards were nothing fancy, just the company name and my phone number.  I handed one to Nick, you can call anytime.  

He laughed at me, "You won't answer the damn thing though."

I smiled, "No, but Alison or Ryan will and we'll work out something."  He looked doubtful.  "I promise."  As if those two words meant more to him than anything in the world, he light up like a Christmas tree.

With a smile and a passionate kiss good-bye Nick left and I was alone to do what was required of me.  Normally packing wasn't a big deal, but we had been here too long and things had started to find homes in our rooms.  My clothes were all hung in the closet with care.  My swords were stored neatly in a chest of drawers under several layers of blankets.  It had been a sad day when one of the cleaning boys severed his finger while playing with one of my swords.  Sadly we have never stayed at that place again, but it was hardly a big loss.

Packing was done rather quickly; vampire speed does come in handy.  But then again I had very few possessions with me, most of my belongings were at my estate in Dangdburgh where Mia kept tabs on them and managed the estate itself.

Mia like Ryan meant a great deal to me, they had been with me for eight hundred and twenty-three years.  Their lives were tied to mine; they were my chevalier - guardians during the daylight hours; rather that is what chevalier are to most vampires.  To me, Mia and Ryan were much more than guardians; they were two of a group of humans whom I feed on.

Unlike most vampires I did not hunt my food.  I was serviced by a small group of humans who came with me where ever I went.  Ryan and Mia were only two of the group that history had started calling Il Mandria della Cane, loosely translated to The Hound's Herd.  Allison and five others were part of my extended family; most had been with me for decades, some even centuries.  Allison was the most recent addition to our group, but not by much.

It was a good idea to help the others finish their packing.  Allison was the most likely to have not dented her collection of things.  She was a typical woman.  I knocked on her door and she grinned when she saw my one bag behind me.  "I see you are done.  Good you can help pack the paperwork."

I rolled my eyes.  Of all the people in the world who I could have chosen to help me with managing our day to day business it had to be a pack-rat.  But even though I disliked the wasted paper and tediousness of fulfilling everything Allison wanted, she was probably the best assistant I had ever had.  Allison kept our lives as streamlined as possible.

The desk with all the paper on it was a mess.  Maps and bills and various other pieces of paper were strewn all over the place.  It would take a while just to get them in order.  Allison had given me the job I most hated.  But I was here to help and that was what I was going to do.  

Allison carried on a one sided conversation.  I really had no idea what she was talking about, but then again she could have been talking on the phone.  Phones were getting smaller and Allison like Jack always seemed to have a new one.  I had one but Allison carried it.  I hate almost all technology.  I grew up simple and that was how I preferred it.

Allison turned to see what I was doing, she giggled, "My! That's the best the table has ever looked."  She came over to me and wrapped her arms around my neck, "That's all the help I need, the rest is easy to do.  Maybe Jack could use some help?  We are in a hurry after all."

It sounded like she wanted to get rid of me, and I was more than willing to oblige her of that.  I was betting she was having a conversation with her would be lover Larry.  

Jack's room was across the hall from Allison.  We each had our own room, it was easier that way. Seven of us sharing a room was not good.  The door to Jack's room opened without my knocking, Jack Wynn was a computer god in my eyes.  He had been a hacker, but we had turned his talents to our benefits.  He still got to be bad in the eyes of the law, but he had the safety of numbers now.  Jack looked down at me with puppy eyes.  "Not coming to play are you?"

I shook my head.  Of all the men in my life, Jack was the only one I was never allowed to be alone with.  Jack left the door wide open as I came in.  He had packed up all his personal belongings except for the electronics that were scattered across the room.  Jack had two or three laptops, a few cell phones, a pager and various other small bits and bobs lying around.  I asked, "Is there anything I can help with?"

Jack's eyes said it all, he wanted to play.  I smiled at Jack but stayed away from him, "I'm sorry we don't have time."  The sorry in Jacks face didn't reach his eyes, he was just playing.  Jack was a masochist.  He enjoyed pain; he was by far the oddest of my extended family.  But for all his oddities compared to the others, Jack and I got on rather well, as long as we didn't play the game Jack so loved.  

I couldn't even feed from Jack alone.  Each member of my herd was compensated in various ways, I rarely compensated with sex, but for Jack I made an exception, because what Jack wanted was to be hurt.  While I did pay him, it was icing on the cake for Jack.  He was more than happy if when I feed on him I made it hurt.  This didn't bother me any but then again I also enjoyed inflicting pain upon others, or myself for that matter.  We could not take the chance that Jack or I would not give up the safe word to save our own lives.  

Jack kissed my arm softly, "I'm good here.  Move along before we get in trouble."

It was easy to forget the stakes when with Jack, he was a sweet man and very cute but I left, he was right we couldn't risk it.

There was very little left to do, I felt useless.  Larry and Doc were packing away their few belongings and were chatting away as they helped each other.  Larry grinned when he saw me standing in the door way to his room, "Bored sweety?"

I nodded and he grinned, "I have a joke for you."  Larry's taste in jokes were almost as bad as his taste in women.  But that wasn't saying much for Allison then, they seemed to be having a fling these past few months.  I hoped they were happy, it was rare I took a female companion with so many men.  It always made things easier.

Larry looked across at me with a hurt face but his smile in his eyes told me he was just making fun of me.  I seemed to be the butt of many jokes for him.  With a pout Larry asked me, "Did you think it was funny?"

I just nodded my head as I watched Doc put the handguns in their cases.  "Been practicing?" 

Doc looked up with surprise, "Oh, yeah, we went yesterday.  You should come with us one day.  We all have a bet if you could best Ryan or Ant."

All the men in my family all had gun permits, most of them had them in almost every state we had ever visited.  They all enjoyed their firearms.  I preferred my blades.  I shook my head and Doc nodded, "Ant said you'd say that."

Ryan walked up behind me and I felt his presence long before he put his arm around me as he flipped his phone shut, "Ant said he'd meet us in Dangdburgh."

I nodded.  Ant was my son.  He was out and about doing his own thing for the past few months since we'd stayed in New York City.  He was even more restless than I was.  

We had everything together and in the RV before the hour was out.  We were all ready to go see what the council had in store for us.
