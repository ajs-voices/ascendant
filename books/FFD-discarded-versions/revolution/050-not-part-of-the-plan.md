# Not Part Of The Plan

The magic from the ceremony hung in the air.  I could feel it, it wasn't done, but it waited for something.  Everyone gathered around us and congratulated Tony.  They shook his hand and welcomed him into the Clan.  No one was paying any attention to me nor to the near glow that hung on the air.  I stepped towards the fire and I could feel more power, it wasn't finished but nothing happened.  A woman came near the fire and spoke to me.  "It's not easy being Elder and newly wed.  The Clan does not know what to do around you."

I shrugged, "You don't feel it?"

She looked around, "Feel what child?"

"The magic that's hanging in the air."  

She looked around and concentrated.  "No I'm sorry.  But I am not nearly as strong as you.  I remember when my husband became Elder."

I looked over at her, "Who is your husband?"

She smiled, "You don't know already?"

I turned back to the magic, "I'd guess you are Tony's grandmother."

She touched her nose.  I was right.  "I'm Meelah Lewis-Giovanni."

I turned and bowed, "A pleasure to meet you.  What's with the dual last name with ya'll?"

"Do you not wish to keep your last name?"

I laughed.  "I think Cari Giovanni-Giovanni would be a bit much."

Meelah laughed, "You are probably right."  She stopped a moment and leaned in, "The girls are Marshall-Giovanni."

I sighed and turned back to the magic lingering.  "We thought they were from two different fathers.  But he betrayed us and the girls are both clearly linked to Tony.  He manipulated things to make us believe what he wanted us to."

He patted my back.  I stared at the lingering magic, it was building.  I felt things low inside me stir.  I whispered, "The consummation."

"Pardon?"

"That's why the magic is lingering."  I was slowly figuring it out.

"Usually it is part of the ceremony, but we don't normally preform the ceremony on prior mated souls.  You still feel it?"

I nodded, "I see it."

Meelah turned to leave, "I will speak with my husband."

I turned to stop her but I caught sight of Tony and I knew what had to be done.  I pushed my way through the crowd.  I took Tony's hand and lead him to a bare patch of ground and took off my shirt.  The crowd parted and the chattering stopped as they all watched.  I pulled Tony close to me.  I smiled up at him.  "They want this.  Can you, for me?"

Tony nodded and kept his eyes on me.  He blushed but he took off his shirt and I nestled my face into the crook of his neck and I took in his scent.  I had a sudden urge to bit him.  He pulled me away from him and he pulled my clothes from my body kissing my body as he removed them.  I unbuttoned his pants and we stood naked in the middle of the mountain sanctuary.  We were not alone, but there was nothing but us and the magic.

Tony picked up my chin, you are ripe.  I nodded, "Its okay.  Trust me.  I trust them."

He kissed me, "Who?"

I lay down on the earth beneath our feet pulling Tony on top of me.  I still had the urge to bit him, "The spirits, the magic, the earth.  I don't know, but we must do this."  I kissed his neck and he moaned with pleasure.  I bit his neck and drank of his blood.  His head reeled back and he drove himself inside of me.  We made love and it was probably the best we'd had in a very long time.

I felt the magic flow inside me as my body spasmed in the last climax I gasped for air.  I chocked on air coming into my lungs.  I felt my heart beat.  I shuttered with the magic flowing through me.  Tony grabbed me and tried to stop me, he tried to understand.  My eyes rolled into the back of my head and there was nothing but the searing pain.

When I woke I was staring into the bright sun overhead.  I panicked.  I sprang to my feet searching for cover.  I was alone.  Why was I alone?  I blinked and saw figures materialize out of nothing.

Three souls who were gone stood before me in wide smiles.  Thea reached her hand out, "Calm, Cari.  You are not dead, far from it.  You must breathe"

Mia took my hand, "Calm Cari.  Breathe.  Live"

A woman I barely remembers smiled at me.  "Prophecy fulfilled.  Potential gained.  Breathe child"

I took a deep breath and I woke to Tony cradling my head in his lap, rocking back and forth.  I opened my eyes and saw a circle of people around me.  Ant put his hand on Tony's shoulder.  "She's okay.  Look she's breathing."

Tony looked at me, "What the hell was that?"

I tried to sit up but Tony kept me lying down.  "Sit still until Father can look at you."

I only stayed because it wasn't worth fighting.  "I saw Thea's grandmother, the one who bound us."  Tony looked at me in silence, he knew who I meant.  "She said, prophecy fulfilled, potential gained.  Do you know what she meant?"

He pulled me up into his arms and hugged me tightly, "I always thought she meant your death."

I smiled, "Maybe it was at the time, but I don't think so."

I turned around and sat myself in his lap facing him. I wrapped my body around him, we were both still naked and it was probably not a good idea.  I buried my face into his neck.  I whispered, "I hear my pulse, I need to eat, or it's going to drive me insane."  I took a deep breathe.

Tony picked me up and carried me to someplace I couldn't tell, he sat me down and threw a blanket at me as he pulled one around himself.  "I'll bring you Andrew.  It's his turn."

I nodded and I sat on the couch, trying to remember to breathe.  Over eight hundred years of not having to my body has having a difficult time adjusting.  I held my arms in front of me and watched my pulse race.  I fought the urge to bit myself.  It would do little good.  I don't know how long I stared before Tony returned with Andrew and Trey.  Tony took my wrists and made me look at the men before me.  Andrew offered me his wrist.  I only had eyes for the pulse in his throat.  He smiled and turned his back and knelt before me.  I wrapped my arms around him and smelled the soft scent of his skin before sinking my fangs into his neck.  

The copper liquid tasted far greater than it had ever before.  Tony had to pull me off of Andrew.  I licked my lips, "I'm sorry."  

Andrew laughed, "It's okay.  I don't think I've ever felt anything like that, not even before when you fed.  It wasn't the same, it was better."

Trey handed me his wrist and I took the offering, before biting, "Take no offense, I don't want Tony to have to pull me off of you."  

Trey smiled, "Thanks."  I bit into his wrist and it was much easier to pull free.  But I wasn't sure I liked this new found thirst.

Tony laughed, "You feed like a teenager on their first feeding."  His own words made him sit down in stunned silence.  "You are reborn."  He turned to me, "Did you know this would happen?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I just knew we had to."

He put his hand on my belly.  "The child was there, I felt conception.  But it's not there now."

I smiled, "I don't think it was ever a real child."  

Meelah stepped out of the shadows, "Your grandfather believes that the child was just a form of her rebirth.  She is Clan."

I took another deep breath, nearly gasping for air.  This was going to take time and the only thing I could hear was the blood rushing through my veins.  Tony said something but I hadn't heard.

He grabbed my hand and I turned to look at him, "Cari?  Are you okay?  Nana, she's turning blue."

I gasped for air.  I concentrated on my breathing, Meelah smiled, "She's been dead for almost a millennium, what did you expect?"

I tried to talk but breathing and talking were difficult.  I tried again, "All I hear is my pulse."

Tony smiled, "You hear everyone else's all the time.  Focus on something else."  I glared at him.  "I know I don't know what you feel, but focus on something else."

Ryan came in carrying my weapons.  He laid the swords on the couch where I sat.  "The girls thought it wasn't a good idea to have them out.  I agreed.  Can you tell me what happened?  Ant's different.  He's staring at the east horizon."

I turned to Meelah, she shrugged.  "How soon till sunrise?"

Tony panicked, "Not long.  I feel it coming up."

Aurora and Dimitri came running inside and skidded to a halt, "We can't feel her.  She's no longer here, we thought the worst."

Tony smiled, "She'd probably agree that it's pretty bad right now."

I stared at my swords, not really caring about anything.  "Get Ant inside to be safe."

Ryan laughed, "I already tried. He won't come."

I started looking around.  Meelah handed me a simple dress.  I pulled it on and went outside.  The sun was starting to rise.  The shadows were long but most of the village was covered in shadows still.  I made my way to the edge of the village and saw Ant standing in the first sunbeam of his life.  He didn't burn.  He stood bathed in the golden glory.  He turned and stared at me.  He smiled.  I walked out to him and the sun was warm on my skin but it didn't burn.  The light hurt my eyes.  

"Close your eyes."  He pulled me towards him and wrapped me in his arms.  We both basked in the sun.

I heard others coming up.  I heard the girls running from sunbeam to shadow in fits of giggles.  I felt Tony through our numerous connections, he seemed overly joyous.  

Meelah and others asked, "What are they doing?"

Tony laughed, "This is Ant's first sun beam ever, and Cari hasn't felt the sun's warmth in as many years."

I spoke softly to Ant, "I can't think with this pulse."

Ant held me softly, "We can fix that.  Just wait."

I felt another person coming at a run.  But what I heard made me feel stupid.  Ryan was coming with my swords.  I smiled at Ant.  I tried to open my eyes, but the sun was too bright.  Even with my back to the rising sun.  Tony said, "Just keep them closed, we'll find you something until you are used to the sun."

Tony strapped the swords to my waist.  

More people from the crowd wondered what I was going to do.  I drew the sword from my sheath, the ring of the steel made my heart sing.  I swung the sword through the air and listened to the whistle of the metal moving through the air.  I focused on the steal, the sounds of the earth under my bare feet.  I focused on anything and everything except the pulse in my ear.  

I felt people come and go as I moved through the motions.  I stumbled over my own blade, my feet.  Ant steadied me, "You have a new beat, listen to it.  Use it."  He was taking his instructor tone with me.

I listened to my heart and tried to find the new rhythm.  I couldn't see the crowd that had formed but I could feel people watching me.  Tony called out, "Stop."  I made the put the sword into an off sheath position.  I could feel him walking towards me.  He placed something on my face.  "Open your eyes, slowly."

I tried to.  I blinked and the world was darker.  I touched my face with my free hand.  He'd found sun glasses, I smiled at my love.  I kissed him.  He smiled, "I knew you'd like that, we'll find you a better pair, but these will do for now."

Ant laughed, "Why don't I need them?"

Tony shrugged, "Dude, I don't know, but probably because you were already living.  Apparently the change in your mother went down to her children.  She changed your entire line."

A small voice from the crowd, "You've sent the Elder's into conclave.  They are discussing things."  I didn't recognize the voice, I turned to find it.  And when I did I was surprised to find a small girl.  

I knelt down to her level. "Do you think I should be there?"

She shook her head in embarrassment, "I'd rather watch you."  A chorus of other children shouted "more"

I smiled and I obliged them.  I nodded to Ant to continue.  I had taught him so many years ago, it was his turn to help me find my footing again.  

Tony laughed, "I bet we could beat her now."

Ant smiled, "For about another hour.  But after that I won't take that bet."

Ryan nodded and Tony laughed they all drew their swords.  "First blood?" I asked.  All three agreed.  I smiled, "Do I have to bleed you all or just one?"

Ant looked at Ryan, Ryan smiled, "All of us."

I nodded.  "Rules established, shall we?"

I pushed the nose piece of the sunglasses up and drew both my swords.  Ryan called, "No fair", I smiled.

They circled me, and I focused on my own heart beat and theirs.  I found my rhythm.  I dodged the first attack.  The sunglasses kept slipping.  I closed my eyes and tossed them out of our area.  Tony sighed, "She's going to kick our asses."

I focused on their sounds, their heart beats.  I found mine and I moved to them.  I blocked and parried.  I slashed and thrust at the men circling me.   There was nothing but the battle.  Nothing but the sound of steel on steel.  It was a glorious day.  The sun beamed down on us, the swords rang against each other as we fought.  I drew first blood.  I do not know which of the three it was, but it didn't matter.  None were easy to beat.  

We circled each other and  I drew blood on another.  The last was being more cautious, I could feel him trying to change his own rhythm.  I knew it had to be Tony.  He was the only one who could read me.  But for that advantage it was also a disadvantage I could read him.  I thought too much and I was there before he was and I drew blood.  I smiled.  I held my hand out and a small hand put the glasses in there.  I nodded.  "Thank you."

I put the glasses back on and opened my eyes slowly.  I found the sun to be high in the sky.  Tony smiled as he put his arm around me, "How's the pulse?"

"Better."  I hugged him.  I held my arm out to Ant and Ryan.  "Thank you.  Who'd I bleed first?"  Ryan raised his hand.  I hugged him and kissed his cheek.  I went to Ant.  I bowed to him. "Thank you."  He hugged me and I returned it.  

"You are welcome.  I was hoping to beat you once, but you found yourself."  Ant smiled.  "Maybe one day."

"Maybe one day."  I agree.

Meelah came out of a building with a smile, "If it please the lot of you, we'd like your presence in the conclave."

Tony asked, "All of us?"

Meelah nodded and we all followed.

The room the conclave was in was huge for the size of the building.  It was covered in things of unknown decent and many things shimmered with veils.  I smiled as their words became clear to me as I walked past them.  

A round table stood before us.  "As new clan members we ask that you unshield and unveil in this room so we may assess your potential and rank you accordingly."

I closed my eyes and unshielded and unveiled myself.  The room shimmered as my power touched it.  There was stunned silence and then a murmur rose, "A true keeper?"

For once it wasn't the vine tattoo that brought their eyes.  Tony unveiled and his power fell in with mine and the room glowed brighter.  I was thankful for the sunglasses, but no one seemed to be squinting.  Ant followed suit and the room grew brighter.  I shielded my eyes.  Francesco's power made me close my eyes completely.

Tony put his hand on my shoulder.  "You can shield, it's over and you can open your eyes.  Only the eldest can see the powers in this room."

I sighed, "I don't want to be Eldest."  

"Everyone take your seat.  It will glow only for you."  Donatello called the meeting to order.

I stood where I had as I saw the seat that glowed for me.  There was no head of the table, but I knew what that seat meant opposite the door.  I was the most powerful vampire in the Clan.  I was not just Elder, I was Eldest.  

To my right sat Donatello, to his right was Tony then Francesco the rest I did not know.  To my left would be the weakest of the Elders.  Donatello smiled, "You do not want Eldest?  You may pass the responsibility to your Vicar."

"And who is my Vicar?"  I had no idea what he was talking about.  To my knowledge no one every passed up the opportunity to be Eldest.

Francesco smiled, "Whomever you please, Eldest, but Eldest is your title and yours no matter your responsibility."

Donatello nodded.  "Your Vicar will be the pivot on which you place balance."

"I get to choose?  How can I do that I don't know most of you."

Donatello smiled, "You will know."

I opened myself to the magic of the room.  Maybe it would help.  I saw the lights dim and Donatello was lit with a halo of golden power.  I smiled and drew the door to the magic closed.  "If it pleases you, Donatello Giovanni, will be my Vicar?"

He nodded, "See I knew you'd know.  The conclave trusts the power of this room.  You are learning well Eldest."

I came to my chair and sat down.  The rest sat except for Donatello.  "As Vicar, my left, " He held his hand above my head, "And my right hands, "  He held his hand above Tony, are the balance of this Clan.  "The strongest and the weakest to provide balance to the clan."  He sat down.  "Our first order of business is brought to us by Aurora DeJesus."  

Aurora came through the door and set a heavy black book on the table.  "Your keeper should keep this safe."

Donatello asked, "What is it?"

I'd seen the book before.  I'd read it.  The book was passed from person to person at the table while they tried to figure it out.  Aurora looked at me with a smile.  The book came to rest before me.  Donatello looked at me, "What is it?"

I turned to him.  "It's the history of the world written by one of the First."

He looked at me as if I was speaking in tongues.  "The First are only legends."

I smiled, "You are legends to my kind.  Day walking vampires who live amongst humans as a human.  I only know what I read Vicar."

He nodded and took the book before him, "But there is nothing here."

I looked at  Aurora, she nodded.  I touched the book and and the words sprang from mist.  The room sat in stunned silence.  Aurora spoke softly, "She is a True Keeper of Secrets, and that is why I come.  While she slept we removed her protections and artifacts hid in our former compound.  There are things the other side cannot find."

I smiled, "We will go after we kill Valence."

Donatello looked me with a great smile.  "The Eldest has spoken.  I assume you have a plan."

Tony laughed, "It's not so much a plan as this is what she's going to do."

Tony filled the Elder circle in on the plan.  The hoping to places until we got to where Valence was said to be and kill him. 

The man sitting next to me, "And after that."

"We'll deal with that after we kill Valence.  I have a way into the compound no one but I can get out of.  Some of the most dangerous artifacts lie there, but it is dangerous and we will have to bar the entrance again once we are inside."  

The man smiled, "You have more of a plan then?"

"We have to kill the four remaining council after Valence.  They will be the most dangerous.  And then we will kill Brandon.  The logistics I've left to others."

A man came running into the room.  "Therians like I've never seen are on our border wanting to speak to the Vampire Queen.  We have no queen."

I sighed, "That is what the Fat Wolf King called me."
