# Nightmares Come to Life
_Saturday, July 18, 2015 8:00 PM_

The patterns around Dorian shifted with his emotions.  He stood staring at the door for too many moments to count before he turned and looked at me with concern.  "You okay?"

I still couldn't move I was paralized by the fear of my tormentor standing in front of me.  It had been 15 years since I'd seen the man and he still instilled a terror so complete that I couldn't even nod my head.

"Nox."  Dorian took a few steps towards me and my eyes followed him.  "He's gone.  It's alright."  Drake clung to my knees and Dorian looked down. "You need to snap out of it Nox.  Drake.."

He reached out for Drake and the little half dragon clung harder to my leg.  "Nox.  Breathe."

I let out a breath I hadn't realized I'd been holding most of the time Garrett had been in my apartment.  He knew where I lived now.  Fear lanced through my body and I sat down involuntarily on the floor.  Drake let go and as soon as I was done he was curling around me.  He sat in my lap his legs pulled as close to his own body as he buried his head against my neck and shoulder.  I managed to put my arms around him and hold him closer.  The mere act of feeling the boy in my arms helped.  I looked down at the boy and he purred in my arms.  This was right.  This was safe.

I looked up at Dorian and he gave me a weak smile.  "You alright?"

I managed to nodded.  "I'm better now."

Dorian stood up and grabbed my half finished beer and brought it to me.  "You might need this now."

I grinned at him as he sat down next to me.  I could feel the heat from his body next to me, his knee touching mine and I wanted more.  I wanted to envolope myself in his arms.  I wanted...

Dorian stood up and my heart started to sink.  He held a hand out to me and I looked up the length of him to his bright blue eyes. I hated feeling like the five year old child.  And I looked down.  

Dorian pulled Drake from my arms and the little boy sqwaked and sqirmed.  Dorian shhhed him.  "Shhh.  I'll give you back just a second Drake.  Nox needs help too.  Can you help me help him?"

The little boy looked at me with his orange eyes and nodded.  He squirmed down out of Dorian's arms and took my hands.  I slowly stood up.  My arms and my legs moved stiffly as if I'd run a marathon without stretching at all.  It hurt just to move.  Dorian took one of Drake's hands and Drake's other wrapped around two of my fingers tightly as Dorian lead us to the couch.

Dorian sat down and pulled Drakes blanket to him.  "Sit down Nox.  We'll take your mind off of things.  We can watch a movie.  Something funny."  I only nodded and sat down where Dorian told me.  He wrapped his arms around me as I laid back against him.  Drake climbed into both our laps and slipped quietly into my arms.  Dorain covered the little one with his blanket and I leaned my head against Dorian's shoulder.  It was very reminiscent of the night I'd spent at Dorian's except this time it was the other way around.  

Dorian flipped through the screens and found a comedy true to his word.  It was an old one, a stupid one. I supposed that was the point. 

I drifted in the comfort of Dorian and Drake.  After a while I could feel the heavy rise and fall of Drake's breathing and knew we should probably go to bed.  I sat up and shifted Drake in my arms.  I spoke softly, "I should get him to bed."

I could feel Dorian nodding.  He helped me sit up with the extra weight of Drake's sleeping form in my arms.  I carried the little man to my bed and tossed the blankets away and grinned at the persimmon colored sheets.  Dorian knew well my favorite color and I wondered how long it had taken to find the right shade of orange too.

Drake curled around the pillow and I covered him up.  I stood over him for a few moments just watching his chest rise and fall and was surprised at how quickly he'd wiggled his way into my heart.  Much the same way Jo and Lori had.  

I walked out to see Dorian cleaning things up.  "It's alright I'll take care of it in the morning.  I'll have to get used to child mess I think."

Dorian smiled.  "We both do I think."

I nodded and walked over to Dorian and stopped just in front of him.  "Thanks for being here."

Dorian nodded.  "I'm glad I was.  I can't imagine what he'd have done if someone wasn't here to witness.  I'm sorry."

I laughed softly, "What are you sorry about?  You aren't dating him."

Dorian grinned and took a step closer.  "I'm still sorry."  I bit my bottom lip and looked down and away from Dorian's blue eyes.  I wanted so much more.  I saw Dorian lift his hand and when he touched the side of my face and ran his fingers along my jaw I couldn't help the sound the escaped my lips.  I looked up and saw the look in his eyes.  A look I wanted to see for a while.  "You going to be okay?"  he asked.

I nodded.  "I think so.  Will you stop by before work?  I won't be off house arrest until after I see Margo later.  Drake needs to go to school."

Dorian nodded.  "Yeah.  I can.  I can stay if you need me too."

My heart skipped a beat at the thought of Dorian spending the night.  I wanted him to.  I did.  I swallowed and could feel the lump going down slowly.  I let out a breathless sigh.  "I don't think that would be a good idea."  

He grinned.  "Now who's slowing down?"

I laughed and leaned in and kissed Dorian softly.  I felt a shiver run down my spine.  All I could smell was the soft scent of cinamon and vanilla.  I tasted the wine lingering in Dorian's mouth and I sighed softly.  I pulled away just a little and looked into his eyes as I bit my bottom lip.  "Slowly."

Dorian nodded.  "Slow sounds good."

I licked my lips and Dorian pulled away farther.  "You keep doing that and it won't be slow anymore."

I grinned at him.  "I'm sorry.  You tasted too good."

Dorian smiled. "I'll see you in the morning."

I noded and followed Dorian to the front door.  He opened it part of the way and turned back to me.  "Nox."

"Yeah Dorian."  I took a deep breath waiting for the other shoe to drop.

"I had a good time."  He smiled.

"Me too."  I grinned at him.  "Oh.  Before you go.  Is the Dowager still bothering you?"

Dorian looked at me quizically, "Yeah the death of my mother stalled her for now. Why?"

I grinned.  "I have a thought.  I'll tell you about it later.  I need to get back to Drake."  I leaned in and kissed Dorian again and it was a little longer, and a lot wetter than before.   "Good night Dorian."

He smiled.  "Night Nox."  We stared for a few more moments before Dorian walked out the door.  I leaned against the door frame and watched him walk away.  His place wasn't that far away.  This could be interesting.

I shut the door when Dorian turned the corner to his apartment.  The apartment was too quiet.  I picked up Drake's bag and searched for the lights in the place.  I dimmed the living room so we weren't walking in the complete dark while we both learned our new surroundings.  

I still needed a shower though I really didn't want to wash off the lingering scent of Dorian.  But I still smelled of near nothingness.

I walked back to my bedroom and into the dark bathroom stubbing my toe on the door.  I would get used to the place eventually.  I shut the door and fumbled for the light.  I turned on the water and quickly washed.  I felt better.  I didn't need to linger, there was a three year old waiting me and I was actually a little tired.  Though I doubted I would sleep well - new place but more importantly I'd seen Garrett.  I could still see his smile and the brown eyes of my youth staring back at me.

I laid down on the other side of the bed and felt uncomfortable.  I hadn't ever slept on that side of the bed.  I moved closer to Drake and he rolled over and curled up with me, his head on my chest and a small arm drapped across my chest.  It felt comforting yet I knew I'd end up awake by midnight. 

I lay in bed taking in the soft scent of the little boy who was finding comfort in me and stared up at the ceiling waiting for my nightmares to engulf me.

I had been correct as sleep finally came my world disolved into the hidden depths of my mind.  Garrett no longer hide in the expanse of my mind.  No longer the red glowing eyes of the imaginary demon.  He stood taller in my dreams - I was five.  I was lost to the paralyzing fear as the first blow landed without warning.  

Images quaked and shivered and an image of Drake stood before me.  I tried to get to him but something barred my path.  The lashes resumed instead on Drake.  His little scream peirced my heart and I sat bolt upright from my sleep.  

The little dragon boy lie next to me curled in a ball and pressed against my body.  I could feel the sweat dripping from my brow, my shirt was soaked.  I lay back down and stared at the ceiling.  It was too early to get up.   I curled around the small form of the little half dragon in my bed and I wrapped my arms around him.  I knew sleeping would be bad, but my dreams soon took me in.

And again the dreams came.  Different this time.  Stella and Aidan danced happily through my dreamscape.   Garrett wrapped his arms around them and the darkness engulfed all three.  I heard nothing until there was a blood curdling scream.  I woke with my hands clenching the pillow Drake was curled around.

I pulled away from the little boy and lay on my back staring up at the ceiling.  My breath was ragged and I had to focus on each breathe to calm down.  I cycled through a relaxtion exercise one I'd used forever.  Five things I can see.  Four things I can touch.  Three things I could hear.  Two things I could smell and one thing I could taste.

The exercise exhausted my senses, I controlled my thoughts and my breathing.  Each count and object lowered my anxiety.  I was in control.  It was just a dream.  The world around me was mine.  I chose this life.  My fears and dreams did not control me.

I crawled out of bed and glanced at the time on my phone.  I still had hours before daw.  2am was not quite four but sleep wasn't going to play nice.  I padded bare foot to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee.  I was thankful my father and Dorian both knew what I liked.  My new apartment was well planned even though I hadn't done it.  It would prbably be lacking if I had.  

I started a yoga and body weight workout to finish the morning process.  I knew I wouldn't sleep another wink so this was the best I could do.
