# The Dinner I Feared
_Monday, July 20, 2015 6:00 PM_

I managed to write down a few things for Dorian on what an ideal testing situation would be in my eyes.  We sped up testing today just by showing them instead of making them figure it out.  Not everyone is attuned to what they see around them until they actually see it.  Everything about bending the elements is about seeing it.  

I didn't get to see Dorian again before I had to pick up Drake and go to Garrett's apartment a floor below mine.  That little fact made me smile just a little.  I had run to the store - literally ran - and picked up a bottle of red wine that looked like a brand Dorian had in his wine cooler.  I hoped it was.  I should have just asked him.

Drake and I showed up on Garrett's door step at precisely 6pm.  It was an exact time I'd received in a text shortly after picking up Drake.  I knocked and I could hear excited little footsteps running to answer the door.  I heard the privacy latch slide and knew Stella or Garrett had stepped towards the door at some point in time.  I promised myself I wouldn't freeze.  I steeled my nerve and I promised myself Garrett wouldn't bother me - he wouldn't scar me.

But I was wrong when Garrett held Aidan in his arm on his hip I froze.  He smiled his sweet slimey smile at me and I gave him a half grin.  I was trying.  I would not freeze.  I held up the bottle of wine.  "I only hope it goes with what you've made."

Aidan skimmed down Garrett and took Drake's and and the boys were off in an instant with Aidan in the lead.  Garrett took the bottle in his now free hand with a smile.  "Seems Dorian has taught you a thing or two."

I grinned ironically at him.  "I am a fast learner."

Garrett snickered and moved aside and let me into his small apartment.  I looked around and Garrett walked into the kitchen.  "In here, Nox."

I followed obediently.  I told myself I would have done it if anyone called me, not because he commanded.  He didn't command me.  

Garrett smiled at me again as he put the wine in a bucket of ice.  "Well done, my boy."  I choked back the bile that was going to rise in my throat.

"Thanks.  But I'm not some puppy."

Garrett nodded.  "Only showing you how proud I am of you.  How far you've come."

"Still I don't need to be patted on my back."  I chided him.  I looked around his kitchen.  It was well laid out and I felt at home in it.  "What's for dinner?  It smells good."

Garrett sounded proud as he spoke, "Roasted rosemary and garlic chicken."

I nodded.  "The wine should pair well then."  I had picked up a few things from my boyfriend.  The thought of calling Dorian my boyfriend made me smile.

Garret asked, "I've not seen that smile in many years."

I laughed.  "I wonder why."

Garrett took a step towards me and I immediately took a step back.  "Now, now, Nox.  Let's leave that in the past where it belongs."

I nodded.  "And have you done that to other children?"

Garrett laughed.  "As if I would tell you if I did.  Come help me prep the vegetables, I understand you are quite the cook."

"I enjoy it.  I don't think I'm better than anyone else, or chef worthy."

"You are always so hard on yourself."  Garrett noted as he placed a knife on the cutting board with several seasonal root vegetables.  I was thankful it wasn't all potatoes.  

I started cutting mechanically.  I tried to keep Garrett in my view at all times as he wandered his kitchen doing random prep and finishing touches.  But I got involved in the duty and I hardly noticed the man I feared walking behind me to fetch things.

He stopped and watched me inches behind me.  His hand touched my back and I froze.  "If you intend to leave the past behind us, please do not touch me."

Garrett removed his hand.  "Sorry."

It took me several moments before I continued what I was doing.  It took all my strength to ask, "You said you had something you wanted to talk to me about.  Now looks like a good time."

"Stella tells me you have differing views on the Venatori from what she's heard."  

I nodded.  "I suppose I do.  I haven't live a typical Venatori life.  I didn't have loving parents to show me the ropes to indoctrinate their lifestyle into me."

"You seem to beleive more like the CCB.  I've followed your record as a hunter and your kill rate is absimal.  Why is that?"

I shrugged.  "I don't kill them.  It's wrong to kill someone because they had some minor infraction of the law.  It's not fair to them or to their family to out and out kill them and destroy everyone else around them.  The supernatural creatures are people too in most cases anyway."

Garrett leaned on the counter next to me.  I looked up and saw his brown eyes sparkling with delight at me.  I wanted to spit in his face, instead I asked definantly, "What?"

Garrett grinned at me and wiped his hands on his apron.  He ran his finger down the side of my face.  "I used to be able to comfort you easily."

I let him touch me.  "I don't need your comfort.  I'm a grown man."

Garrett laughed.  "That's not what your dreams tell me."

I pulled away from him.  "My what?"

Garrett smiled.  "You dream about me every night.  Don't you?  I get better billing than your beloved Dorian."  I stared back at him and he laughed.  "You didn't know, how sweet."  He leaned in and whispered, "You were always such an easy child to manipulate."

I set the knife down on the cutting board and took two steps away from Garrett before backing into something.  I turned around to feel a small pair of hands at the small of my back.  I looked down and saw a pretty little red head staring back at me.  She smiled.  "Everything alright in here?"

I nodded.  "Perfectly fine.  Garrett was just telling me why I was here."

Stella stepped around me and wrapped her arms around her boyfriend.  I wanted to hurl.  Well that's a lie I wanted to run away as fast as I could and take her, Aidan and Drake with me, but I stood watching as Garrett leaned down and kissed Stella.  She turned back to me.  "He wants you to help him turn the Venatori into what they were always meant to be."

I cocked my head, "And what is that?"

Garrett shook his head.  "We can discuss that later.  Dinner is ready.  Stella why don't you find the boys and get their hand washed while Nox and I finish up here."

Stella was off looking for the boys who were giggling off in another room.  I wasn't sure what was going on.  Garrett's claim he knew about my dreams scared me.  Was he manipulating me all these years?  I blinked away the terror I knew had to be running across my face.  Garrett smiled arrogantly at me.

Garrett took two step towards me and I took one back keeping my distance before I noticed the look on his face and the patterns of air behind him.  I froze in place out of habit.  His smile returned.  "You haven't completely lost all reason."

I sighed. "What do you want Garrett?"

Garrett laughed.  "Nothing more than your loyalty.  That's all right now.  Be good and your friends will be fine.  I would hate to have to return my favors upon the tender flesh of your lover."

Anger rose up.  It was the first time he overtly threatened my family.  He threatened Dorian and I took a step forward and he laughed at me.  "A back bone.  Who would have thought the little brat that set me on fire innocently had a backbone to back it up?"

Stella peered through the closed bar shutters.  "You two finish up the boys are restless."

Garrett turned to her with a smile.  "We are setting the table right now."

He turned to me and I smiled at him which probably looked more like a snarl.  I picked up the platters in front of me and walked out into the dinning area and set them in the middle then took a seat which I hoped was far enough away from Garrett.

Drake sat down next me and Aidan next to him.  It put Garrett or Stella too close too me.  I sighed as I waited for the others to join us.  Garret poured three glasses of wine and brought to plastic cups of what looked like grape juice in them and set them down by the boys.  He lifted his glass.  "To life long friends."

I mimic the gesture and nodded my head.  I would not speak the words.  I would not let Garrett make me say them.  He only chuckled at my non-response as Stella chimed in after him.

How could she be so oblivious to him?  It boggled my mind.  Thankfully the topics of conversation revovled around the boys and what they were doing in school, what they liked and things like that.

By the time desert arrived on the table everyone was seemingly having a wonderful time.  I could act like it but I was cautious and lerry of my hosts motives.  I would play nice to keep my friends and family safe from him.  I would play his game for now.  I would figure a way out of this.

We hadn't discussed anything major while we had desert either.  The boys were far more interested in playing than enjoying anything Garrett had to offer and were excused to go play.  

Stella smiled over her bowl of lemon gelato at Garrett and I had to fight the urge to roll my eyes.  I really didn't see what she saw in him.  But then she didn't know what he'd done to me.  And really I had no intentions of enlightening her either.  I didn't need more pity from people.

Garrett smiled back at his doe-eyed girlfriend then turned to me.  "Come, Nox, let's go for a walk."

I shrugged and looked at Stella and she grinned as she started to clean up the mess of dinner.  I suppose they beleived in sharing the chores.  I prefered to do my own clean up - call me anal.  I stood up and followed Garrett out his front door into the hall way.  I expected a drastic change in demeanor the moment the door was closed, but what I didn't expect was for him to be nice.  "The boys get along so well."

I nodded.  "Same age.  Same basic situation.  Both coming from broken homes."

Garrett nodded.  "And you don't want to see them raised like you?"

I stopped and stared at the man who'd once mentored me.  "What do you know of how I was raised?"

Garrett's smile grew dark.  "Do you honestly think I left the one bright spot in my career to his own means?"

"I owe you nothing."  I almost spat the words out and Garrett laughed at me.

"I am the reason you do what you do.  I am the reason you are who you are.  Without me your so-called issues would not have created the man that you are.  I am proud of you, almost like my own son."

Garrett stepped closer and I froze.  "Nox.  I want you to do something for me.  And failure to do so, will not only result in harm to yourself, but to one of the few you care greatly for.  Do you understand me?"  Garrett didn't give me a chance to tell him no before there were fine tentaclas of air snaking down my hoodie.  I could feel the razor sharp edges snagging on the fabric and scratching my back.  

I took a deep breathe and nodded.  "What do you want me to do?"

Garrett smiled.  "Good lad.  I want you to get me a very specific set of details.  The itinerary of Mark Green and the delegates coming in from Europa.  It shouldn't take someone of your skills long to get that.  Due in two days time.  After that you'll see consequences.  And I have a little surprise for you tonight."

I only nodded and Garrett wrapped his arm around my shoulders and led me back to his door.  "Let's get Drake and send you off on your way home."

I hated this.  I hated being manipulated.  But at the moment there was nothing I could do.  Garrett opened the door to his apartment and called out.  "Drake, you ready to go home little man?"

Drake frowned and started to cry until he saw the look Garrett gave him.  I held out my arms and Drake almost ran to them and climbed up my long body to get away from Garrett.  I held out my hand to the demon in front of me.  "Thank you for dinner.  We should do it again sometime."  I could taste the bitterness in my words.

Garrett laughed.  "Your place next time."

Fuck! I nodded.  "Later Stella."

Stella picked up Aidan and carried him to us.  I smiled at Aidan.  "I will see you tomorrow."

Aidan grinned and waved.  "Night ya'll," I said as I turned and left.  I wanted out of there.  Drake clung to my neck as we walked to the eleveator.  I wanted away from Garrett far faster than my near jelly like legs could carry me.
