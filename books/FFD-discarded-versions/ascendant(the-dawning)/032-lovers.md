# Lovers
_Monday, July 20, 2015 8:40 PM_

I heard voices in the other room, they were talking softly and I couldn't tell if they were angry or happy or whatever, and then there was silence.  I didn't want to be caught eavesdropping so I stepped out of the hall and saw Dorian with another man, kissing.  My heart sank.  Fuck was right.

Dorian pulled away first and looked past his friend at me with a sad look.  The other man turned around.  "Ah.  You had company.  How very unlike you Dorian."  He walked to me with a swager I wanted to punch.  He knew Dorian was watching the pair of us and he was flaunting his good looks and their history.  "Todd Ingram.  You are?"

I took his hand.  "Nox."

"Nox?  No last name?"  He sounded offended.

I added at his insistance.  "SÃ©tanta."

Todd looked back at Dorian and then back at me.  "This is the boy you were so caught up in discovering his true ability."  He snickered. "Are you exploring other avenues now, Dorian?  Taking advantage of that trust."

I glared at the man.  "Fuck you.  Dorian has done no such fucking thing."

Todd laughed.  I wasn't sure if he was laughing at me or not.  I was ready to punch him.  Dorian stepped between us.  His hand resting gently on my chest as I tried to catch my breathe.  I looked down at his hand on my chest.  I looked at the man across from me who was still laughing.  

"He's a fiesty one."  Todd said with glee.

I noticed Dorian was doing his best not to touch the other man, yet his hand was on my chest.  A small rush of hope cooled my anger.

Dorian continued to stare down Todd with his hand on my chest as he stood between us.  "Nox.  This is Todd, my lover."

Todd laughed again.  "That's a first.  I don't think he's ever introduced me to anyone as anything but his friend."

Dorian's stare turned into a glare and Todd clamped his mouth shut with a mouthed sorry.

Dorian continued.  "Todd is the only man, other than you who has seen the otherside of that door."

I pushed Dorian's hand from my chest.  "So you lied to me then.  You have brought others home."

Dorian turned to look at me and shook his head.  "No.  I didn't lie.  I didn't bring Todd home, he lives here."

"What the fuck, Dorian?  When were you going to tell me I was just a play thing."  I was furious.  "Nevermind Dorian.  I'll see you at work."  

I turned to and started for the door but Dorian caught my arm and pushed me up against the wall angrily.  He looked sad.  "It's not what you think."

I glared at Dorian.  "Get. the. fuck. off. me."

Dorian pushed me harder against the wall and then let me go.  I glared at him as I straighted my shirt.  "So tell me then what the fuck it is, if it's not you two are in a committed fucking relationship and I'm just some side line freak show for you two to laugh at."

Todd stepped over to us.  "He's right.  It's not what you think.  Sit down and we can explain."

I glared at them I wasn't sitting anywhere with either of them.  Todd turned, "Have it your way.  Wine Dorian?"

Dorian nodded, "Yes.  There is a beer in the fridge for Nox."

Todd smiled but didn't say a word as he pulled out the beer and popped the top before he set it on the counter at an empty seat.  Dorian sat down in the middle chair at the bar and started speaking.  "Todd is my best friend.  Much like you and Jason.  The counter lever to my image of perfection. My best friend is not at all the person I am.  He got me in trouble just like your father got mine in trouble, and Jason got you in trouble.  Tood is the reason for the tattoo.  A dare of sorts.  He chickened out after the first session, but I saw it through."

Dorian took a sip of the wine and Todd continued.  "I'm never here.  I'm always away on business.  I didn't feel it necessary to have my own living quarters here, so Dorian offered his residence to me at anytime.  He's never had anyone over so I didn't think to call ahead.  His love affairs never take place at home.  Neither do mine.  To find you here is both wonderful and shocking."

"Wonderful?"  I asked.

Todd smiled.  "Yes.  Dorian has finally found someone he can trust.  And I appolgoize for my comments before.  If I'd known you'd take offense as Dorian does, I wouldn't have said anything."

I interrupted.  "I am not offended at the words.  It's a sticking point for Dorian to be with me because of our past relationship and you just fucking reminded him of it.  After interrupting where we were going."

Dorian looked over at me, "Come sit, please, Nox."

I sighed and sat down next to Dorian and pushed the beer away.  "I don't need a drink."

Todd grinned, "It'll help heal the wounds."

I shook my head.  "No it won't.   It'll fuck me up more than I already am."

Dorian stood up and put the beer in the sink and poured me a glass of water.  "Nox is particular about certain things."

Todd laughed, "Of course he is.  He'd have to be to put up with you."

I grinned.  "He has a lot more to put up with than I do.  Trust me."

Dorian shook his head.  "Todd lives here.  We have had sex in the past, Nox.  We've not been together in over a year."

Todd added, "Mostly because I haven't been here.  But I have a man I'm seeing in London exclusively.  I'm in town on business.  Dr. Eriksen has called upon my expertise."

I raised an eyebrow.  "What's your expertise?"

Todd laughed.  "Easily distracted I see.  Nothing you'd be interested in I'm sure.  Genetics is my specialty."

I nodded. "Gentics in school was easy.  I know it's nothing like school but it's all patterns."

Dorian grinned.  "Why don't you show Nox something you are working on?"

Todd looked at me and nodded.  "If you think he won't be bored to tears.  You never found my work interesting, Dorian."


Dorian smiled.  "No.  But it wasn't my calling either."

Todd laughed. "That is true.  Even your photographic memory barely got you through your genetics course."

Dorian yawned in response.  "It always makes me so tired."

Todd laid a paper down in front of me with four separate charts.  I had no idea what I was looking at.  I could see patterns jumping out at me; they of course meant nothing to me.  I asked.  "Can I write on it?"

Todd looked at me with a questioning look on his face and nodded.  He handed me a pen.  "Sure.  I guess.  It's just a copy of a peice of the report I'll hand Asher Eriksen tomorrow."

I circled the patterns that repeated from the bottom three in the top three.  "I have no idea what it means, but this is the same as here, and this one here and this one here."  I pointed at the patterns that matched and when I looked up Todd was staring at me.  I'd seen the look before, when someone was confouned by my ability to pick out patterns.  

Tood shook his head.  "Damn you did that fast."

I shrugged.  "It's my gift."

Todd laughed.  "That's one hell of a gift and you chose Venatori over a life of study?"

With a guffaw I spoke.  "Hah.  Me study.  Yeah no, that would never work."

Dorian laughed.  "This is the kid who delibrately failed his senior finals with the exact grade needed so he wouldn't be first or second in his class."

Todd nodded.  "I remember the story.  I've heard a great deal about the boy who Dorian made his life's study."

I frowned.  Dorian stood up and wrapped his arms around me and buried his face in the crook between my neck and shoulder and whispered, "It's okay, Nox.  I am not bothered by our past.  And Todd wouldn't care either way.  I'm sorry he interrupted... things."

I turned to Dorian and he kissed me deeply.  Todd laughed softly.  "I will take the couch tonight."

Dorian took my hand and pulled me towards the the bedroom.  "Todd, warning.  Nox is up early."

Todd asked.  "How early is early?"

I snickered, "I'll try not to wake you up."  I wasn't exactly in the mood for what was about to happen before.  And in all honesty I wasn't sure I wanted to stay, but Dorian held my hand and guided me with ease back into the blue bedroom that reminded me so much of his eyes and closed the door with a simple click and turned the latch locking us in - alone.

Dorian dropped my hand and walked to what I imagined was his side of the bed.  He looked at me with concern.  "I'm surprised you came.  I can see the anger pulsing through the fire around you.  If it were anyone else I would worry about the room catching fire."

I asked, "I assume Todd can't see it."

Dorian shook his head.  "No, he is not Magnus not even slightly."

I only nodded.  I was starting to see new patterns around everyone, things that I'd always been seeing but couldn't interpret before.  It all seemed so very clear to me now.  Todd could learn if he wanted to, but I didn't say anything to Dorian.  I wondered if that meant this was doomed to fail before it ever started.

Dorian looked at me, I could see the fear dancing in his eyes.  Before he could ask me I pulled my shirt over my head and walked to the other side of the bed before tossing it in the chair next to it.  Dorian was watching me with caution.  "Why did you stay Nox?  You are brimming with rage.  I'm sorry to have not told you.  I didn't ever expect it to become a problem before I told you of my roommate situation.  Todd has not been home in over a year."

I shrugged.  "I had looked forward to a dreamless sleep after seeing Garrett tonight.  I think that's why I stay.  I'm mad Dorian.  I'm pissed you lied even if you don't see it as such.  You did bring him home.  You've slept with him in this room.  I don't know why I'm angry Dorian.  I don't expect people to be truthful in their experiences." I sighed.   "I just want to sleep now, if that's alright with you?"

Dorian nodded and finished removing his shirt and undershirt before working the belt and his dress pants.  Everything was neatly folded and placed in the chair next to him.  He stood in a pair of blue boxers that matched the sheets below the white comforter.  I hadn't realized I was staring as Dorian crawled into bed. 

I finished getting undressed and slipped into the side Dorian wasn't on.  I lay on my side facing away from Dorian.  I wanted to cry.  Fuck!  I had fucking fallen in love with a man who was living with someone else.  I tried to close my eyes but everytime I did I could see Garrett laughing at me.  It wasn't my dreams coming to haunt me, I didn't think, it was the waking world playing back in my minds eye.

I listened to the rythym of Dorian's breathing and it never drifted into the stead state that said he was sleeping.  I rolled over on to my back and stared up at the ceiling.  Then I glanced over at Dorian.  The dim light of his alarm clock illuminated the room and I could see Dorian's lovely eye lashes blinking in thought.  I rolled over to face Dorian.  My hands at my chest and myself buried under the blankets as I watched him.  He knew I was watching him.  He tried very hard not to look at me, and not to smile.  I broke the silence first.  "What's on your mind?"

Dorian shook his head.  "Nothing.  Well not nothing, nothing more than what happened tonight.  I screwed up.  Nox."  With a heavy sigh Dorian continued as he stared up at the ceiling. "In the beginning you weren't supposed to be anything more than a passing exploit.  The one night stand that got me through a painful night."

My heart sank as Dorian told me how he'd felt that first dinner we'd had.  I was nothing more than a toy.  But Dorian continued and I tried to focus on his words and not my own feelings but I could feel the hot sting of tears rolling down my cheeks.  "But you became so much more.  I hadn't intended to have a break down in front of you.  I rather expected you to take full advantage of having me that close to your body.  To be everything everyone expected of you.  I waited for that moment.  For the moment to drown in lust, in the fire of unfetted sex.  But that moment never came.  Instead, the supposed callous boy comforted me.  Warm arms around me, a soft comforting hum in my ear and then an eventual surrender into your dreams.  I watched another entire movie lying in your arms while you slept.  You tell me I make you feel safe.  But in that moment it was so much more for me.  You weren't just that kid anymore.  And then the world crashed around us.  Levi hunting me like game and nearly ending my father's life, my own and your father's."

Dorian turned to look at me rolling over on his side as he continued.  "Your touch when I was nearly gone awoke more than just my life, Nox.  I feel as though my life is tied to yours in so many ways.  I'm drawn to your fire.  To your charisma.  I don't know how to explain it.  After I found out you'd jumped from the building to catch Levi and nearly died I vowed then and there I wouldn't let fear guide me.  I was afraid to get close to you.  To know you.  And I came by every day to sit with you.  And when I realized you slept better with me around, I came by more often."  

He put his hand flat on the bed between us. I stared at it as he contiued, studying the countour of his hand - the shape of his nails.  "And then when you woke up, you dropped a bomb on me.  Told me you'd fallen in love.  I already knew then how I had wanted things to go.  Planned it, knew exactly what to say and your admission threw it all out the window.  My fear ratcheted up and I left.  I knew one of two things would happen after that.  You would hate me for the rest of your life because I rejected you, or you'd pretend it never happened - blame it on the meds making you loopy.  Whatever excuse I knew it was ultimately the same idea as the first, you were angry at the world for taking away things you need."

I added, "And then Margo interferred."

Dorian gave me a half smile and nodded.  "And then Margo interferred and I saw you with my son.  How easy it was for you to step into a fatherly role with him and with Drake and I knew in that moment I couldn't run from it.  I had to let you know somehow that I wasn't afraid anymore.  And now, I've screwed it up."

I shook my head.  "No.  Not screwed it up."  I took Dorian's hand and did more than just scoot closer.  I wrapped my body around his.  Dorian instictively laid on his back and I draped my arm and leg over him and he wrapped his arm around me as I put my head on his shoulder.  I felt more at peace in that one moment than I had my entire life, and it was still on the edge of a lie.  "We'll get through it Dorian.  We all make mistakes and I know I'll make far more than you ever will."

I kissed the soft flesh beneath my head.  "Sleep now, Dorian.  We can deal with everything in the morning."

Dorian idly rubbed my back with the tips of his fingers.  He'd run over scars and I was reminded of what Garrett had done only a short while ago.  I didn't think there were any marks at least not anything Dorian could distinquish from the existing scars.  I could feel him winching underneat me at the sevarity of the damage on my back.  For all the gesture would normally send me over the moon it was relaxing having Dorian comforting me.

I closed my eyes and took in the soft scent that was Dorian.  The cinamon and the vanilla washed away my fears and my sleep was dreamless.
