# The Dawning

I was half way to my office when my sister stopped me in the hall way.  "Asher, we have a problem."

Of course we did.  There was always some sort of problem to deal with, but whatever she thought was a problem was likely not.  I stopped and gave her my steady ice blue gaze.  She frowned, I knew she wasn't happen but she continued on as if unphased by my icy glare.  "The boy, the one who should have died..."  

Yes, the boy who should have died.  Jumping from the building like he'd done so many times before.  I had an easy view of his exploits as he threw himself from the building from such a young age.  Now it seemed he'd gotten wreckless and nearly killed himself.  And from what Amara told me he should have been dead.  Almost every bone in his body had broken.  He had suffered damage to his internal organs.  It was like his body had miracuously healed itself.  And it had been an exceedingly long time since that had happened.  I had been most intriqued, but now there was a problem and I seemed to have missed it from the look on my sister's face.

"You never listen to me, Asher."  She scoulded me like I was some child of hers.  If she only knew the half of it it would send her mind into oblivion.

"I will listen this time - repeat the problem again, dear sister.  You know my mind wanders."

She rolled her eyes and started.  "The boy who almost died he is healing faster than you'd like and I'm not even close to finishing my observations of him."

"You are his doctor.  Do not let him go."  It was as simple as that don't let him go.  

She sighed, "He isn't just some no body, Asher.  He knows too many people - his father is already trying to get him released.  And not to mention the Vegas and the Riveras.  Asher, I have no reason to keep him.  He's up and walking around.  He's essentially healed."

I mimicked her sigh, "Then find some other reason to keep him in the hospital.  He did afterall throw himself off of a building.  I'm sure you can think of something."  I started walking away.  "You are more than capable of figuring this out on your own Amara.  I know you can think of the solution."  I had given her enough of a hint, and she was smart woman.

There was no daylight only the dim lights of the hospital room that I had been calling home for over a month.  I longed to feel it's warmth but that wasn't likely to happen anytime soon.  My doctor wanted me to stay in the hospital longer, I was getting antsy.  I'd only been awake a few days but I wanted out.  This staying in bed thing was never something I was good at.  I blamed Dae'lin for that - always on time - always on schedule that was her philosphy and it had become mine.

My bright green eyed doctor came in all bushy-tailed with a scraggly man following at her heals.  I smirked I knew the man.  I'd seen him regularly over the course of my years here in New York City.  He was a shrink - not my shrink mind you, but he was one.  Dr. Eriksen must be looking for any and every excuse to keep me in the hospital - including my mental stability.  I knew no matter what I said I was going to end up with a stint in some holding cell while my tendancy to jump from buildings was taken into account.  My therapist knew the exact reason I jumped.  She beleived me when I said I hadn't tried to kill myself when I went after Levi.  But that's what you get when the people asking the questions don't know you.

I flashed Dr. Eriksen my best smile and she rolled her eyes.  It was the same reaction she'd been giving me since I woke up - well after that first day anyway.  She was pretending to be immune to my charms.  I was okay with that.  She nodded to the man behind her.  "Nox, this is Dr. Wilton.  He's a phsyciatrist here and I'd like him to talk to you for a little while.  If that's alright with you."

I looked at the scraggly man with his coke bottle eye glasses and his balding hair and sighed, "I don't really have much choice now do I?"

Dr. Wilton answered the question for Dr. Eriksen.  "No son, you don't.  If I clear you, you are free to go home today."

"And if you don't?"  I asked, but I already knew the answer.

He answered calmnly, like he was used to saying these things.  "Then we will place you under Pcsych evaluation and you'll be moved to the Pscyc ward until we do clear you."

I looked over at Dr. Eriksen who was frowning.  I knew I didn't have a prayer of actually leaving today.  This was a mere formality and a distraction while they drew up my extended stay in the psych ward.  I was not looking forward to this interview.

Dr. Eriksen started regailing me with the reasons, "Nox.  We know you've a history of throwing yourself from this very building.  It is a dangerous sport, we are only concerned for your safety."

I laughed, "I'm almost 22 and no one has cared for my safety for more than 13 years, why start now."  I rolled my eyes.  "If you please, let's get on with this."  I was tired of being nice - pretending like it didn't matter.  It did matter.  I wanted the fuck out of this bed and out of this room.  I wanted to see the sun and get on with my life - preferrably away from here.

But that was a lie.  I knew it.  It's what I told myself was best after throwing a tray table across the room because I'd spilled my heart to someone and he walked out.  Rejection stung and it was the largest reason I pushed everyone away from me.  That was my therapy talking.  I was not unstable no matter what they said.

Dr. Wilton nodded and Dr. Eriksen walked out, closing the door behind her as she left.  The man nodded to the chair to my left and a grayed lock of hair feel over his round specticales, "Mind if I sit."

"Whatever you want.  You can stand for all I care."  My mood was getting more than sour the longer I had to endure this charade.

The good doctor frowned but he sat down and fumbled with his brief case.  He pulled out a yellow legal pad once it was finally snapped open on his lap.  The pen was your standard issue Bic pen - nothing fancy for this man.  How plain.  His choice of functional items was as boring as his appearance.

Dr. Wilton adjsuted in his chair and then looked up at me.  "Mr. SÃ©tanta, can you tell me how you are feeling today?"

"It's Nox.  And I can."  I grinned playfully at the doctor - if he was going to be plain and ordinary I was going to be annoying and obnoxious.  

The doctor looked like he'd eaten a sour grape and I my grin widened.  I was going to make him speak correctly.  It was an annoyance that made most people want to kill me.  I was tired of being holed up here, so this poor man was getting the brunt of my distaste.  He blew through his graying mustache.  "Tell me how you are feeling today."

Now he was getting commanding and that was no better for him.  If anyone knew anything about it me it was that one thing I didn't do well with authoritative figures.  Unless of course they were a certain short brunette who would have flayed me alive - for real if I pissed her off.  There were two people I listened to without question - make that three.  And they were the only three adults in my life that had given me even a side ways glance.  And all three had been assigned to me.  They had no choice.

Such was my life.  I sighed, "Do you want my physical condition, mental or both?"  He was going to have to learn to be specific.  I enjoyed talking about myself without some rules I could go on forever.  I gave him a half-hearted smile saying I was trying to be civil now.  But he was pushing my limits.

"Both will do.  Please."  Dr Wilton seemed to add the latter as if he were trying to be civil as well.  Perhaps he'd been toying with me too.  You could never tell with those straight laced shrinks like him.  I was so thankful Margo was my therapist!

Nox nodded with a sigh.  "Physically I'm sore and starving.  And probably a little bit horny."  Nox grinned as the doctor winced at his physical condition.  "Mentally I'm just tired of all this crap.  I want to go home."

The doc nodded as he jotted down a few things on his yellow note pad. Blue ink, how had I missed that before?  Not that it mattered but it made the contract of ink on paper that much harder to read from this distance.  Not that Dr. Wilton was even letting me get a glance at the paper.

"All this crap you refer to, ca... explain what you mean."  The doctor studder clearly showed he was watching what he said around me now.  

I grinned at him, "The tests, the talking, lying here in bed with absolutely nothing to do.  How do you like just sitting around doing nothing?"

He looked up from his peice of paper and frowned at me.  "I'm the one asking the questions."

I rolled my eyes.  One of those doctors.  I sighed, "Fine."

"Have you ever jumped from the building before?"  He asked as if he hadn't know the answer.  Surely that was in my records.  What did this man know?  Apparently nothing.

"Yes.  I've not jumped from this building in about three years.  But I used to do it on a regular basis."  

"Why haven't you jumped in thre years?"

I laughed.  "Because I've not been here."  Duh!

He jotted down yet more notes.  "And have you hurt yourself in the prior jumps?"

"Yeah once or twice."  I had been just learning how to do it.  I broke my leg once and an arm the second time.  But I hadn't been trying to hurt myself.

"Did you hurt yourself on purpose?"  He asked with great concern in his voice.

"I've never done anything with the express purpose of hurting myself."  I was insulted by that line of thought.  I was really being interrogated because Dr. Eriksen thought I was a danger to myself?  Really?  How far from wrong could the doctor be.

"Yet you threw yourself from a building at break neck speed.  Why?"

Really he didn't know?  I sighed.  "I was chasing a bad guy."

"And do you normally put yourself in mortal danger because of a "bad guy"?"  I was getting tired of the emotion in his voice.  He was sounding very judgmenetal for a man of the pschological intrique.

"I do whatever is necessary to catch the bad guy."  I wanted to get up and walk away but that was likely not going to do anything better for the outcome.  I alrady knew I was staying but I didn't need to make it worse.

He started to ask another question but I interrupted him.  "Look I get it.  You want to keep me here for my own safety.  Let's not pretend anymore.  The doc wants me to stay.  You are designing questions so that I look like I'm a danger to myself so I can be placed on suicide watch.  Fine.  All well and good, Dr. Wilton.  I'll play the game.  I'll stay here longer just to suit all the idiots who want to watch me in that little glass ball we call the psych ward.  But I'm not going to sit here and let you ask me questions, write down whatever notes you are that say I'm a danger to myself.  "

I took a deep breath of air, talking that much was hurting my still healing chest.  But I continued through the pain. "I have never, or will never hurt myself.  I'm too self centered and egotistical to risk my own neck on my own stupid behavior.  If I can make it through my childhood with out slitting my wrists or blowing my brains out I'm fairly certain my adult life is not going to go to hell in a hand basket just because I'm depressed and anxious."

"Yes, I take risks - calculated risks.  Unlike you idiots seem to think, I didn't throw myself over the edge of the building because I was taking an uncessary risk - hoping to die.  I was going after a kid who I taught how to jump over the edge.  A kid if he got away could slip around the city and be gone from our lives and never have justice served.  He was by all Venatori standards marked for death.  But if he survived that jump because of me it would eat me up inside.  A man I look up to was injured, no three men I looked up to were injured.  Two of those med lost someone close to them, and my father almost lost a son - a son he knew about and cared for.  There were people lost in this situation and I would hunt this kid down until the day I died because of it.  So get of your damned high horse - no other hunter is put under such scrutiny.  They kill without remorse.  They take risks for the greater good.  Get off my back!"

Dr. Wilton had put his pen down and was listening rather intently to my rant.  He hadn't even made a singular note the entire time.  I was impressed, as I wasn't sure he had it in him to actually look at me.  He assessed me with this plain brown eyes.  There really was nothing remarkable about this man.  "You are very astute for one such as you.  Dr. Silverman has been working with you for how long?"

"Since I was six.  What does that matter?"  Margo had nothing to do with this.

"It doesn't matter.  You just seem to understand a great deal about your own mental well-being."

I was dumbfounded by the words.  "Of course I do.  I'm told I like to understand things.  And that includes myself every niche and cranny that hides inside.  Patterns and puzzles, and I am my greatest mystery to solve."

He grinned at my comment.  "Very arragonat of you."

I smiled, "I am nothing if not consistant."

The man stood up, "I will dispense with the pretenses then.  Dr. Eriksen wanted a third opinion on your mental health.  While you claim to be stable, I note you are not on any medications, more have you actually seen your therapist more than once in three years.  It is my recomendation that you be kept under watch for the next week to assess your mental health before we release a dangerous adversary into the world again."

They thought I was dangerous?  More dangerous than what?  I sighed and nodded.  I wasn't going anywhere for at least a week.  What the fuck was I going to do for a week!
