# Changing Dreamscape
_Wednesday, July 15, 2015 11:30 PM_

I was surprised when I opened my laptop to find it was already rather late and no one had bothered to check on me or tell me to go to sleep.   I closed the lid on the laptop and doused the light I'd created.  The eirey green glow left me uncomfortable as I pulled my jeans, shoes and socks off before crawling into my cot.  

The pillow still lay across way on the floor and I left it there pulling the blankets to the middle of my chest and putting my hands behind my head.  I could feel the pull of sleep drawing my eyes closed.  I was tired.  I hadn't eaten and now my body was running on empty.  I thought I could almost feel the healing process in my bones.

The darkness came as it always did.  The world slipped around me as my emptiness unfolded into a dark room.  The light never changed, but I knew there was things around me.  I could hear sounds - fell currents of air moving.  I knew I wasn't alone.  

_later that night_

It was always the same when the dreams came.  Slowly through the darkness slithered tenticals of air.  I could feel their ragged caress on my skin as I fought the urge to scream.  Everything felt different - larger than life as the tenticles ripped my shirt from my skin.  The voice spoke to me, "You are an abomination."  

I felt the first lash rip through the skin along my back.  I could feel the blood oozing from the wound even as my body healed itself.  The blows came again and again.  Air then Earth.

A strange orange glow engulfed the room as tenticles of fire formed in front o me.  My heart quickened.  I felt the terror rise inside me.  The first lash landed as the creature with red eyes growled at me, "I am coming for you."  I felt the lash burn and sear my skin as I woke up sitting bolt upright.  My hair was slicked with sweat, my pulse beating rapidly through my veins.  The blankets were all around my ankels from the struggle in my sleep.  I could feel the phantom pains running the length of my back.  

I reached behind me.  I knew I'd find nothing but sweat and t-shirt but I still felt my back, my shirt was completely intact - not ripped from my body, or slashed to pieces.  I didn't expect anything less despite the feelings coursing through my body.

I took a deep breath and got up out of bed.  I wondered how long I'd slept.  I missed some sort of clock - anything to tell me what time it was.  I crawled out of bed and focused on my breathing.  I had to calm down.  Instead of my usual technique I chose a form of yoga mediation as I curled myself up on the floor into position.  

I thought about nothing other than the air coming in and then slowly going out.  It was the center of my world.  Nothing else could dip into my existance in that moment except for the buzzing of my cell phone dictating it was 4am.  I grinned as I unfurled from my meditative position and crawled to my bag in the closet and dug around in the bag for my cell phone.  A note was attached to it.  "Service is blocked in this wing.  But I know how you are. - Margo."

I smiled and kissed the little slip of paper and ingrained the thanks in my mind.  Margo was a goddess.

I felt better.  It was an addition of sorts, but time was not relative to me.  Everything scheduled, everything in order.  With my phone by my side I was feeling better, even as I recollected the dream I had just woken from.  

Before I could forget I started looking for my nightmare journal and found it had slid across the floor under the table when I'd thrown the pillow across the room.  I picked it up and dusted off the pages that had been flayed open on the floor.  Sadly enough it was opened to a night of no dreams - the night I'd spent sleeping on a couch in a strange place with a man who I had fallen for in the other room.  My mood sank as I turned several pages past the empty one - past those days nightmares and left room to sketch the nightmares and dreams I could remember while I'd been in a coma.  

I started drawing in a number 2 pencil - it was all I used except for the occassional red for emphasis.  But with colored pencils in arms reach I pulled across the oranges and the reds and yellows of the eirie tentacles.  The dream had changed - but why?
