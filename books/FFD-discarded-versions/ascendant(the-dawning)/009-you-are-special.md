# You are Special
_Thrusday, July 16, 2015 4:00 PM_

I hadn't realized the time as Leroy looked at his watch when someone knocked on the door.  He got up and opened it and Dr. Eriksen was on the other side.  She frowned the moment she saw him.  He looked back at me with a grim smile, "He's all your's, Dr. Eriksen I hope you have better luck talking to him than I did.  He's in a foul mood."

I rolled my eyes and stayed in my seat as Leroy left.  

Dr. Eriksen watched the man walk down the hallway before she shut the door and sat down in the chair opposite me.  I had to look down, the patterns around her were chaotic and bright.  I wondered what she was feeling to send her chaos sprialing outward like that.  "Are you giving Dr. Wilton a hard time, Nox?"

I shrugged.  I wasn't exactly in a sharing mood right then.  I didn't look up at her either.  So she continued, "Everyone here says you've been behaving but Dr. Wilton didn't look like you had been.  What's wrong?"

I rolled my eyes.  "He continues to call me by a name I do not like."  I looked up at her and had to blink as she was still bright and chaotic.  "And he's instant that I'm a danger to myself despite what my therapist of fifteen years says.  Of course it's on your orders so whatever."

I got up and started pacing.  I knew something was wrong but no one since Margo left was actually going to help or even notice the fact that I was acting strange.  "I told you I would allow you to study me, and yet you insist I be here under suicide watch."  I turned abruptly towards here.  "I will not hurt myself.  I don't mind being here.  I don't mind living on this schedule.  I mind the fact that you think I'd hurt myself or someone around me.  I've never given anyone that impression ever - even when I start a fight I've never actually tried to do more than get them off my back."

I turned back to my pacing, I really didn't want to look at her.  She sighed.  "Why won't you look at me for very long?  Do you dislike me that much?"

"You are everywhere.  Your pattern of existance is chaotic and brighter today than I've seen it since waking up.  It makes my stomach churn and my eyes hurt.  It's like staring into a kaledscope."  I didn't know how else to explain it.

"What do you mean, Nox?  I'm not a Magnus I should be no different than any other Venatori you see."  She sounded like she really beleived that.

I shook my head.  "You are Magnus.  You aren't like anything I've ever seen before."  I shruged, "Just because you never learned to bend doesn't mean you aren't Magnus.  Everyone except maybe Dorian only sees patterns when they want to.  I see them everywhere and have to purposely make them disapear to focus, but with you I can't."

"Can you prove your hypothesis?"  She asked me to prove that she was special or different.

I shrugged.  "Maybe.  You've been tested?"

She nodded.  "I was told I didn't have the natural ability to bend any element."

"Did they not test you to see if you could be taught?"  I asked without hesitation.

"I would say yes.  But I wouldn't really know for sure what tests they did." 

I held up my hands and wove four balls of a singular element each and they floated above my hands a hairs breath from my skin.  I could feel the warmth of the fire, and the swirl of the air against my skin.  I felt like my hand underneath the water was slick with sweat but I knew that it was dry.

"Focus on each ball.  Pretend they are like an a seive.  Draw an imaginary brown line from you to the brown one in my hand.  Focus on it and think of sand through an hour glass.  Pour all that sand into the globe."

Dr. Eriksen asked, "What will that do?"

"It's a technique Dae'lin taught me to calm my erratic patterns.  By focusing on one element at a time and pouring it elsewhere I was able to harness it.  You don't have to beleive you have the ability to do so, indulge me."

"This isn't going to work."  Dr. Eriksen didn't sound nearly as confident in her denial as I think she had hoped.  

I smiled.  "Focus."  I watched as the earth element drew in upon her and extended past her, she of course didn't see it because she didn't beleive she could.  "Now draw a blue line from the center of you to the water globe."

She did as I asked and I watched the water calm down around her, but she asked, "Why are you specifying colors?"

I grinned.  "You'll eventually understand.  Draw a red line from you to the fireball." The more Dr. Eriksen did as I asked the easier it became, and she was pushing the yellow line before I even asked her.  "Draw a yellow line to the ball of air."  

I smiled happily at her, "Hold your hands up.  Imagine a ball of air floating above your hand."

It was almost instantaneous.  A small ball of air floated above her hand and she lost control of it and the air puffed out ruffling the papers in front of Dr. Eriksen.  "I did that."

I nodded, "Now that you are under control, I can see what you are."

"What **I** am?"  She sounded like she was an alien now.  

"Yes, what you are.  You are special.  None like you that I know of - except..."  Dr. Eriksen's pattern looked near identical to another one I knew.  I grinned.  Oh Dorian would just love that.  

"Well... are you going to tell me?"  I could tell she was anxious and curious, her voice was squeaky like a teenage girls.

I laughed, "Eruditus Cesari - level 4."

She shook her head, "That's impossible."

"Not impossible because here you sit.  Improbable, never happened before, but not impossible."  I laughed; that was exactly what Dorian had told me when I was a kid when I told him I was impossible.  My birth was improbable, my existance improbable, that I was cesari was improbable, that I was the strongest cesari he'd ever studied was improbable, but it was **not** impossible.  I was not impossible.  I smiled to myself.  It had taken me a very long time to accept my differences, and now I could actually help someone else through the same thing.

She was of a scientific mind.  She wasn't like me, some kid who needed to be reassured.  How could a man like Dorian ever want a kid like me - always needing something.  I sighed and when I looked up I saw the Dr. Eriksen was watching me with concern in her eyes.  

She asked, "What's wrong?"

I shrugged, "Nothing.  Just thinking."

"So I can be taught to bend all four elements at the same time?"  She smiled at me, she knew I didn't want to talk about it.  This was the difference between a phsychologist and a researcher or medical doctor.  She at least left me to my own depressed thoughts.

I nodded.  "You can be taught how to bend all four elements.  But for now you should be able to control a single element with rudamentary control and your pattern should calm down.  I'm surprised no one has ever told you before you are chaotic."

She laughed, "There was one recently - besides you."

"Let me guess - Dorian Vega."

She nodded.  "Yes.  He said something similar to you though he never stopped looking at me like you did."

"He doesn't see it as clearly as I do."  I didn't want to tell her what I suspected of Dorian as well.  He was skeptical.  But he might be more compliant now that he'd touched fire.  It made me wonder if everyone could learn to bend each element.  There was a lot of things to think about.

Dr. Eriksen sat up straighter. "I didn't come here to talk about me however.  It is you that is the bigger mystery."

I shrugged.  "If you say so.  My existance has not been impossible until now."

She shook her head.  "It has, Nox.  The Aeternus have been all but extinct for milenia.  And yet, here you stand against all odds."

"I am not Aeternus.  I am not immortal, nor am I even close to being Venatori."  I laughed.  I was improbable not an impossiblity.

"Think about it," she said with conviction.  "You are improbable already.  Your birth alone is unique among living Venatori today.  You and your mother both survived.  How do you think that is possible?"  She spoke with her hands, they waved and emphasised her words to near distraction.  "You healed Dorian, and Emilio.  Which everyone believes to be impossible."

I interrupted, "I didn't heal them.  They healed themselves. I supplied the raw resources to their bodies so that their extraordinary healing could do its job without having to create the resources."

Dr. Eriksen frowned, "How do you know this?  How long have you know about this?"

I shrugged.  "I didn't exactly think it was uncommon.  I stumbled upon it by accident actually.  I got bit by a vampire."  I tugged my sleeve of my left arm up and showed her the scar that was there.  "I was too far from a hospital and I had nothing with me to serve as a bandage.  So I did the only thing I thought to do, I wrapped myself with threads of the power.  I actively held the wrap as I drove.  I didn't think anything of it as I drove to the nearest hospital.  As I was about to pull into the driveway to the ER I was awake and not shaking as I'd expect to be from the distance I had to drive.  I glanced down at my arm and saw red and raw skin where there should have been a gapping hole.  I wiped the blood with my hand and my arm was whole.  I didn't go to the ER that day.  I didn't do anything but go to my hotel room and take a shower."

Dr. Eriksen pulled out her tablet and started flipping through screens.  I added,"You won't find that in the report.  I didn't think it was important to mention.  I didn't know that it was unknown.  Like I didn't know that people see the patterns differently than I do.  I figured all my descrepancies in imagry was just me, or wasn't worth noting by others."

"So then explain to me what you think happened to you when you jumped.  You do have a theory right?"  She sounded afraid that I didn't have one.  

I grinned at her.  "I had healed Emilio.  I'd healed Dorian.  Maybe the fact that I didn't drop the connection until I crashed catalized something.  Honestly I can't tell you what happened.  I can't see my own patterns.  Dorian told me that the patterns looked exactly like what happens when I supplied the raw resources to a wound."

"How did you show him that?"  

I frowned.  "I'd rather not say or show you in that fashion.  And I'm stuck here so you are kinda outta luck on me finding something for you to view."  I wasn't going to cut myself in front of the doctor who was holding me here because she thought I was a danger to myself.

"So you are saying you supply raw resources - the elements to heal?"

I shrugged.  "I can only tell you what I do.  I'm not a researcher or a scientist, I have no explanation for you.  I didn't do anything.  My body took over, it pulled the raw resources from around me and I healed.  I am still healing."

Dr. Eriksen handed me a bottle.  "I have a confession to make."

I looked at the bottle of pills and frowned.  "What are these?"  I couldn't pronounce the name on the bottle.

A flush rose in Dr. Eriksen's cheeks and she looked down, "It's a poison.  It's what you've been taking."

What??  She's been poisoning me?  My mind scattered in several different direction and I had to pull myself together in order to process the information she continued to speak, "I had a theory.  I needed to test it.  I was correct in my hypothesis."

I felt the heat rising in my body.  I could feel the patterns shifting around me.  I saw Dr Eriksen's eyes widen in fear.  I whispered, "What was your theory?"  I could hear the white hot fury in my voice.  I could feel the tension in my jaw as I tried to refrain myself from yelling.  My hands hurt from the fists I was making.

"That you couldn't die."

I stood up and glared at the woman who was cowering before me now.  I could see it in her bent over posture, in the way she looked up at me with fear.  "So you tested your theory on me.  You poisoned me to see if I lived."  She nodded and I walked over to the door.  "I'm glad your little experiment worked."  I opened the door and walked through slamming it behind me.  Everyone in the hallway looked at me but no one said anything as I headed to my room.  This was beyond anything the Venatori had ever done to me.
