# New Room
_Wednesday, July 15, 2015 12:00 PM_

We walked through the sterile cooridors of the ICU.  I hadn't realized that was where I was at.  I hadn't really thought about it, but it explained much.  I mean I had jumped from the building, crushed nearly every bone in my body and damanged my insides.  A miracle I survived.  I had been awake the entire way down.  I felt the pain of it all before passing out because of the pain.  Though I was still foggy on why I survived when against all odds I should have not.  That was the first reason I was staying willingly.  They wanted to know exactly what I wanted to know.  How did I heal the way I did.  I could learn that without their help, but with experienced doctors I was more likely to figure it out sooner.

Madison took us to an elevator and I tried not to show my anxiety but she saw it and shook her head.  She said with a smile, "We can take the stairs."

I grinned back at her contiual desire to keep me happy.  "No, the elevator is fine."  The doors opened with a ding and we let the other passengers out.  It was an empty elevator when I stepped forward quelling my fears as I step on.  It was one floor.  I did the elevators without a problem usually, but today I felt out of my element.  

The doors slide closed and I stared at the reflection of us in the doors.  I realized in that moment that Madison wasn't flirting with me as I'd thought, she was used to working with mental patients.  I smiled at her reflection in the silver door.  "You do this for a living don't you."  She gave me that look of question with a cocked head.  "You tend to the needs and health concerns of patients in the psych ward.  Men and women who have been admitted for whatever reasons.  My hangups are old hat for you."

She nodded and smiled.  "Yes.  I've been a nurse with them since I started.  It's difficult sometimes.  But it's rewarding.  And I get to help all those people.  I'm in school trying to get my own doctorate in Psychology.   You should really try yourself - you've a very good handle on what's wrong with you.  I'm impressed."

I shook my head.  "I don't do memorization well.  I've been working on my issues since I was 6 and as I told the good doctor who admitted me I am my own greatest puzzle so it's in my nature to figure me out."  I turned and grinned at her.  "I don't care to get to know most people well enough to figure them out.  So it'd be rather pointless for a hunter."

She frowned and nodded as the door dinged open.  It had been more than one flor.  I hadn't counted but I knew we'd been in the elevator longer than necessary.  I asked, "The psych ward isn't in the Infirmary proper?"

Madison shook her head.  "No there are more residents than we have room for, so we've a secured location in the adult residences converted into comfortable rooms.  Most are long term patients anyway.  Too unstable to let out, very few who go in ever come out."

Fuck!  She must have seen the concern on my face.  "Oh don't worry, Nox.  You'll be fine.  Dr. Silverman has already started drawing up your paperwork to get you out.  She has final say afterall, she is your therapist."

"Little good that did me.  I'm still here."  She swipped a card past the sensor and the doors unlocked.  I grabbed the door before her and pulled it open.  She smiled at me with a nod of thanks.  I was not beyond being a gentleman at times.  And Madison had a place in my heart - wasn't love or anything, but she was special in her own right.

Madison greated the guards at the glass windows.  "Jerry and Sam this is Nox.  He'll be with us for a week."  

The shorter of the two guards nodded, his name tag read Sam.  "Dr. Silverman has his things already examined and we've put them in his room.  She reminded me to tell you that he needs to hear the rules - don't make assumptions with this one."

I laughed.  "Did she now."  I found the reminder funny, but the others with me just stared at me.  They of course didn't know me, but Margo did, she knows my quirks and issues better than I do.  She was thrawting any of my attempts to have a little fun while I was here.  

Madison took me by the arm and guided me through a common area.  "This is the common area.  You'll have assigned times to be here, and sessions to sit through as well as free time.  Everything works on a clock around here.  From your records that should work for you just fine."

I smiled.  "Yes.  It'll take a while to adjust but I'll be fine."

"We deal with misbehavior in one of two ways - isolation, or drugs.  Neither of which are very pleasant to watch from my perspective so please don't do anything stupid."  Madison swiped her card again and pushed open anoher set of doors.  "This is where the residents live.  Rooms are locked from the outside - for each individuals safety.  We monitor each room with cameras and each room has a two way intercom system should you need a nurse or some thing.  

I didn't like the idea of being caged like an animal.  But the rooms had windows to the outside and windows out to the hall.  None of the residents seemed out of sorts.  I supposed that was a good thing.  Though I did see several patterns of people who looked drugged out of their minds who could use fire.  I didn't say anything as we walked past their rooms, but I let it be.  I wondered if they knew how dangerous those two were truly.

Madison opened a wooden door with her key card.  I saw my duffle bag lying on the bare bed and my laptop as well as two brown paper bags with a card propped up against with my name neatly scrawled across it in Margo's hand.

"This is your room."  Madison and I walked in and the door closed behind us locking with in seconds.  She touched a button on the little box next to the door.  "Hey Sarah.  Room 305 is in place, you can switch the monitors on now." She turned to me, "You will have one of four nurses always on the other side of the intercom. My self and Sarah are on days, and Glroia and Shannon are on nights.  We watch over about a dozen residents so we might be busy, but one of us is always on watch."

I nodded and looked around the room for the camera.  Madison saw me and pointed to the descrete object on the ceiling.  It doubled as a fire sensor if I wasn't mistaken.  "The camera is there and we can see everywhere in this room from it."

I asked, "Is that for a fire starter as well?"

She frowned at me.  I was right.  "Yes.  We..."

I smiled my reassurance at her.  "At least it's not an orange door.  But do you have those two drugged patients in a fire starter room?"

Madison shrugged.  "Which two?"

I laughed.  "The only two that were drugged as we came down here.  They have erratic patterns of fire around them.  Drugged is probably okay but even then their patterns are so erratic I'd worry about fires."

Madison shook her head.  "No I don't think they are.  I will talk with their doctors."

I nodded.  "No worries I was just curious as I'm perfectly capable of controlling y abilitlies and I'm stuck in a fire starter room and those two are in normal rooms.  I was just warning you."

Madison smiled.  "Thank you.  I will discuss it further with their doctors.  I need to go now.  Lunch is served in our cafeteria in about 30 minutes.  You've some time.  The doors will unlock and you will just need to go with the others.  Dr. Silverman has food in one of those bags.  But that is not for lunch.  It is for inbetween timed meals.  She is concerned with your lack of energy since waking up."

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am."

Madison swiped the card on the sensor again and the door unlocked and she opened the door and stood in the doorway.  "I will be back after lunch and we can discuss your schedule.  I'd do it now, but you don't have much time before lunch so I'll let you settle in."

"Thanks."  I watched Madison leave and stood staring at the glass window before turning around to see what things I had.  First things first though I opened the duffle bag and sitting on top was a gray hoodie neatly folded and I smiled as I unfurled it from its storage and pulled it on.

I could survive without the fleece lying against my skin and the weight of the hood around my neck but I felt better knowing there was no chance someone was going to get past my defenses.  It was my security blanket.

The bag had been newly packed - another pair of shoes at the bottom, a few t-shirts and a few more jeans as well as carefully packed underthings.  How nice of Margo to think of all things.  There was also a few other things in the bag that I found amusing.  Margo had packed my current journal of nightmares.  She called them dream journals but since all my dreams were nightmares that was all that was inside.  The same images over and over again.  I sighed.  I actually had quite a few days worth of nightmares to sketch in.

She had also packed a few books and brochures.  I frowned at the Columbia University brochures and an application as well.  She and I were going to have to talk about that.  I struggled through school, college didn't seem like the best fit for me.  But she didn't do anything without a reason.  I didn't like the feeling that gave me.

I turned my laptop on and set it on the small table across from my bed and let it do it's thing.  I had to think about it but I didn't have a laptop - Jace broke mine.  I wondered whose it was and why was it here.  I sat down on the bed and opened the enevelope.  The card read on the outside, "Get well soon!"

I laughed.  I wasn't exactly sick to get well soon.  Inside Margo had written cleanly.

    I figured you'd get a kick out of the cover since you can't get better from the reason you are in this room.  Your father picked up a new laptop - he said Nate picked it out and that he didn't skimp on the specs.  He figured you'd be bored out of your mind locked up like an animal.  And I'm afraid he is probably correct.  You need to eat more than you usually do.  Your health while miraculous has taken a toll on you, and is why you have been in a near state of sleep since waking up.  Eat boy, or I'll have the nurses force feed you. And I know how much you'd enjoy that.  To quell your boredom I have a task for you.  Dorian and Dae'lin are both insistant that you see things differently.  Show us how different you see things.  I have included another journal in the bags, with colored pencils, draw what you see.  Give us a clear picture of your abilities.  Maybe it'll help us understand you better, or understand the reason you survived.  I know that's plaguing you as well as everyone else.  We will get you out as soon as possible, but when the Eriksen's want something it is difficult to deter them - Margo
    
I grinned as I read it.  But I didn't have time to reflect on it before the door unlocked and I heard a near stampede outside my room as lunch had been served.
