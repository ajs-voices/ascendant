# Good News

My morning went through the motions as per usual.  Lunch and then it was time for me to meet with Margo.  I was seeing a lot of that woman.  Lori taught Jo and I a game of cards while we waited for my appointment.  

The rules were simple try to get rid of your cards.  Round and round in a circle you play ones, twos, threes, etc until someone is out of cards.  But if you don't beleive the card is that you can call "bullshit!"  and the player has to show their cards.  Depending on who won the challenge the loser has to pick up the whole discarded pile.  

We really didn't get far in the game before I had to leave.  Lori liked to yell out Bullshit! so she had a handful of cards.  Duke took my place as I followed Margo out to our little sitting room. 

I sat down and waited for the lecture I was about to receive.  Margo sat down in her chair opposite me and adjusted her skirt and her jacket and then looked down her nose at me through her little glasses.  I knew she was angry with me.  I tried not to smirk but I could feel it splaying on my lips before she raised an eyebrow at me.  "Something funny?"  Margo asked.

I shook my head.  "No ma'am.  I'm awaiting the lecture I know is coming."

"Do you know what you did Nox?"

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am I do.  I didn't follow your instructions.  I created a scene and I refused my medication."

Margo sighed.  "Dr. Wilton handed me the letter of recomendation as I walked into the ward this afternoon.  Would you like me to read it?"

"Why not?"  I wanted to hear what Leroy had to say about me.

Margo adjusted her glasses on her nose and started.  "From the Desk of Dr. Harry Wilton aka Leroy."  I chuckled but when Margo looked up from the letter I cut it short and clamped my mouth shut with a click.  I would refrain from my comments.  No peanut gallery as she'd often tell me as a child.  "It is with my deepest regret that I inform you that I can no longer attend to the needs of one, Mr. Nox Sétanta due to a comapatability issue.  However it is with in the best interest of this establishment to reliquish Mr. Sétanta from the suicide evaluation in house to a more appropriate out patient program.  I deem him a danger to himself, but not in the form of suidical attempts on his own life.  This risks he takes are calculated.  The only danger he is in from himself is that of his poor attitude towards everyone around him and others wishing to end his life prematurely.  Dr. Silverman is fully capable of controlling this young man and should be the one making these calls.  Sincerly, Dr. H. Wilton."

Margo looked up at me.  "What did you say to him?"

"You mean you've not watched the tape yet?"  I grinned at her playfully.

She sighed.  "You know I have.  Nox, while your outburst seems to have swayed the good doctor you paint yourself in very poor light."

I shrugged.  "What do I care if he thinks I'm a nimrod or a jack ass.  It's what everyone else thinks I am anyways."

Margo sighed.  "They will let you go tomorrow morning.  Your father will be here in the morning to take you home."

I nodded, "Does that mean we are done here?"

"No I'm afraid not.  I also watched Dr. Eriksen's interview with you.  Nurse Hatch has informed me that you don't wish it to be brought up to higher authorities.  Is that true?"

"Just leave it be, please."  I sighed.  "If you want to help then help me get the little wolf out of her too."

"The little wolf?"

"Jo.  She isn't unstable, she's on the verge of her change.  She needs to find someone to help her.  Transitioning in here will go badly for everyone."

"Why do you care, Nox?"

I sighed.  "I don't know.  I really don't, but I do.  LouAnn said I was her Alpha now.  She didn't elaborate."

"You aren't wolf much less were anything."  Margo shook her head.  

"I know.  My life just keeps getting weirder and weirder."  I agreed with her whole-heartedly.

"Let me speak with your little wolf.  I will make my assessment on that."  Margo pulled out a pad from her briefcase and started jotting down information.  "Please bring her here."

I stood up and saluted.  She rolled her eyes at me.  I opened the door and left it open.  I found Jo and Lori still playing cards with Duke.  I knelt down beside her.  "You want to get out of here, Jo?"

She looked at me with quizical eyes.  "I guess."

I grinned up at her reaction.  "I mean out of the psych ward?  Margo might be able to help but she needs to talk to you."

"Oh."  She laughed.  Wrong impression I guess.  I smiled at her.

She stood up.  "You play my hand."  I nodded and she kissed the top of my forehead leaving a very faint scent of forest behind her.  I closed my eyes and savored the smell before it wafted away on the next current in the room.

I really hated the smell of this place.  It was driving me nuts.

Lori giggled at me as I sat down in Jo's seat.  "What?" I asked.  

She shook her head.  "Nothing.  I think Dorian is going to have a run for his money if she gets out of here."

I rolled my eyes.  "As if Dorian would even notice."

Lori nearly fell over in a fit of giggles.  I turned around and saw why.  Dorian stood not 1 foot away from my chair.  He smiled down at me.  "I wouldn't notice what?"

I laughed.  "That I exist."

The smile slipped on Dorian's face and I grinned up at him.  "You here to see what I came up with last night?"  He nodded.  "Alright, come on then.  Leave this girl to her giggling."

Dorian followed behind me as I lead him back to my room.  I swipped my card hopefully for close to the last time.  He came in with a half smile.  "You know I notice that right?"

I laughed, "Dorian.  Let's not do that alright.  You weren't supposed to hear my fustration.  And Lori has been poking at it since Jo commented on something similar.  So not only am I now her gay friend.  I'm hooking up with Jo to make you jealous.  So please let's not go there and do what you came here to do."

I didn't mean half of what I said.  I wanted to know what he thought of the whole situation.  I wanted to know if there was a chance at all.  But I didn't really want to know that either.  He wanted to be friends.  I was going to make myself be okay with that.  I had to or this was going to drive me crazy and then I'd really be in here for good.

I shook my head then pointed at the three plants.  "Can you tell the difference?"

Dorian looked at me for several more moments before he turned his attention to the plants.  Dorian looked at each one, he even felt the leaves.  "Okay one is clearly a replica, but where did the second one come from?"

I smiled.  "I made it."

Dorian turned to look at me with shock written all over his face.  "I didn't make it from nothing.  Essentially I cloned a new plant from an existing one much like you would take a cutting and put it in water and let it take root."

"You cloned it?"

"I guess that's the most efficient term for it.  I didn't create it.  I didn't heal it.  It grew itself at an excellerated rate.  I supplied raw materials and it grew.  I made the pot and duplicated the earth, but the plant did all the work with a little help from me."

Dorian sat down at the desk with the notebooks.  "Did you document it all?"

I nodded.  "As much as I could.  I don't know if it'll help you understand."

Dorian stared at the notebook for what felt like hours.  He flipped back and forth between pages and wrote down things in the margins and over the patterns themselves.  I watched him for a while then I left him to my room to do his thing.  "I'm going to go hang out in the common room."

He only nodded as I left the room.  Philip was walking past and he fell in step.  "He seems interested in something."

I smiled.  "Yeah.  His life's work."  I sighed and I kept walking I didn't want to talk about Dorian.  I didn't want to feel what I felt.  My heart was racing because Dorian was studying **my** work.  He was going over my work with a fine tooth comb because he was interested in it.  My ego soared and yet my heart fell each time I thought about him.  I was extatic and depressed at the same time and it was such an odd feeling.

We entered the common room and Lori immediately latched on to my arm and dragged me over to the couch with her and Joe and Cliff.  I think I sat on Amelia.  Cliff only chuckled to himself as I moved to the side to accomodate his imaginary friend.  Lori curled up against me and Jo watched me from the side of her eye.  I smiled, "Do you want to tell me what happened?"

She smiled back at me and took my hand and pulled me away from everyone else.  Lori hurmphed and pouted as she watched us walk away.  I could almost hear her lip sticking out.  

We walked past my room where Dorian was still paging through my notes.  She swiped her card and opened the door to her room.  I didn't feel right going in.  It meant something different when a girl lets you in her room.  She pulled me behind her and closed the door.  Her room was near identical to mine, except her's looked lived in.  A blue carpet on the floor and several posters and drawings adored the wall.  She sat down on the bed and I leaned against her desk.  I didn't want to be close.  This was making me nervous.

She looked at me with wide brown eyes and I couldn't help but smile.  "What did Margo say?"

"I don't want to be let out of here Nox."  She looked sad almost broken.  I knew exactly how that felt.

I took a deep breath and sat down next to her.  "Why?"

"This is the best home I've had."  She looked down and played with her fingernails.  

"You can have better than here."  Jo put her hand on my knee and looked up at me and shook her head.  "I know you can.  Even outside these walls is better than in here."

"No.  Here I get to eat everyday, I have a warm and dry place to sleep.  People who care for me.  I don't want to leave."

"I understand that, Jo.  My life is crap outside these walls.  But I don't want to live in here either.  I want my own life, my own family.  This isn't family."  I was going to lose this battle.  I could feel it.

"How's gonna want a broken werewolf?"

I laughed.  "The same people who would want an arrogant boy who has a large amount of issues to deal with.  Family is not blood Jo.  Family is those people who are there for you no matter what.  Outside here we make our own family."

Jo shook her head.  "I can't Nox."  

I sighed.  "Alright, but what did Margo say?"  I got up and started for the door.  I turned around and looked back at the little wolf sitting on the bed.  

"She agreed with you."

I nodded.  "You don't belong here Jo.  I can help you."  I opened the door.  "I'm leaving tomorrow morning.  I didn't even stay a week before I made too much trouble."  I grinned at her.  "I will be back on the 30th and we'll see how you feel about things then.  Someone has to watch out for you and if I'm your Alpha I guess it has to be me."

I walked out the door and pulled the door closed behind me.  Margo always says you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.  At the times she said it she was referring to me and my own issues.  And I eventually came around to wanting to be helped but now I understood the other side of it.  Jo didn't want out.  I couldn't make her.

I went back to my room and Dorian was still studying things I'd done.  I flopped down on my bed and it distracted Dorian.  He looked behind him at me and frowned, "Something wrong."

I shook my head.  "Nothing to worry about.  You keep doing what you are doing and don't mind me."

"Do you want to talk about it?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I'm okay Dorian.  Just a life full of fustration.  You can take that if you want.  I'm getting out in the morning, we can schedule time when I'm out of here and know what they let me do with the out patient program.  Someplace I'm free from Dr. Eriksen's manipulations."

Dorian turned the chair around and looked at me like he was gauging my progress.  He tapped his fingers against his knee that he'd crossed over his other leg.  He finally said something.  "She's not that bad."

I sighed.  "Dorian she tried to kill me to prove her hypothesis.  I'm expendable.  I'd prefer not to be a lab rat."  I pulled my pillow from under my head and covered my face.  My journal slid to the floor and I heard Dorian pick it up and start leafing through it.

He walked over and dropped it next to my head.  "While the imagry is pretty aweful the drawing are rather good.  I didn't know you drew so well.  We should have given you a few art classes."

I lifted the pillow and looked up into the bright blue eyes of the man who was making my head spin.  "I wouldn't have liked drawing then.  I am glad you didn't."

Dorian smiled and I covered my face again.  He was making me gush inside.  I lifted the pillow high enough to speak.  "I will call you tomorrow Dorian.  Take the two I made with you but leave the one you gave me please."

Dorian stood there for a few moments before he walked over to the desk with a steady pace.  I could hear the leather sole's tapping across the floor until he was gone.  I threw the pillow across the room and curled up on my bed facing the wall.  So much for the good news of leaving.
