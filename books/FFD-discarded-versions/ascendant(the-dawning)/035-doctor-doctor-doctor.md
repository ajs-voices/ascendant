# Doctor.  Doctor.  Doctor.
_Tuesday, July 21, 2015 9:30 AM_

It was busy in the infirmary as I made my way to Dr. Eriksen's office.  I had to ask for directions twice.  She resided in the research part of the facility rather than an actual medical side.  This did not bode well.

I knocked on the perscribed door as the girl at the reception desk told me they are waiting for you.  I didn't ask what I wanted to but who the hell are they?  And what the fuck do they want?  But I kept that to myself and waited patiently for the door to open.  

And of course the man who interrupted things last night pulls open the door and gives me a shocked look.  "Dr. Eriksen, a young man is here."

The chaotic pattern of Dr. Eriksen was in front of me before I could react.  I closed my eyes and flinched.  I couldn't look at her without wanting to vomit.  She was chaotic and more so than I'd seen her before.  She must be furstrated.  I asked without thinking, "Fustrated?"

"Come in Nox.  We've much to start discussing."  I looked at Todd and he was shocked.

Dr. Eriksen spoke quickly.  "Everyone this is Nox SÃ©tanta, he is the subject in question.  Nox, this is Dr. Todd Ingram the foremost leading expert in supernatural DNA and genetic mutations"

I laughed.  "HA! You think I've mutated?"

Todd grinned at me, "No, actually I don't.  Despite what the pretty doctor here might suggest.  But let's get the introductions out of the way first."

I shrugged.  "Dr.  Eriksen, do you remember what I asked you to do?  I can't look at you and it is making everythng so much more distracting."

Todd was still confused.  I tried to alleviate that with an explanation.  "I see patterns around people - part of my so-called gift.  Dr. Eriksen is an untaught Eruditus Magnus and doesn't beleive me."

Dr. Eriksen laughed.  "No I don't remember.  Remind me."

I sighed.  "The four colored lines.  Draw them in your mind slowly from you to an imagine ball of color in your palm. Here let me show you.  In detail."

"Do what I do except in your head.  Sometimes it helps to hold your hands out and mime out the actions.  I'll show you the physical manifestation so you get it."

I held my hands in fron of me and four balls of solid color appeared and floated above my hands.  There were three gasps from the room, one of which I had yet to met.  Apparently no one had ever seen the four elements worked at the same time.

I let my aura manifest itself.  It was something I'd learned to do to by accident.  Dae'lin had told me not to do it.  Told me it was showing off.  She said it was a rare talent and people didn't like it.  There was no one who would be impressed by a color show behind me but three near complete strangers stared at me with their mouths wide open.  I sighed.  "Back on task please."  I drew upon water first and pushed it into the ball.  Drawing a physical line that reduced the aura's intensity from me.  The control was mine to begin with but the dimming effect was obvious to them.  I did it for air, then earth and lastly fire.  Everything was pushed into the balls and the three scientists in front of me were still staring at me with looks of astonishment.  I had to ask, "What?"

The man I never was introduced to stepped out of their little clique and held out his hand to me.  "Dr. Emmet Chan.  Don't ask."  He grinned at me with wide eyed speculation.  "Can all Cesari do that?"

I shrugged.  "I've never met another Cesari besides Mark Green.  Dorian Vega would be the best person to answer that question."

Dr. Chan nodded.  "I am familiar with his work.  We've met once, he gave a talk on Cesari and one little boy in particular."

I bowed and Todd laughed.  "Emmet, that is the little boy Dorian fawned over."

"I forget you know Dr. Vega.  Perhaps you can get him to join us as well. I beleive that while I may be an expert of Venatori physiology and Magnus in particular, Cesari are a unique topic I didn't have the chance to study in great detail."

Todd nodded.  "I'm sure Dr. Vega is busy, but would be more than willing to come discuss is life's work with the lot of us.  I will give him a call and the five of us can get down to the anolomies we see."

"Anomolies?" I asked.  What anomolies?  I knew I was improbable but this went far beyond that.  

Dr. Eriksen interruptted.  "Nox? Is that better?"

I turned to look at her without thinking but was not blinded by a chaotic aura.  I nodded. "Yes ma'am.  Thank you."

She smiled at me.  "I'm sorry.  I will do better to remember the sensitivity of our subject the next time."

"I really wish you'd not call me that."  I wasn't some lab rat to be discussed and experimented on.

I saw Todd hang up his phone and moments later my phone rang.  I laughed.  "You didn't tell him I was here did you?"

Todd shook his head, "Should I have?"

I grinned and answered my phone. "Hey Dorian."

"Hey back.  Didn't you have an appointment with Dr. Eriksen this morning?"

I nodded my head. "Yeah you are kinda interrupting it right now."

Dorian's voice was filled with concern.  "Is something wrong?"

"No.  At least she hasn't told me there is anything wrong yet.  I've met two other doctors and they are waiting on a third before we get started.  I think he's on the phone right now."  

Dorian asked, "Nox, what's going on?  Todd just called me and asked me to come enlighten his collegues with my knowledge of Cesari - specifically the little boy I studied."

I laughed.  "Dorian just come down here so they will tell me what the fuck is going on.  Dr. Chan beleives your insights into Cesari could be of use.  If you would be so kind Doctor Vega to join us I would be most humbled."

Dorian chuckled.  "Alright, if you insist."

"I do.  See ya in a few."  I hung up my phone and Dr. Chan was staring at me with wide eyes.

"You are on a first name basis with Dr. Vega?  I would think that inappropriate."

I laughed, "You don't even know the half of it."

Each of the three doctors went to their laptops and started staring at the screens while they waited for Dorian to chow up.  Todd called me over and patted the chair next to him.  "Tell me what patterns you see here."

"Alright."  I took the laptop from him and held it with one hand.  I looked at it until there was a knock at the door.  Dr. Chan answered the door as I pointed out to Todd what I saw.  "It's a sequential pattern, from here to here, and it repeats again here.  The bits between don't seem to match."

Todd nodded.  "Do you know it took me two months to find that pattern before I resorted to a computer algorithm to do it for me?"

I shrugged.  "I see patterns everywhere, it's just that simple."

Dorian laughed.  "You'll get used to it Todd.  He's been doing it to me for over 15 years."

"Doing what?"  Todd asked.

"Making your life's work look simple."  Dorian answered.

I really hated being talked about in front of my face.  Dorian came over to me and took my hands in his and whispered, "You okay?"

I nodded.  "Could be worse, I could be being poked with needles."

Dorian frowned.  "I'm sure they'd like more DNA samples."

I paled.  I felt the blood rush from my face and I felt queezy.  This was not going to be a good thing.  Dorian pulled me to him and kissed me softly.  "It's alright.  I'll hold your hand."

I grinned at him and kissed him with a little more vigor before I pushed him away.  "Not in front of your colleagues."

He laughed.  I was more than impressed with his public display of affection.  More importantly I was in awe of the fact that he'd done it in front of Dr. Chan.  Dr. Chan was staring at us with his jaw dropped.  I grinned at him.  "I told you, you didn't know the half of it."

Dorian walked over to Dr. Chan.  "I see you've already met my boyfriend."

I turned and looked at Dorian.  "We are really doing this?"

He nodded.  "I told you no more fear.  No more hiding."

I grinned, "Alrighty then."

Dr. Chan nodded, "I had no idea your relationship was so informal."

Dorian smiled, "It wasn't until about a month ago when there was a loss in  my family and a rogue Venatori hunting us down like cattle.  Things like that put a little perspective on things."

Dr. Chan nodded slowly.  "I had heard about the loss of your mother, she will duley missed."  He bowed formally as he took Dorian's hand.

Dorian bowed slightly, "Thank you."

Dorian put his arm around me.  "Dr. Eriksen, if you intend to draw any blood from Nox.  I suggest you do it while I'm here, or you'll find it difficult."

Todd laughed, "He's afraid of needles?"

Dorian smiled at his friend, "Among other things."

Dr. Eriksen patted a chair that was sitting next to her.  "Amara please.  We are all colleagues here - even you Nox.  Come sit and let's get this over with."

I sighed and looked at Dorian.  I was suddenly very nauseous.  Dorian navigated me towards the chair gently.  Todd looked at me as I sat down and shook his head, "What else are you afriad of?"

I answered, knowing fully well Dorian's friend was taking my mind off of what was right in front of me.  "Heights."

"What the fuck where you doing jumping off a building if you are afraid of heights?"  Todd sounded incredulous.

I grinned and yelped at the same time as the needle pricked my skin.  I could feel the blood rushing away from my face and I clenched Dorian's hand.  "I jump from the building often.  I created in my wake a sort of cult of earth and air benders who made a sport of the feat they copied from me.  I used it to conquer my fear of heights.  But in that particular instance I was chasing a kid who'd stabbed Dorian, my father and his, and killed Dorian's mother."

Todd shook his head, "Danger boy."

I shrugged and Dr. Eriksen, no Amara she pulled the needle from my arm and my entire body relaxed from the tension of the fear coursing through my body.  Dorian dropped my hand and shook the blood back into his fingers I looked up at him in apology, "Sorry man."

"It's okay, it's just my hand.  I don't need it."  Dorian chimed without thinking who's company he was in.

I smirked and started to say something but Todd guffawed then said, "I like him."  He was speaking specifically to Dorian who was smiling at his best friend.  

Dorian shook his head.  "I'm in trouble."
