# Lunch Date
_Sunday, July 19, 2015 12:00 PM_

My stomach rumbled.  I was going to have to eat one way or the other.  I called Dorian.  

"Dorian."

"Hey."  I said without thinking.  I could hear the hope in my own voice in that single word.

"Hey yourself.  You done?"  Dorian asked.

"Yeah.  I'm starving.  Can we talk over lunch?"  My stomach rumbled again.  "I ate at like 4 this morning."

"We can.  Where would you like to go?"

"I can make us something."

Dorian laughed.  "That was a rather silly question.  I'll meet you at your place then.  My kitchen is barren as to be expected."

"Okay.  I'll see you there."  I started up the stairs.  10 flights, two stairs at a time.  I was getting a good bit of exercise this morning.  I was more than willing and I had actually missed it.

I made it to my apartment before Dorian.  We didn't exactly set a time but I assumed it was sooner rather than later.  I started prepping lunch for two.  Lunch usually varied with what leftovers I had the night before.  I wasn't exactly keen on having anything of last nights dinner again.  I opted for grilled chicken salad on rye.

I managed to get everything done by the time Dorian knocked.  I washed my hands and opened it with a smile.  But it wasn't Dorian at my door.  "Stella."

She smiled up at me.  "You have a few minutes.  I wanted to ask you something."

"Sure.  Come on in."  I waved her in and shut the door behind her.

Stella came in and sat down at the bar.  "I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?"

I shook my head.  "No just waiting on Dorian.  So I can eat while we work out my current career path.  What did you need, Stella?"

"I don't know who else to talk to about these things."  I was hoping that it was not relationship advice.  I really didn't want to talk about Garrett.  I had nothing nice to say about him.  I tried to focus on what she was saying but I kept getting lost in my own train of thought.  It took all my effort but I focused on the woman in front of me.  "You are like Aidan right?  Half human."

I nodded.  "Yeah."  This was about Aidan.  I could do that.

"I've been seeing a few people looking down their noses at him.  Like he's weak.  I don't like it.  I honestly don't like a lot about the Venatori."  Stella confided.  "And then Dorian is gay and that doesn't help anything.  Garrett says it's not going to get better.  But he's Venatori.  I wanted to know what you thought."

I hated agreeing with Garrett.  I really didn't want to say he was right, but as it stood he was right.  It wasn't going to get easier.  "Garrett says he can help Aidan."

I interrupted.  "NO."  I could feel my hackles rise, Garrett would not touch that boy in any room anywhere if I had a say in the matter.

"Why not?"

I shook my head.  "Just no.  I will help him.  He's in the class Richard Weston wants me to teach.  I got it handled I promise."  

Stella looked releived that I was acting jealous.  I was **not** jealos of Garrett.  I was terrified of him and what he might do to Aidan.

I sighed.  "But Garrett is right.  It won't get easier.  But with the right training early enough and if he's anything like his momma or his father then he'll not have the same issues I did.  And Dorian's sexuality should not put Aidan under any other harassement.  If someone is report it.  Dorian is well respected in our world.  Being his son is only going to help him.  He is one of the ruling family line.  He will be more than fine."

"I don't get this ruling family bullshit."

I laughed.  "It has been this way since time began.  The eight ruling families run the Venatori overseen by the most powerful Magnus.  The Eriksen's, Vega's, Viddens', Dowager's, the Rivera's, the Stone's, the Haskin's and the Eskridge's have all been one of the eight ruling classes for nearly ten centuries when the world became more civilized and the ruling classes stopped trying to kill each other.  The supernatural world is very the strongest is the leader in nearly every creature and culture we know to exist.  The Venatori are no different."

"To become werewolf pack leader you kill the existing pack leader.  And the Venatori are the same, but we've gone soft and it passes down to eldest of the next generation.  Dorian will never rule the family line, but he is the son of a Vega and that means something.  Just like I won't ever rule the Viddens family line, but it has certain advantages."  I waved my hand at the room.  "Though that is only partially why my digs were upgraded."

Stella shook her head.  "That's the other thing.  This we don't get a real paycheck thing.  Everything is provided to us and our status dictates how much, where we live.  It's so socialist and reminds me of how Russia used to be back in the days of the Cold War.  I work hard and I get little from it because I'm unmarried, and human."

I shrugged.  "I don't know what to tell you about that.  It's the way it's always been for me.  Living as a normal citizen of the United States of America is foreign to me.  I can't imagine having to work a day job that I don't enjoy to pay for my measely apartment and buy food and still not make ends meet.  I want for nothing here.  I do my job to the best of my ability and I get better at it.  I understand the fustration.  But there is only one solution to fix that for you."

"What's that?"  Stella asked.

"Leave the Venatori.  Things aren't going to change.  You can complain all you want and you'll gain more advantages once Aidan's tested and designated a Magnus.  You won't just be human anymore, you'll be the mother of the first Magnus in the Vega line."

"Yeah that's just great."  I could hear the sarcasm dripping from her voice, "Dorian's line makes my life better.  When it's because of him I'm here in the first place.  And he doesn't even love me."

I frowned.  "I'm sorry Dorian did what he did.  But Aidan isn't a mistake."

She looked up at me and frowned.  "Dorian thinks so."

I shook my head.  "No, Stella, he doesn't.  Dorian is just not used to showing what he feels.  Trust me.  He loves Aidan.  He couldn't love you, but he loves Aidan.  He will provide for him.  He will take care of him.  And he will always love him.  He is his son."

"How do you know?"  Stella sounded like she didn't beleive a word I said.

"Because I know Dorian Vega.  He cares about his image, but that's because he cares about his family.  His family looked down on him for his life's choices.  So he stood up to it by presenting himself in a light that they were proud of.  And in doing so he hides behind his mask of perfection and disassociation.  But he's not that person.  He's kind and caring.  If he can let some strange five year old cling to him then he will certainly let his own flesh and blood cling to his love."

Stella sighed.  "I don't know, Nox.  He's so distant with me."

I smiled.  "Because he doesn't want to lead you on like he did in the past.  He'll get better with Aidan.  I promise.  He loves him to death.  He wants to be a part of your life and Aidan's, I know it."

"I don't know.  I don't know if I want to stay here.  But if I leave Aidan could die."  She sounded lost.

"Then leave him here.  He has family.  You'll get to see him still.  Or take him away and bring him back for his lessons.  But either way you need to make a choice Stella.  Aidan can do great things here.  You just have to let him try."

There was a knock at the door.  "That's probably Dorian."

Stella nodded.  "I should get going.  You've at least given me something to think about.  We should get the boys together again."

I smiled.  "Drake would probably like that."  

Stella hopped off the bar stool and headed towards the door I was opening.  I grinned as I saw that it was Dorian.  "Hey Stella."  Dorian said with a smile.  

Stella smiled up at her once upon a time lover.  "He's waiting on you to eat."

Dorian looked at me and I shrugged.  "It hasn't been that long."

Stella laughed.  "I will have to get used to this I think."

Dorian looked at her quizically.  "Get used to what?"

"The father of my son hooking up with his best friend's guardian."  Stella chirped as she almost skipped down the hall.

I chuckled and Dorian rolled his eyes as he pushed me inside and shit the door.  He smiled, "What was that about?"

I smiled.  "She has a few issues with how Aidan is treated, her percfeptions of your status in the community and what she thinks about the Venatori."

Dorian nodded.  "Ah.  She came to you to understand Aidan and then vented."

I nodded.  "It seems that way.  She said _he_ offered to help Aidan.  I told her no and that I would be teaching him.  I think she thought I was jealous."

Dorian frowned, "You alright?"

I nodded and slide a plate across the bar to one of the stools as I made my own sandwich.  "I'll be fine.  Though I can't help but want to protect Aidan from him.  But I can't even protect myself."  I sighed.

Dorian walked around behind me and wrapped his arms around me.  "I'll protect you."

I smiled. "Thanks.  Go sit down and eat."

Dorian chuckled in my ear and kissed my neck softly and a small moan escaped my mouth as a shiver ran up my spin.  "Dorian.  Eat.  Please."  My stomach rumbled again in protest.  My heart was racing and I wanted to proceed with where Dorian was heading but I was starving.

Dorian laughed.  "Alright.  Why didn't you eat while Stella was here?"

I shrugged.  "I was waiting on you."

He rolled his blue eyes at me.  "Don't do that again."

I smiled as I grabbed two glasses for water.  "I'll try not to be so curtious next time."  Ice fell into the glass making a faint clinking sound and crackled as I added the water too it.  It was such a great thing to have cold water and ice so easily accessible.  I slide Dorian a glass and sat down next to him.  

I took a bite of my sandwich as my stomach rumbled again.  I ate a few bites before I asked Dorian, "So how do you want to do the test viewings?"

Dorian looked slightly disappointed in my change of topic.  But he smiled.  "I don't have many this week.  And they are all relatively late in the day.  I have three ten year olds who need testing, and a five year old who sparked."

"When do you want me to come up there then?"  I asked.

Dorian pulled out his phone and looked at his calendar.  "Here.  I'll send you the appointments.  The should fit the schedule you set up with Richard this morning.  All after 2pm."

I nodded and pulled out my phone as the messages started rolling in.  I smiled at Dorian.  "Such a good man.  I can work my schedule around that.  Is that the typical times for testing?"

"Yeah.  We do them in the afternoons still.  We can set a standing 2pm to 4pm appointment and either do testing and when we don't have kids to look at we can work on the training things.  That will give you a few hours in the afternoon for Dae'lin as well as the rest of the time you intend to spend on it."  Dorian finished off his sandwich and was looking at the preparations.  "Mind if I have another?"

I laughed. "Be my guest."  I watched as Dorian got up and started making another sandwich after washing his hands.  "That does sound like a good plan.  I've added it to my schedule and you can send me whatever testing appointments you get and that way I won't be surprised and stress out."

Dorian nodded as he slathered a thick layer of mayo on the bread.  I tried not to cringe but Dorian wasn't watching me so it didn't matter either way.  I continued to watch as he piled the chicken salad on to the rye and closed it.  He looked up and smiled. "Am I doing something wrong?"

I shook my head.  "Nope. I just like watching you."

He sat down on his bar stool next to me.  "You really need better chairs."

I laughed.  "Hey you picked them out."

Dorian sighed.  "I know.  I didn't think I'd be eating here nearly as often."

I picked up my plate and set in the sink and leaned on the bar facing Dorian.  "And where did you expect to be eating?"

Dorian grinned.  "Not in your apartment.  At least not anytime in the relatively near future.  But I'm glad to be here."

I smiled as I walked around the bar and stood next to Dorian.  "So what changed between when you picked out the chairs and now?"  I kinda already knew the answer but I was having fun flirting with Dorian this way.

He had just taken a bite of his sandwich when I asked he chewed slowly.  I think he was enjoying making me wait.  I watched the way his mouth moved and watched as he swallowed then washed it all down with a swallow of water before he turned to look up at me from the uncomfortable bar stool.  He smiled.  "Oh I don't know.  Someone professing their feelings after nearly dying."

"You walked out after that."  I said flatly as I sat down next to Dorian. 

Dorian nodded.  "I was afraid of things.  You made it clear what you wanted out of it.  I was surprised and still trying through a decision I had made."

"A decision?"  I asked. 

Dorian turned on his bar stool to face me.  Our legs were staggered and I couldn't help the shiver than ran through my body.  I looked down at how we sat and Dorian chuckled.  "I still find it amazing that I can make a very bold and very outgoing young man quake because of something I did."

I looked up at him and smiled.  "You didn't always have this affect on me."

"I know."  Dorian looked away and took a sip of water.  It was the real problem.  The fact that he watched me grow up, had a hand in it.  "I made a decision after the night we spent together.  You holding me in my time of loss.  You never once took advantage of things even though I know you wanted to.  You wanted more even then.  I know you too well Nox.  I know that more for you is not just sex because you don't want more with people.  You push them away, you always have.  I was afraid that my attraction to you would cause problems in my life."

Dorian sighed.  "After you healed my wounds and saved my life then you were in a coma for over a month I had a lot of time to think about what it all meant.  I had decided that if you lived I would give it a shot.  I stopped by everyday after that hoping and praying you'd survive.  I hadn't realized at first that you slept better in my presence until the day one of the nurses stopped me in the hall and we were standing outside for a good 30 minutes and I watched as you were in pain and suffereing, but when I walked in you calmed down and slept."

Dorian took a deep breath.  "And then you woke up and professed your feelings.  Told me how I had saved you and I panicked."

"So I scared you away?"

Dorian nodded.  "Margo's brilliant plan to make us work together helped.  I'm glad she meddled."

I laughed.  "I don't think she was specifically meddling for you and I.  But I'm glad she did too."  I smiled at Dorian.  "While we are confessing things, I need to tell you something.  I'm not only going slow for you."

Dorian said, "I know."

"Do you now?"  I grinned at him.  "I never had a relationship, Dorian. This whole dating and emotional connection thing I've never done.  My longest relationship ever has been with Jason and he's my best friend so it's not quite the same.  Every other person I was with was temporary - a fling at best, a one-night-stand was typical."

Dorian nodded.  "I know.  I know why you want to go slow.  You are afraid as much as I am."

"I guess I am."  I grabbed Dorian's shirt and pulled him closer then leaned in and kissed him softly.  The kiss grew more passionate but it was awkward as we sat on the bar stools.  

Dorian pulled away first with a breathless smile. "We will have to do more of this.  But tonight I have plans with my family."

I grinned at him.  "That's alright.  I think we can spend time apart."

"Thank you for lunch."  Dorian stood up between the two stools and his body was that much closer to mine.  He looked down at me and my body screamed at me to meet his.  "I should go before slow is no longer slow."

I laughed.  "Probably a good idea."  

Dorian stepped away from the bar and I followed him to the door.  We exchanged another kiss before he walked out.  We didn't say anything.  We knew where we stood now.  I felt lighter.
