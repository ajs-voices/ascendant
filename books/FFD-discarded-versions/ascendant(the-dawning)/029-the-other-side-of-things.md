# The Other Side of Things
_Monday, July 20, 2015 2:00 PM_

I took my time going down to the Academy levels to where I was to meet Dorian for this test of a kid who'd sparked.  I had read the file earlier but I'm not exactly sure what I was here to do much less what I should be doing.  I knocked on Dorian's door and he called for me to enter.  I was happy to hear his voice.  I was even more so when I saw him sitting at his desk toiling away at his job.  I stood in the door way watching him.  

He didn't look up and waved for me to sit.  "You are making me nervous.  Sit."

I grinned and did as I was asked, he still hadn't looked up at me.  I wondered if he knew who was here.  I continued to watch Dorian and when he looked up to see who was sitting he had a slight frown before it turned to a smile.  "I don't know why I am surprised you just come in unannounced waiting for me to say something."

My grin widened.  "I enjoyed watching you and I wanted to see how long it too you to notice it was me."  

Dorian rolled his eyes at me and stood up as he looked at his watch.  "It's about time.  Shall we?"

"But of course."  I stood up and followed Dorian out of his office closing the door behind me.  

He grinned at me.  "I would have had to ask others."

I shrugged.  "Habit I guess.  I am ususally following you places."

Dorian laughed softly.  "Well you aren't following me right now."  He leaned over and whispered.  "I could hold your hand but..."  He trailed off with a smile and I laughed.

"I am almost a bad influence on you, Mr. Vega."

Dorian chuckled.  "Almost."

We walked in silence, but I couldn't help the smile that splayed over my face the whole time there.  Dorian asked, "You seem different as of late."

I grinned.  "I am."

Dorian smiled as he opened the door to the testing room.  "He's not here yet.  Come on in."

I sat down in a chair I'd never sat in before; it was far mroe comfortable than the one on the opposite side.  I smiled at Dorian.  "Never knew how nice it was in here when my nerves weren't making me insane."

Dorian laughed.  "It is an adjustment to make sitting on this side of the table.  I remember the first time I did it.  I was here in much the same capacity as you are now."

I might as well tell Dorian now.  Or at least start the conversation.  "I spoke to Anabel before I came down here."

Dorian turned to me with a shocked look on his face.  "What did you do, Nox?"  His voice was quiet and white hot and it was all I could do to not cringe out of fear.  I disliked his angry voice.

But, I gave him a grin that said he was not going to like it.  He dropped his gaze into that I will have your head.  "Did you tell Anabel to back off?"

I shook my head.  "Not exactly.  I gave her an alternative."

Dorian blinked and I continued in a whisper.  "I'll give her potential Cesari in exchange for leaving you be."

Dorian frowned.  "Nox.  I have an obligation."

"I know Dorian. We'll figure that out.  Do you _want_ to have sex with Anabel?"

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  But that's not the point."

"Yes Dorian, it's exactly the point.  You are forcing yourself to be with this person because it's your duty - your obligation.  You shouldn't have to.  We'll figure something out.  But I will give Anabel what she wants and you and I can deal with the other part of it."

Dorian still looked angry.  "You really think there is another option?"

I nodded.  "Yeah I do.  We'll find it.  I promise."

Dorian sighed and took my hand.  "Nox, you shouldn't have done that.  But thank you."

I nodded as the door to the room opened and Dorian dropped my hand and stood up.  A small little boy holding a stuffed parrot walked into the testing room.  I stayed seated as Dorian greeted the little boy.  Dorian looked outside the door.  "Where are your parents?"

The little boy shrugged.  I had a bad feeling about the parents.  Who leaves a 5 year old with a stranger for testing?  Dorian glanced back at me with a frown.  I smiled at him and the little boy.  Dorian walked him over and sat him down in the uncomfortable chair.  "Ryan, this is Nox.  He's going to help me with your test alright?"

He nodded and I stuck my hand out to the little boy.  "Hi Ryan."  He smiled at me.  "What are your parents mad at?"  I asked to try to get the boy talking.

He shrugged.  "It was only a little fire."

I nodded.  "I set the curtains on fire when it happened to me."

The boy sat up straighter in his chair and looked at me.  "Did you hurt anyone?"

I shook my head.  "Did you?"

The boy looked down and I said.  "You didn't mean it.  Are they alright?"

The boy lifted his head slightly and looked at me from under his hair and hooded eyes and nodded.  "Mommy didn't get burned.  It was just hot."

I nodded.  "She was holding it?"  It didn't matter what it was only that his mother had been holding it."

"It was not fair.  My sister got to have one."

I grinned.  "Anger is a big trigger for people like you and mean."  I leaned in and whispered.  "Some of my own teachers still spark like that when they get angry."  I sat back and smiled at Ryan.  "We'll teach you how to control it.   You'll not hurt anyone like that again.  But we need to see whatelse we might need to teach you.  Can we do that now?"

The boy nodded and pulled his parrot closer to him.  I noticed Dorian watching us with curiousity.  I grinned at him.  "So how do you want to do this?"

Dorian smiled.  "Do you have an assessment?"  I had been watching his pattern as I spoke with him.  I was fairly sure he was going to be rated a NI3.

I nodded.  "Alright, let me do my testing and you watch and we'll see what if we agree."

"Okay."  I would sit and watch while Dorian did his thing.

Dorian pulled out the first box.  It was nothing more than a candle in a glass box.  The box wasn't needed but it insure that no one pulled the wool over the testers eyes and physically lit the candle.

Dorian asked Ryan, "Can you try to light the fire?"  He didn't provide any other instructions.  Not at first anyway.

Dorian waited for several moments before he assited Ryan.  He pulled a lighter from his pocket and light another candle outside.  "Can you see the flame on this one?"  The boy nodded, of course he saw it.  But Dorian was asking him really if he saw the pattern that created the flame.  Which was not likely.  Dorian intoned in a patient and encouraging voice, "Try to make it appear on the other one inside the box."

It was alot more complicated than that.  Dorian added, "You can hold the candle but not movie it."

The boy nodded and he grabbed the waxy part of the candle and thought about it. This was going to take forever.  I looked at Dorian and asked.  "Can I try something?"

Dorian waved his hand in front of him saying to be his guest.  I grinned at him and I moved to kneel behind the boy.  I blew out the candle and he looked up at me behind him.  "Watch me."

I wove a small tendril of fire above the candle outside the box.  "Look carefully.  Do you see the flash of red just before the flame ignites the wick?"

Ryan shook his head, and I blew the candle out.  "Watch carefully."

The boy nearly jumped with excitement, "I saw it.  I saw it."

I grinned at him and patted his shoulder.  "Can you try on the one inside the box."

He sat and stared at the candle and I watched as he pulled the fire around wick and it ignited.  The boy grinned and clapped his hands.

Dorian chuckled.  "Can we have you around for every test?"

I smiled.  "You can do it too."

Dorian shook his head.  "I can't."

I winked at him and blew him a kiss tehn mouthed, "We'll talk about it later."

He frowned but it was quickly replaced with a smile directed at Ryan.  "Shall we try different elements?"

Ryan nodded with excitement.  Hopefully he wouldn't be too dissapointed when he failed them.  I stayed where I was as Dorian pulled out a box of sand.  I used the sand inside the box and I lifted the sand into a column.  "See the brown light inside the sand?  We need to make the sand obey us, do soemthing sand doesn't usually do."

Ryan stared at the sand and shook his head.  "I don't see it."

I tried again, but he still didn't see it.  We tried several more times at Dorian's request and we got no where.

Dorian took the box of sand and hid it away again before he pulled out a box for testing air.  Dorian dipped the small ring in soap and slide it in place.  "Just blow a bubble like you would out here."  Dorian proceeded to blow a bubble with air from his mouth.

Dorian dipped the ring he held again in the bubble mixture again and I instructed, "This one is yellow, do you see the blue lights making the bubble."  I bend air through the soap and a bubble formed.  And again we continued for a total of five tries before Dorian was satisfied and moved on.

"The last was water", Dorian pulled out a bottle of water and the glass box for the test.  Dorian poured a little bit inside the box.  "Just like the sand."  

I showed Ryan what pattern to do as I spoke.  "This one is blue, it's slippery and slides all over the place as we work with it."  I repeated the waves in the box but Ryan never saw it.  

Dorian smiled as he put the box away.  "Very well done."  I patted the boy on the shoulder and sat back down in my chair.  "Your are indeed a Magnus.  The way I determine strength has been skewed by our friend here.  But I would guess a 3 in fire only."  I nodded.

Dorian nodded happily.  "Good.  Ryan.  I will take you down to the dormintory where your room is waiting for you.  Tomorrow if all goes well you will join others your age."

Dorian stood up and offered Ryan his hand.  "Nox.  Thank you.  We need to sit down and sketch out an ideal situation."

I grinned at him and nodded.  "Of course."  I pulled out my phone and glanced at the time.  "I'll start that now, I've still got an hour left of time down here with you."

Dorian nodded and left me to my own devices as he went and played mentor to yet another child.  A scary thought occurred as I sat back down.  _What if Ryan gets Garrett?_  My heart started to race and my thoughts went to places it did when Garrett came to mind.  I could see the past running through my mind.  I could feel the air and earth splay my skin.  I took a deep breath and started counting backwards with my control exercises.  And I still had to have dinner with him tonight.  My life sucked!
