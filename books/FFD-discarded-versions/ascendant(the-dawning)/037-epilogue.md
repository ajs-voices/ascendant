# Epilogue

The meeting wrapped up with only one thing truly confirmed.  Asher and his genetics team deemed me my own species they were tenatively calling me an Ascendant.  In other words rising in power or influence - you could call it that.

Asher said he would take my suggestion into consideration.  But from the way he spoke he didn't think it would get through the council.  It made me wonder if I could get away with more shit now though.  I was not truly Venatori - I mean I never really was to begin with.  But now I **was** something different.  Funny thing though I didn't feel any different.

I was still fucking terrified to see Garrett again.  So I did what any good coward does.  I slipped the paper full of the information Garrett wanted under his door after taking a photo copy of it and stashing it someplace safe in my apartment.  And I took a picture of it with my phone and stashed it someplace no one would think to look for the file on it.

By the time lunch rolled I realized that meeting went much longer than anticipated and I had completely blown off my class.  Fuck!  I was lying on my bed when I heard the door.  When I answered it I wasn't overly surprised to see Dorian smiling back at me with a paper bag of food and a Congratulations! balloon hovering over his head.

I laughed as I let him in.  "God, I love you."

Dorian grinned at me and kissed my cheek, brushing his lips against my ear.  "I love you too."  And he walked past me and into the kitchen to prep whatever he brought for lunch.  And I was more than ready for some down time and who better to spend it with than with the man who I had fallen for.
