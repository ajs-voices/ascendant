# New Schedule
_Monday, July 20, 2015 8:00 AM_

The rest of the night was quiet but I couldn't get Garrett off my mind, even with a four year old to distract me until he went to sleep.  My night was atypical as had been happening since I'd woken up from the coma.  I was up before 4, showered and had my own breakfast long before Drake was ever roused from sleep at 7am.  And I'd had already sent Dae'lin an email with information on one of the cases she'd sent me.  I was a glorified researcher for her right now.  It was things that others could do they just choose not to do it themselves.  I tried not to dwell on it.  But I could see a billion things to change, but tradition was tradition and it will always be like this.

I had Drake in class by 8am we were almost late but I managed it on time.  Drake kept stalling.  As I was leaving Henry was just arriving at class.  He looked up at me and frowned.  "Not teaching today?"

I grinned down at him.  "10am, I'll be there.  I have an appointment I must keep."

Henry smiled.  "Okay."  His father looked at me with a quizical look as  Henry hugged my legs and ran off into his classroom.  I recognized his father, he was a year or two ahead of me in the Academy and we had Chemistry together - such fond memories of atoms and chemicals.

He shook his head.  "I've never seen him take to someone so quickly."

I grinned, "It's the age difference.  There isn't much of it."  The man laughed at my joke as I held out my hand.  "Nox SÃ©tanta."

He took my hand and shook firmly.  "Eric Eskridge.  I remember you.  Chemistry, right?  You aced it which surprised everyone."

I laughed.  "It was patterns, something I've recently come to understand is my so-called ability as a Venatori.  It's not puzzles, it's seeing complex patterns easily."

Eric nodded.  "It makes more sense.  At least your ability is useful.  Being fluent in languages is only good when you have others around who don't speak your language."

"I'm sure I could find a use for it actually.  Considering I'll be teaching a child who can't hear or speak to me."  I was going to have to learn ASL.

He asked.  "You are speaking of Joey?"

I nodded.  "I will learn to do without a translator, but your ability would make that much easier."

Eric laughed.  "But then you wouldn't be in there teaching my son how not to set the apartment on fire."

"True.  He hasn't done that has he?"  I asked, I hadn't thought they'd done more than show signs that they were Magnus.

Henry's father shook his head emphatically, "Oh no.  No nothing like that.  We have no Magnus in our family.  He's the first and we are a little on edge about it."

"There is nothing to worry about.  By the end of the week he'll be beyond any point of worry.  I expect all five of them will have a grip on their ability so that nothing accidental happens."  I know it sounded egotistical, but I was fairly confident that these five children had full control of their abilities now.  The simple exercise we'd done yesterday had demonstarted that.  There would be no fire proof rooms for these children.  There would be no fear of family being repulsed by the accidents - even Venatori parents were leary of fire-starters.

There would be no fire-starters in this group.  

"I hope so."  He nodded to me and glanced in the door to find his son playing quietly with Drake.  "I have to get to work.  It was nice seeing you again."

I watched as the 3rd in line for the Eskridge rule headed for the elevators.  I would have an interesting time with his son.  An interesting time with all of them.  I was about to leave when I saw Aidan skipping around the corner.  He grinned madly and ran to me then wrapped his little arms around my legs.  I patted his head and looked up to find his mother staring back at me.  "Hey Stella."

"Hi Nox."  She herded Aidan towards the door.  "Class time, Aidan."  She ushered him through the door and turned to me.  "We will be seeing you and Drake tonight at Garrett's?"

I shivered at the thought.  I'd pushed it from my mind but now it sat unpleasantly at the forefront of my thoughts.  I simply nodded.  I didn't want to think of the horrible things Garrett could do to my family and friends unknowingly.  I survived him once, I could do it again.  I was stronger, wiser, I hoped, and I was not quite as naive as I had been when I came here.  I could get over this fear - it was no different than any other.  "Yeah.  Drake and I will be there."

Stella smiled.  "I'm glad.  How do you know Garrett?"

I swallowed hard, it was difficult to talk about.  "He was my fire-starter trainer."

"Oh!  So he really does know what he's doing with Aidan?"  She sounded enthusastic.

"Yes." It was the truth.  He had taught me and many others before and after me.  "Though I was pulled from his teaching before I finished my training."  I added.

Stella started for the elevators and I followed her.  "Why?"

I shook my head.  "That's a long story.  But there was an accident, it wasn't safe for me to be around Garrett any longer."

"An accident?"  She wasn't going to let it drop.

I stopped in the middle of the hall and looked at the small little red-head.  "I set him on fire with a spark."

Stella's mouth formed a little o and she stepped forward.  "It was an accident I'm sure.  You were still training."

I only nodded.  Both Garrett and I knew the full truth of the matter.  It was not an accident.  I had finished my training and had full control of my ability.  I set the man on fire, on purpose for malicious reasons.  I was six years old and he'd beaten me and I repaid the favor in the only manner I could get away with.

Stella pushed the button on the elevator.  "Garrett makes you jumpy?"

I shrugged.  "Old habits."

Stella pulled my chin down to her level and scolded me with her other index finger, "You are not his student anymore.  Get over it."  She let go and laughed, "At least that's what I'd tell you if you were my son."

I laughed.  "My parents didn't give a shit about me back then."  I turned towards the stairs.  "I'll see you later.  I have an appointment to keep."

Stella nodded, "I'll see you later then, Nox."  Her voice sounded sad and I can only imagine it was because of what I'd just said.  It was the truth.  I wasn't looking for pity.

I still had time before my appointment with Margo but I went up to her office anyway and waited until she called me into her office.  The waiting room was familiar and I enjoyed the soft scent of apples as I relaxed against the back of the couch.  Megan typed away, doing whatever it was she did when not answering phones.  I could have asked, but it really didn't matter one way or the other really.

A man with whispy hair left Margo's office with a nod to Megan.  I watched as he left, he hadn't been here the last time I'd come in for my appointment.

I turned back to Margo and she waved me inside.  I stood up and stretched my long limbs before walking into her office.  I caught the underlying perfume of apple blossoms on Margo before I sat down in my usual spot.  Margo took her place in the chair opposite me with a smile.  "How fares the young Mr. Nox?"

I grinned at her.  "Dealing."  She raised a questioning eyebrow.  "Things change on a daily basis."  I added.  "Dorian is confusing, yet I think we want some of the same things."

Margo sat and listened while I continued on.  "I keep running into Garrett, and now I have dinner with him and Stella this evening."

Margo's mouth formed a small o.  "Really?  How does that make you feel?"

I leaned forward and looked squarly at Margo.  "I am fucking scared and I have no choice.  My body starts shaking at the thought of being in the same room as him.  There were implied threats and he explicately told me not to bring Dorian calling him 'your precious Dorian'.  And that alone bothers me.  How does he know that I have feelings for Dorian?  Dorian and I are not exactly in the place publicly, even in my own apartment that Garrett should know that."

I sighed and sat back in the couch violently.  I was upset with myself, with the fact that Garrett scared me so much.  "I will conquer this fear.  I just don't know how.  He paralyzes me with a mere glance."

Margo nodded and jotted down a few notes.  "Do you think this has any bearing on your dreams as of late?  You look exhausted."

"Yes.  But since waking up my dreams have been screwy.  And not it's not just me that's getting hurt in my dreams.  The demons go after everyone I care about - Drake, Aidan, Dorian.  All those that mean something to me."  I raked my hands through my hair.

Margo patted my knee.  "This is the first time in your life that you have more than yourself to care about."  She said it like it should be obvious to me, and it was correct. I had never had someone care about me or someone to care for until now.  It made sense.  

"So it's my fears manifesting.  But why are **my** demons hurting them?  I was dreaming about them before I'd seen Garrett and he made his threats."  I was confused.  I could understand them being part of my nightmares, but that one fact made everything skew again.

"I'm going to beat this.  Tonight when I see him, I won't freeze."  It was a promise I was making myself.  Tonight under no circumstances would I allow Garrett to incapacitate my physical being.  It was going to take all my strength to get through that one dinner.  

Margo smiled at me.  "Sometimes, Nox, I wonder why you even still come here.  You don't need me.  You just need someone to listen to you.  I know we've been doing this for a long time, and it's part of your routine.  But I'd like to try to schedule you to every other week."

I could feel a small ache of panic setting in but I nodded.  "I will try."  It was all I could do.  I expected anxiety to ratchet up next Monday when I didn't come see Margo.  

She nodded and got up from her seat.  I followed suit and started for the door, but Margo interrupted my progress, "Just a moment, Nox.  I have something for you."

I stopped and turned around as she pulled a small bundle from her desk drawer as she continued.  "I know scents play a large part in your comfort level.  To help ease your transition I had Megan pick you up the scents we use in the waiting room and in my office."  She handed me the little bundle.  "I ask that you only use them in your alloted Monday slots.  It's meant to transition you, not comfort you at all times."

I took the package and smiled at Margo.  "Thanks."  I wrapped my arms around her shoulders and hugged her tightly.  I felt like we were saying good-bye.  And in a way we were, it was just going to be a very slow good-bye.  I could feel the anxiety well up as my thoughts continued along that path.  I pulled away.  I grinned playfully at her, "This has nothing to do with my father does it?"

Margo laughed.  "No.  It has been something I've been considering for a few years now."

I smiled.  "Alright.  As long as Kai had no part in the decision I'll work on it.  Thank you.  I think this will help."

Margo nodded and opened the door for me.  I stepped out before her and she followed me to Megan's desk.  She told her assistant, "Schedule Nox for two weeks from today - same time."

Megan looked up at me with a smile.  "This is a big step.  I'm proud of you."

I laughed, "We'll see how next week goes before you start offering congradulations."

Megan laughed.  "I've modified your appointments to reflect the new schedule, and your personal calendar should update accordingly."

I took a deep breath and nodded.   "Thanks."  I could hear my own nervousness in that one word.  I headed for the door and down stairs to give my first class.
