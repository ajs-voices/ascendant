# What Am I Doing?
_Tuesday, July 21, 2015 8:30 AM_

I headed to my father's apartment which was around the corner too.  I was amazed at how much all our status' were alike and yet they were completely different.  My father could be better off if he got married, or if he still had kids.  Dorian was still young and single and unmarried and should be several levels lower but his prestige was that great.  Me, I had a kid while not by design, and I had better digs than either of them, but still the same level.  The Venatori life was so unfair.  I was beginning to see why Stella was having issues.  But there was little I could do and if I thought about it, there is little I would change in anything other than our justice system.  It was the only thing unfair to me.  

I knocked on my dad's door and didn't get an anser.  I didn't really expect my father or Drake to be awake or to even answer the door.  I pulled my key out of my pocket.  I had a grand total of three keys.  Mine, my father's and the key to a lock in a storage bin where my things over the years have been stored.  I didn't even know what was in there anymore.

I unlocked the door and flipped on the light in the kitchen and started a pot of coffee and then plated the fritattas for the sleepy heads.  I found Drake in bed with my father.  I shook the little dragon awake and he opened his eyes and grinned at me.  He whispered, "Hi."

I grinned.  "Hey little man.  You ready to clean up?"  My father was keeping clothes for Drake here too.  He was being a true grandparent.  I smiled as my father grumbled.  I spoke up, "Coffee's on."

He rolled away from me and hurmphed.  I picked up Drake and helped him get undressed before he rushed into Kai's bathroom.  He didn't have a tub which means I was going to get soaked.  Drake giggled as I pulled my shirt over my head.   When I turned around to find a towel under the sink Drake let out a soft shriek as he ran his tiny hands over my back.  I froze underneath his careful touch.  I could feel my breathing increasing and my blood pressure rising.  He wrapped his little arms around my neck, his small chest pressed against my back as he hugged me tight.  He didn't know what had happened to me.  I had no intentions of telling him, at least not anytime soon.  And thankfully Drake didn't ask. He just hugged me.  I pulled the little dragon around me into my arms with a smile.  "You ready for a shower?"

Drake giggled again and stepped into the shower.  One thing I'd learned about my little one was he actually enjoyed the cold part of the shower.  I didn't think it was a good idea to clean in completely cold water, it was mid summer but still I didn't want to start things now before winter hit.  

We carefully washed Drake's little head and washed him up and he was snuggled up in my arms in a brown fluffy towel as we walked out of the bathroom to find Kai glaring at me.  "You had to make coffee."

I grinned at him.  "I heard that this morning."

He asked, "Dorian?"

I shook my head.  "No.  Todd."

Kai's face paled and I sighed as I dried Drake off and helped him pull on his clothes.  H efushed at me pushing my hand away when I tried to help him he only wanted to hold on to me, nothing more help.  I looked at Kai and knew he'd known.  "Why didn't anyone say anything to me?"

My father shook his head.  "Out of sight, out of mind?  I honestly hadn't thought about the young man until you mentioned him.  He and Dorian are just friends no matter their relationship.  Just one up on you and Jason."

I nodded.  "Todd and I had a long talk after Dorian and I talked last night."

Kai frowned.  "You two were cozy last night.  I'm sorry."

I shrugged.  "I'm comfortable enough in my self and in what I think Dorian and I have to say it's alright.  Todd seems to be a nice enough guy.  Hot as hell but not exactly sure I can compete with that and their history.  But we'll see."

Kai patted my back.  "I don't think I will ever get used to the idea that two of my boys think men are hot."

I laughed.  "Do you want to go women watching, Dad?  We can go dancing, chat up a few girls and then go home."  I grinned at him, "To our significant others and see how good we got it."

Kai laughed.  "You know boy that sounds like a damned sweet idea.  But not really my thing."

I rolled my eyes.  "It doesn't seem to be anyone's thing."

Drake dropped down to his rear and bounced off the bed and scurried into the living room and to the kitchen.  He knew the drill already.  I looked to my father, "I brought you breakfast too."

Kai nodded.  "I saw, I already ate mine."

I grinned.  "Good."

We chatted a little about his vampire case - he was still hunting the Bernstein vampire.  He was having no luck finding him and the killings were only getting worse.  I asked, "Are you sure it's Berstein?  And not someone trying to frame him?"

Kai laughed, "Why on gods-green-earth would anyone want to frame the most powerful vampire?"

I shook my head.  "I don't know.  Just a hunch.  You tell Dae'lin your struggles."

Kai shook his head.  "No, why?"

I have a similar case she's having me look at.  "Vampire kills but there is something off about it.  Don't look like any vampire attack I've ever seen."

Kai tapped his finger to his lips and I could see gears turning, I'd say smoke was coming out of his ears, but he'd just swatt me.  He finally spoke.  "We'll have to sit down and compare notes."

I nodded.  "I've an appointment with Dr. Eriksen in the Infirmary - follow up on my lovely condition after I drop off Drake.  And a 2 to 4 appointment in the Academy standing.  And picking up Drake after that.  Any other time I'm free.  Tomorrow is pretty much the same except the appointment with Dr. Eriksen.  Oh yeah, and my 10 to noon class.  Oops can't forget that.  Drake would be devistated if I got fired from that."

Kai laughed.  "He is excited you are teaching him in school.  He asked me if I thought he could call you Daddy.  I told him he'd have to ask you."

I was surprised.  I'm hardly a father figure.  

Kai shook his head.  "Nox, you are a better father figure than a many men.  And that boy adores you.  When he got here he was quite and shy and didn't have friends.  The day you were to take him home though things all changed.  He perked up and is the boy you see now."

I smiled.  "I'm glad.  But I got to get him moving now.  Class and appointment then more class."

Kai noded.  "Yeah.  I'll get with Emilio and we'll find a convient time with you."

"Sounds good."  I followed the little dragon out into the living room and kitchen.  Drake as putting his sink in the sink and was getting his backpack on and looking for me.  "You ready, Drake?"

He nodded.  "Yep."

I knelt down in front of him.  "Kai tells me that you asked him if you thought I'd let you call me Daddy?"

He looked down and nodded. I put my hand under his chin and lifted it to look up at me.  "Drake, you can call me whatever you want.  With in reason of course, I don't like some things."  I smiled at him.

He whispered, "Daddy."

I kissed to his forehead.  "That sounds good coming from your little mouth."

He wrapped his arms around me and he hugged me.  I stood up and carried him towards the door.  "See ya, Dad.  Let me know when is good for you."

Kai shouted from the other room.  "Right-o."

I dropped of Drake and didn't stick around to see any of the other parents.  I really didn't want to run into Garrett today.  I had things to do for him and I hadn't thought about what it really meant.  I mean I'd lied to Dorian in a way, it wasn't illegal but it wasn't exactly legit either.  I had no idea what Garrett wanted that information for.

I had a few minutes and knew that my logins would be tracked.  But there were ways around that too.  And I'd learned a few over the years when trying to get others in trouble or when trying to do things I didn't have access for.  I had a few minutes.  I started for the Archives and felt a twinge of saddness as I remembered the a time not to long ago when I met Mrs. Vega there.

I found a computer and wondered where my laptop had come from - specifically because Jason broke mine.  I would have to ask Kai or Dorian if I remembered.  It wasn't exactly top of my mind these days.  The computer was logged in still, whatever idiot before me hadn't logged out.  A kid most likely and from what was on the screen it wasn't porn.  Which was a point in my favor, I didn't have to wade through it to do what I wanted to do under cover. 

The permissions were locked down and the permissions weren't great but Mark Green's schedule was public domain for most people.  He didn't hide his schedule.  He didn't want people thinking he was hiding things from them.  He was a good leader in that.  But like all of the Venatori before him, tradition ruled everything.  Tradition wasn't always what it was cracked up to be.

I don't know why Garrett couldn't do this himself.  It was a test I was sure.  He wanted to see if I would do it.

So I got it all down and written on to a peice of paper that I stuck in my pocket.  Now all I had to do was give it to him.  That was the hard part.  Maybe I should tell Dorian?  I don't know.  I really didn't want to get him involved in all this - just in case it all goes down horribly wrong.

But right now I had more pressing things on my mind - I had to go see the vile doctor that tried to kill me.
