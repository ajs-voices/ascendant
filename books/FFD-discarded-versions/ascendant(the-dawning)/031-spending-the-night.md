# Spending the Night
_Monday, July 20, 2015 8:00 PM_

Drake's warm body curled up against me comforted me as I buried my face in his embrace while we rode the elevator up to our floor.  It wasn't really a long ride, but the glass elevator bothered me more than the height itself.   

Dorian was expecting me, at some point.  I wasn't sure I wanted to see him.  Or let him see me was more to the point.  Drake was clinging to me not for his safety but my own.  I only knew he was trying to comfort me from the soft humming he was doing in my ear like you do with a small child.  The one I'm supposed to take care of was comforting me - not exactly parent of the year.

I found myself in front of Dorian's door without a second thought.  I knocked and Drake hummed in my ear.  I smiled when I finally realized he was singing what I thought was "This Old Man" but his words didn't match the tune.  I shook my head, he was singing Barney the Dinosaur's "I Love You" song.  How times had changed.

I knocked on the door and held Drake close.  I wasn't exactly neverous but I felt a little awkward in my current mental state and I didn't want to be a burden.  I was already worried he was going to tire of me.  I heard voices on the other side and I could tell Dorian was coming to the door.  I put on a small smile and waited for Dorian to open it.  

Dorian opened the door with a soft chuckle from the other side.  He turned and his smile widened.  "Hey you.  I wasn't sure when you'd be done."

I leaned in and kissed him softly.  

A familiar voice yelled from the living room.  "Get a room."

Dorian reddened. I pulled back and smiled.  "My dad is here?"

Dorian nodded.  "He wanted to share something with me.  My father is here as well."

"I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company."

Dorian smiled.  "It's alright."  He put his arm around my waist and walked me inside.  

I whispered as we walked past the kitchen.  "Does my father know where I was?"

Dorian shook his head with a grin.  "I didn't tell him."

Drake squrimed down out of my arms when he saw Kai sitting in the square grey arm chair that adorned Dorian's living room.  The little dragon ran to him and jumped into his arms.  "Poppi.  Nox is my teacher and my new daddy!"  Drake wrapped his arms around Kai's neck and Kai returned the hug.  

"I know."  He pulled him away and gave him a stern look.  "Are you being good for him?"

Drake nodded emphatically.  "Yes, sir.  Especially at home."

Kai laughed.  "Good lad."

I sat down next to Dorian on the counch his father sat the other side of him, reclinging like it was his own living room watching Kai and his grandson.  Dorian left his arm around me and I leaned into him hopefully looking casual.  Kai and Drake were easily chatting away.  Emilio turned to us with a smile.  "So son, does that sound like a good deal?"

I lifted my gaze.  Emilio laughed softly.  "Why don't you inform your...."  Emilio looked at me with a wicked smile.  "Why don't you tell Nox what Kai is offering you?"

I winked at Emilio and he blushed.  If he wanted to play games I was more than happy to play them too.  I layed my head on Dorian's shoulder, "So what news do you have?"  I grinned playfully at him.

He rolled his eyes but he let me stay where I was and I was more than happy to be this close to him.  "Your father upon hearing about my new situation with Anabel via my father had a solution to my problem."

I sat up and leaned my elbows on my knees and looked back at Dorian grinning.  "What I tell you things work out."  I turned to my father sitting in the chair with Drake and sighed, they were involved and while that was a good thing I didn't get to hear it from my father.  "So tell me what's the proposal?"

Kai heard my question and laughed.  "As Dorian knows, my daughter, your sister, was having issues conceiving her children.  They went through everything and in order to complete their obligations they had to result to IVF."  Kai looked at me with a grin.  I smiled back at against the back of the chair and put my arm around Dorian's shoulder.  "So Iris is donating an egg?"

Kai nodded and I grinned from ear to ear.  "So no sex for Dorian.  With a womany anyway."  

I looked over and saw Dorian was a slight reddish color under that burnished skin of his and I kissed his cheek.  "Like they don't know what we do behind close doors."  The red color deepened even though it was currently a lie.  Dorian and I still hadn't had sex.  But it was fun to poke a little embarassement at my father and Dorian's.  Though they only chuckled, it was only Dorian who was embarrassed.  I leaned in and whispered, "I'm sorry."

Dorian reached his hand across my knee and patted it.  He was okay with the comment despite the blushing.  The fact that he was touching me in a much more intimate way than he had before made me flush.  

Kai laughed, "Whatever moment they are having Emilio, I think we should leave them to it."  He looked to Drake with a big grin.  "You want to spend the night with me?"

I looked over at Kai shooked.  I hadn't expected to be alone with Dorian tonight.  Thought I doubted things would get farther than before considering the night I'd had, and the talk that Dorian and I were likely to have when we were alone.  

Drake turned to me and asked, "Can I?"

"If you want to."  I answered.  I was more than happy to let them spend a little more quality time together.  He wasn't biologically my son, but Kai was taking his promise to heart.  He was being a better grandfather to my kids than he was a father to me.  Granted it wasn't even half his fault on that one.

Drake giggled.  "Yes please, Poppi."

I grinned as Kai stood up.  "He's got class at 8am.  Do you want me to pick him up?"

Kai nodded.  "Probably want to get him feed too."

"Alright.  I'll be there at 7am."  Kai nodded again and he, Emilio and Drake headed for Dorian's door.  Emilio turned the latch as he closed it behind him.  Dorian and I were left in the solitude of his bachelor's pad cuddled up next to one another.  I don't know how long we sat there in silence, just absorbing one another.  

I entwined my long fingers with Dorian's with a smile breaking the silence.  "So how do you feel about being a father to a real live baby?"

Dorian laughed, "That's what you want to talk about?"  He sighed.  "I'm terrified.  It's not like I have a wife to help with things like my parents."

I sat forward and looked back at Dorian resting his head against the back of the couch.  "You aren't alone.  Your father and my father will help.  And if you want I will too.  Dorian, you don't have to do this alone.  Not at all."

Dorian chuckled.  "You going to move in and wake up with a baby at 3am for a feeding."

I grinned at him.  "If that's what you want me to do."

Dorian lifted his head and looked at me.  I could see the gears turning in his head he was trying to determine if I was serious or not.  "You really would, wouldn't you?"

I nodded.  "Dorian, no one should have the life I lived.  I will do all in my power to ensure my kids, your kids and anyone I care about doesn't live that life.  Being raised by the Venatori sucks.  No one deserves that."

Dorian shook his head.  "Changing the topic.  How was dinner?"

I sighed, it was my turn to be depressed.  "It went.  It's over.  Garrett threatened things if I don't do something for him."

"What did he ask you to do?"

I shrugged.  "I'd rather not involve you, Dorian.  Plausible deniability.  Please don't ask again.  I don't want to pull you down with me."

Dorian turned and took me by both shoulders and stared at me.  "If it's illegal Nox, don't do it.  We can protect them."

I shook my head.  "It's not illegal - per say.  And no you can't protect anyone from him.  I think he's been hiding something from the council."


Dorian asked, "What do you think he's hiding?"

"An ability.  I'm not 100% sure but it has to do with dreams.  He seems to know eactly what my dreams have been about my entire life.  I have a strange feeling about it all.  I don't think he has to hurt you physically to hurt you."  I carressed Dorian's cheek.  "I can't let him hurt you."

Dorian leaned his head against my hand and sighed softly.  "Be careful Nox."

I leaned forward and kissed Dorian.  My lips still so close as I pulled away just enough to whisper.  "I always am."

Dorian chuckled and I could feel my blood presure rise.  He was impossibly close.  I wanted so much more.  Dorian stood up breaking the moment.  He offered me his hand.  He looked dashing in his button down shirt, his tie was neatly undone sitting just underneath the top button that no longer held his collar closed.  I could see the beginning of his dark flames tattoo peaking out of the shirt.  I stood up and didn't take his hand.  I looked across at his sparkling blue eyes and reached to the second button on his shirt.  I was careful not to touch him as my fingers slipped the button from it's bindings.  

I let my fingers trail down to the next, and the next until there was only the buttons that were tucked into his pants.  Dorian looked across at me his eyes were now hot with lust.  We'd both been wanting this.  I pushed my hand into his shirt and was disappointed to find an undershirt beneath my fingers instead of Dorian's soft skin.  I looked up at him and he chuckled softly as he offered me his hand again.  

I took his hand and he turned and led me back through the hall into his blue bedroom.  The sheer change in atmosphere seemed to spark more enthusaim from Dorian.  Once the door was closed he had me up against the door and was kissing me with more passion than I had seen from him ever.  My body tightened and I could feel the blood rushing from everywhere to my ever increasing hardon. 

I tried to pull Dorian's shirts from his pants but Dorian took my hands and held them above my head as he pressed me into the wall.  A small moan escaped my mouth as I heard the fucking door.  

It was a small rapping.  Followed by a little more enthusastic assuming Dorian was not near by.  Dorian's phone chimed in the other room and he pulled away from me.  "Fuck!"

I looked across at Dorian.  He sighed.  "I need to get the door.  When you are presentable, you can come on out."

Dorian straighted himself but he didn't button his shirt up.  I moved away from the door and Dorian left to go answer it.  "Fuck was right."  

I took a deep breath and stealed myself for whatever made Dorian swear.
