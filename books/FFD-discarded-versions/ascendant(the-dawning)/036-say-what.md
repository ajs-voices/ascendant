# Say What?

Amara Eriksen I've heard is nothing like her brother Asher.  While they are both brilliant, Amara was said to be warm and caring.  If the woman who tried to kill me was warm and caring I would hate to see her brother.

The four doctors and myself sat down in the small infirmary medical room.  I didn't understand a damned thing most of them were saying at first.  Amara was regailing them with my recovery process which while I didn't understand the medical terms I found intriquing and honestly I'd have liked to get Dorian's take on it.  And me being me I had to interrupt.  "You don't know what was going on while I was in a coma.  Only that each test got progressively better?"

She nodded and I looked at Dorian.  "What did you see when you came to visit?"

Dorian looked at me confused.  "I already told you what I saw."

I nodded.  "But did you tell them."  I pointed to the other three?

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  I'm not a doctor."

"This has nothing at all to do with medicine, and everything to do with magic.  Shouldn't the only person in her qualified to explain some of the unexplained tell someone who thinks it's a "medical" miracle that I'm alive what they saw?"

Dorian grinned playfully at me.  "You can do better than that?"  

I laughed.  "You seriously want me to show them.  If I cut myself Dorian, the nice lady doctor here will see that I'm admitted again.  All part and parcle to the whole genie gig."  I lifted my pant leg to reveal the ankle monitor that was so innocently hiding.

Dorian nodded.  "I'll do it then."

"You really want me to show them?"  I asked again.

"I think it will speak louder than my words or yours combined.  One on each arm, you do one and let nature take on the other?"  Dorian was going all scientific on me and he made me smile.  

I nodded.  "Alright."  Dorian got up and looked in a few of the drawers before he found a scalple.  He rinsed it off.  "Don't cut too deep, I don't want a scar."  I beamed at him.

Dorian snickered as he drew the blade across my forearm.  It stung and I let it start the healing process.  "I won't touch this one."  I could feel the blood welling and sliding down my arm.  It was deeper than I'd have liked.  Dorian switched to the other side and slit my forearm again.  "I'll do what I do here."  I feed all the elements into the wound and as the blood started to well up and over the wound it was completely closed, while the first one was dripping on the floor.  "I feed my natural ability to heal resources, and it does it's job faster.  It's like giving an ant an endless supply of food.  He no longer has to fetch it, just put it away."

Dorian wiped the blood from my healed arm and there wasn't even a scratch.  He did the same to the other and the cut was still weeping blood, it ooked red around the edges and was healing slowly and would be completely healed in about 30 minutes.  It was proof enough of what I could do.

I healed my other arm and Dorian cleaned up the floor with the paper towel he'd used on me earlier.  "I don't think it would work quickly with a human or other non-regentative race."

The Todd and Amara had their heads together and were whispering.

Todd looked up at me.  "Be honest with us, yeah?"

"I don't typically lie to begin with."  I conceeded.

Todd nodded.  "Have you ever been bitten by a werewolf?"

I shook my head.  "Closest I've come is a scratch by a werebear."  I lifted my shirt and showed him the three claw marks running across my chest and stomach.

He whistled softly.  "But not bitten?"

I shook my head again.  "Nope."

"Your mom or dad?"  He asked.

"I don't know.  My mom's family was wiped out by a werewolf which is why she was with the Venatori to begin with."  I really had no idea.

Dorian sat down at a computer across the way and started flipping through records.  He was quickly in the right place and reading the medical report.  "She was bitten, but since she never turned the assumption was it was their pet dog who bit her."

Todd started whispereing again with Amara.  I was getting fed up with it.  "At least share with the class."

Todd looked up with a sour grin.  "I didn't want to scare you."

"Scare me?  Doubtful."  I didn't scare that easily.  My fears were pretty well known to me - heights, needles, the occassional clown, but that was about it.

Todd nodded.  "Alright.  Remember those charts I showed you?"  I nodded.  Todd threw up an image on the screen.  I loved technology.  He drew on his computer. He circled an area on the chart.  "This is typically where we find lycanthropy in a human specimen."  

He over laid an image on top of that.  Another chart and he circled an area on here.  "Here is where typically we find the unique genetic markers of Magnus in a Venatori."  He put up another chart.  "This is dragon DNA.  As we expected we see genetic markers of a Dragon in a Cesari."  

Todd laid out a third image.  "This is a human with vampirism.  Here you see the genetic markers."

I was getting the point.  "Wait, the one I circled, that's me?"

Todd nodded.  "Yes."  He dropped a fourth image on top.  "Typical Venatori DNA."  And a fifth.  "You."

In a red marker Todd started drawing circles.  "As you can see you have human genetic markes, which override some of the key elements of the Venatori.  You know your limitations better than anyone, it's likely caused from these abnormalities."  He made another circle.  "Typically we only see Cesari here.  But you span many more genetic markers with dragons than any other Cesari we've tested."  He looked past his computer monitor.  "And since finding this we've tested nearly two dozen Cesari world wide - none hit where you do."

I was seeing a very bad line up, but I let Todd continue.  "I'm sure you've noticed by now.  You have genetic markers for both vampirism and lycantrhopy yet you are not dead, nor have you turned.  It's possible to carry vampirism till your death as a human, but as a Venatori you should be dead from both.  And they do not coexist in one host one would kill the other off."

Todd laid down a sixth image.  "Here's the real kicker.  This is Aeternus DNA from an old sample on file."

I stared at it watching yet another section line up.  "Fuck!" was my only response.  Everyone was just looking at me.  Dorian was shaking his head with a smile on his face.  I couldn't even begin to know what he was thinking.  "So you are saying, that I am like some puzzle peice that's been thrown together and we get this."

The door opened and another blond hair blue eyed man walked in.  Except this time everyone stood up.  When Asher Eriksen walked in the room you knew power, you could almost feel it in the air.  He looked at me.  "Well, well.  I didn't expect you to include him in all this, Sister."

Amara looked abashed as she sat back down indicating for her brother to sit as well.  "Asher.  He identified the patterns in his own DNA when Dr. Ingram showed him a sample of his report.  He is well known for his ability to ferret out the patterns in things.  I didn't figure it could hurt."

Asher sighed and waved his hand.  "So, boy.  What's it feel like to be your own species?"

"What?"  The idea that I was unique was not beyond me.

Asher smiled.  "I said.  What does it feel like to be your own species?"

"I heard you the first time.  I'm that messed up I warrant my own species?"

Asher laughed.  "It is not the first time.  The Venatori were created from mixing Venatori with human and other species and once the differences surpassed the original a new one was named after the original task they preformed."

I frowned.  Asher laughed again.  I could hear the condesention in it and I wanted to hit him but I stayed in my seat and smiled at him which only made him laugh until he cried.  "Let us discuss the difference between you and a Venatori then.  Then you will agree with my assessment of things."

Asher stood up.  "Your parentage is unique.  Your mother of human birth is a carrier of lycanthropy but had not turned at any time in her well lived life.  Your Magnus father has a unique ability even among the Venatori.  Four species at birth.  The possibilty of Aeternus DNA sequencing correctly is a very small probability - about on par with your birth as it was.  Most minorem don't survive wereattacks, or vampire ones, yet you've done so.  But the disease modified your DNA.  If we throw in werebear I'm sure we'd find a few manipulations there as well."

"Your DNA is a patchwork of too many races and it looks like a typical minorem would."  Asher finalized.

"Alright, let's say I agree.  But one doesn't constitute a new species."  I surmised.

The man smiled at me a perfect smile.  "Agreed.  Your children will tell the difference.  What DNA will they share, what is dominant versus resessive.  With one sample to go from we won't really have any clue."

I laughed.  "This is the reason I'm allowed to pick my mates?"

Asher nodded.  "Yes.  You were prolific enough as a child.  We figure you'd find mates easily enough."

I could easily kill two birds with one stone.  "When I was just Cesari - powerful but still only Cesari I was told there was going to be a line out the door for my progeny.  Why do you rely on the old fashioned method of things?  We implement IVF with couples who have issues conceiving and aren't being  mandated to breed with certain others.  If you want my DNA so badly to be spread out.  That's a no brainer.  And open it up to other Venatori if you insist on the two child per person thing.  People like Dorian and Nick who don't find women attractive could easily supply sperm.  Women like Dae'lin who wants to spend her life with a steralized minorem can't because she's not progenated yet.  I will gladly jack off into a cup for whatever time period you want to study the results with.  I choose my own mates.  I choose my own life partners but you get to see where the line goes."

Dorian chuckled to himself and Asher looked at him with wide eyes.  "What's funny, Dr. Vega?"

Dorian looked at me.  "I'd say you planned this, but this much attention is something you never want.  Fate is cruel to you, that's for sure.  Dr. Eriksen,  Nox has a very unique view on certain aspects of our lifestyle.  This plan of his fixes one of his issues."

"And that's funny why?"

Dorian laughed.  "It's not funny, sir.  I'm completely flabbergasted by the outcome of the situation.  He is as always improbable."
