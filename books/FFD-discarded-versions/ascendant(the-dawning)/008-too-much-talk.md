# Too Much Talk
_Thrusday, July 16, 2015 12:30 PM_

Lunch commenced with little interest.  Jo seemed to let the topic of Dorian drop which I was grateful for.  I didn't exactly want to talk about him with a complete stranger.  I mean I wasn't even keen on talking to Margo about it, but I knew I'd be talking with her and Dr. Wilton over the next half of my day.  I frowned.  This sucked.

Madison stopped by our table during lunch.  "Nox.  Dr. Eriksen stopped by while Dorian was with you.  She wants to speak with you this afternoon.  I hate to send you into so many sessions in a row, but I have my orders."

I nodded, "It's alright Madison, I'll deal.  It seems I'm far more popular now than I ever was in the Academy."

She grinned and patted my head, "You were an asshole then."

I laughed.  "I still am."

Pills were distributed and I had 30 minutes to kill before Margo showed up to interogate me.  Though it wasn't interogation when she did it, the hour following her was going to be hell though.  I wasn't looking forward to talking to Dr. Wilton.

I sat down on one of the common room couches and just watched things.  Watched the patterns around people and in some cases tried to figure out why there was a distinct lack of them on more than one patient.  Jo sat down next to me and leaned against me.  "You didn't seem surprised this morning."

I drapped my arm around her shoulder and she leaned against me further.  I found it distracting and comforting all at the same time.  I could smell the soft scent of forest from her hair and smiled, "You mean the imagery of the wolf?"

She nodded as I buried my nose in her hair on top of her head.  I spoke softly into her ear. "You're a werewolf.  I'd been trying to figure out your scent since I first met you."

Jo leaned forward and gave me a what-the-fuck look.  "I'm a what?"

That wasn't good, she didn't know what she was?  "Really?  How long have you been here?"

Jo sighed, "Two years."

"Seriously and no one's told you that before?"  I was dumbfounded.  How could anyone keep a werewolf from knowing what they were.  "How old are you?"  I knew it was improper to ask, but it was important.  Did infected humans of a young age not change on the full moon like a born were?  So many other questions started flooding my mind.

"I just turned 22." Jo's answer brought me from my thoughts.  I didn't know enough about werecreatures but I knew who did.  

"Happy belated birthday."  I grinned at her and she settled back against me.  "We are going to have to sit down and talk then.  But I need more information.  I know who to ask just need to get her on my visit list."

Jo shrugged, "Don't worry about it, Nox."

I wasn't going to drop it.  I'm not going to let this girl not know what she was.  It sucks not knowing what you are.  And I should know.  I am my biggest puzzle.

Lori came up behind us and put a hand on each of our shoulders, "Awe how cute.  A budding romance."

Jo pulled away from me and threw my arm from her shoulder.  "He's into men."

Lori looked at me like I was alien.  I grinned.  "I like women too.  She just saw me with someone of the same sex."

Lori laughed, "You mean that hot guy who interrupted yoga?"

I grinned, "Yes."  I put my arm back around Jo.  "But I'm not hitting on Jo."  I winked at Jo, "Unless she wants me to."

She growled at me and got up from the couch.  Lori jumped over the couch and sat in the seat Jo had vacated and leaned her head against my shoulder, "You're comfy."

I pulled her closer too, "That's a first.  Though Jace has been known to do this at times."

Lori laughed, "Your boyfriend?"

"No.  He's my bestfriend.  Nothing romantic with us.  Just friends."  Though that wasn't exactly what true, there was sex involved at times just not with each other.

"You are strange."  Lori said as she snuggled closer.

"You too little one."  She laughed.

Someone tapped me on the shoulder and I looked up to see Margo standing behind me.  I leaned over to Lori and whispered, "Shrink time, gotta go."

I stood up and nodded towards Margo.  She nodded, "Have fun."

Margo lead my to a small room, it was comfortable but sterile.  Everything here was sterile.  It was off putting.  Margo frowned at the room too.  "Hardly a comfort zone."

I shrugged.  "Feels like the whole place if you ask me."

Margo nodded.  "I'm sorry.  Making friends?"  She gestured to the chair opposite her.  

I sat down and leaned back, "For a change.  It's hard to be different among so many other different personalities."

"It's never stopped you before."  She smiled playfully.  "I watched you with the other girl too."

"Spying on me, Margo?"  I asked in playful banter.  "Jo is a werewolf.  She doesn't know what she is.  Can you get LouAnn Stricklen to come visit me?"

"Who is she?  And why?"  Margo opened up her little notebook and jotteded down the name.

"She's the werecreature instructor - a werewolf herself.  I have some questions."  

Margo raised an eyebrow, "Are you putting yourself in the helpful seat Nox?"

I grinned with a nod, "She doesn't know.  I don't think she's transistioned yet.  That could be dangerous in here."

Margo nodded, "I will see what I can do, but I'm sure everyone here is aware of her issues."

I nodded, "That might be the case, but I don't want to have to put down a friend."

"How was your first night?"  And so the topic came up, right off the bat.

"I didn't go to sleep at lights out, but I'm sure you expected that as no one hushed me or told me to go to bed.  And when I did go to sleep things changed.  It wasn't the same nightmare.  I remember fire this time, searing my skin instead of earth or air.  I started awake with 'I'm coming for you.'"  I sighed, "That's never happened to me before.  This place smells of nothing Margo.  Nothing.  There is no comfort anywhere.  Well not true.  Jo is the only thing that doesn't reek of nothingness."

Margo raised an eyebrow questioningly. I smiled, "The little wolf from before.   She smells of the underbelly of the forest.  Everyone else smells of the soap they provide - nothing but sterile clean."

"I don't think I can get that to change Nox."

"I know.  I need something.  I hate being empty.  I guarantee you Dorian's scent will linger forever in my room because there is nothing else there."  I sighed, "And that isn't going to help anything.  He came by today, we talked for a few hours."

"And?"  Margo prompted.

"There is no and.  It was all patterns.  I avoided him in every other fashion.  I can't do this Margo.  I can't want him, he doesn't want me."  I stood up and started pacing.  When did I pick up this habit?  I sat back down in a huff.  "I have to move on.  Get over the desire to want to make him happy.  Yet everytime I see him and he asks something of me I jump.  I'm not five or fifteen."  I was aggravated with myself more than anything Dorian did.  He was just being himself and I was falling harder each time he came around even though I was trying so hard not to.

"So what do you plan to do about it?"

I hung my head, "I don't know.  If he's not around I'm fine."

Margo nodded, "Think about what you need to do Nox.  Your goal in here is to present yourself as normal as possible. That means following instructions.  Not setting off anymore alarms.  Requesting weird things.  I would say social interactions but you seem to be making friends, and that is what I was most worried about." She stood up and sighed, "Sadly you've Dr. Wilton now."

I nodded.  "I'll behave.  I promise."

"Good lad."  She put her hand on my shoulder before leaving and letting Dr. Wilton in.  

"Mr. Sétanta.  How fares the day?"

I growled.  "The day fares well.  Leroy."

I saw Margo wince as the door closed behind her.  The man sighed.  "It's Dr Wilton."

"And I told you it was Nox."  I slumped in my chair and crossed my arms in front of me.  If he was going to be forgetful I wasn't going to be polite.

The elder man looked at me with fury in his eyes.  He wasn't used to me and my attitude, he'd get over it if he was going to work with me.  Or I was going to end up staying in her for a good long while.  One or the other and at this point I wasn't willing to cooperate with an inconsiderate prick.  "Mr. Sétanta.  How do you feel your mental health is?"

I leaned forward with a smile, "Well Leroy, today I feel like killing someone."  I could feel the anger rising inside and I saw the look of abject horror on his face - that I would even joke about it made this man worry.

I didn't think his pallor could getting any whiter, but he did, he whispered, "That's not even funny."

I leaned back in my chair with a grin, "I thought it was."

"Why would you feel this way today?"  Leroy continued on as if I'd said something perfectly  normal.  Did he really think I wanted to kill someone?  What in my profile says I'm a cold blooded killer?  It made me wonder what twisted files were out there on me.  I'd killed yes.  I'd maimed someone young, and it set presecence on my own feelings of brutatility.  I only killed in defense of myself.  Was I defensive because this man thought I was capable of murder?  What did I care what he thought?  Enough apparently, he was my ticket out of this joint.

I sighed, "I feel perfectly fine both mentally and physically.  I didn't eat well yesterday. I didn't go to bed on time and I didn't sleep well.  But overall I'm fine.  I had a lengthy conversation in a stressful situation and I've flirted with a few pretty girls today.  How are you?"  The last was bitter and snappy.  I hated being snappy but this man was the only thing stopping me from getting out of this place.

Leroy, that was what I was determined to call him.  It wasn't even his first name to my knowledge, but I didn't care.  He was fuming and I could almost see the smoke coming out of his ears.  The good doctor sat there staring at me, trying to figure out what to do, or what to say.  I wanted to get up and leave, but doing so would only make matters worse.  But I enjoyed making things worse and my inclinations got the better of me and I stood up and started for the door.

"Where are you going, Mr. Sétanta?"  He asked like I would answer.

I opened the door and I found that Dr. Wilton was indeed Venatori, he was at the door before I had it open a crack and was forcing the door closed with his small fragile looking little hand.

I grinned down at him.  "You really think you could stop me if I wanted to get out of here?"

He glared up at me and I saw the answer in his eyes.  If he were me, he'd be begging for me to try.  He thought he was better than me.  And with every step I made in character, every arragont word out of my mouth made him think that much less of me.  I knew the type.  I'd been dealing with Venatori arragoance my whole life.  I smiled down at him, "Move, or I'll move you."

"Sit down, Mr. Sétanta."  He was commanding.  His voice was like sandpaper on a chalkboard and my ire rose inside.  I could snap him like a twig if I wanted to - Venatori strength and speed or not.  I could stop his heart if I truly wanted to.  Death was an easy thing when you commanded the elements.

My thoughts grew darker as the man stood in front of me.  The darkness from my dreams started playing on my soul.  I took a step back from the door, but I didn't sit down.  What was going on?  I took another step back and stood in front of my chair.  Something was wrong.

And then I remembered what Bob had said about the darkness around me.  I sat down with an audible sigh of fustration.   Leroy watched me as I craddled my head in my hands.  I heard him come over and sit down in his chair, "What's wrong?  Something changed from the arragont boy to someone who's afraid."

I looked up at him.  "You honestly think I'm going to share with someone who insists on calling me by a name I do not like?  It's no different than calling me an asshole, or a bastard."

He frowned, "It is your name regardless of your like or dislike of it."

"Fine then, I'll just keep calling your Leroy."  I sighed and leaned back in my chair.  

"Nox, tell me what's wrong. That is why I am here."

I rolled my eyes, "You aren't here to fix me, or help me.  Your job is to make sure I'm unstable enough to remain here so Dr. Eriksen can study me to her hearts content and insure I'm at her beck and call."

"You really beleive that?"

"I know that."  I pulled my phone out of my hoodie pocket and pulled up my personnel file which included my psych profile.  I held it out to him. "No where in this document that says I am fit and healthy to be a Venatori agent does it say  - poses a risk to himself and others around him.  While it does mention the fact that I have a prederaliction for throwing myself from heights to conquer my fears.  It also says that I have a distinct disregard for authortative figures."  

"My capture record dictacts that I do not kill 80% of my marks and those 20% that have resulted in casualties have been in order to save my own personal life or that of other beings where caputre was impossible."  

"I hurled myself over the edge of the building to capture the bastard who nearly killed Nick, who did kill Mrs. Vega, who hurt my father, Dorian and Dorian's father.  I did everything in my power to save not only **my** life but the life of the kid I was trying to capture.  I had to increase my speed to catch him.  The moment I had him I tried to stop, but we were already 4 seconds into the 8 second drop and there was not enough time to slow down.  I did what I could before we crashed.  Not once has anybody asked me what the fuck happened."

Leroy just watched me.  He never once looked at the phone in my hand.  "I have read your record throughly, Mr. Sétanta.  I know what Dr. Silverman recommends.  I've seen what your superior officer has said.  But this does not change the fact that you jumped willingly off a building."

I rolled my eyes.  "I've been jumping off of buildings since I was eight years old, Dr. Wilton.  I started out jumping from the stair cases and the platforms because I'm terrified of heights.  Riding in a fucking elevator makes my stomach churn and my anxiety levels spike.  Jumping from heights was how I conquered my fear enough to be able to ride the glass elevator without burying me face in my hands and clenching my jaw so hard I couldn't speak for hours.  Jumping became a way for me to control my anxiety.  It's 8 seconds of freedom.  Freedom from all this bullshit.  I had full control of my life.  I could choose to end it if I ever wanted to.  But as I've said before I'm an egotistical bastard and I have no intention of ever hurting the one person who I can count on - **me**."

"Why are you and Dr. Eriksen so insistant that I am a danger to myself?  Did she ever think to ask me if I might willingly stay someplace she had free reign?  Does anyone ever think to ask the fucking lab rat what he might do?"  I crossed my arms and sighed. "What the fuck do you want to talk about today?"
