# Unexpected Behaviors
_Wednesday, July 15, 2015 2:30 PM_

I did as Madison had suggested and put things away.  Or at least hid my bag in the closet and took out the supplies that Margo had left me.  My nightmare journal I hid under my pillow after I made my bed.  Not exactly a hiding place, but it was close at hand when I woke up in the middle of the night to sketch the images.  Not that my nightmares ever changed - they were always the same. Always.

I put the food on the table too.  It was mostly high energy stuff that I could store at room temperature even after opening.  Things like nuts, dried fruits, jerky.  There was even a box of cereal.  I didn't really like cereal, there were so many other ways to get nutrition than from a manufactured food.  But beggers couldn't be choosers.

A faint knock came at my door and then another woman walked in with a bright smile.  

I grinned at her, "You must be Sarah."

She nodded.  "Dr. Silverman is here to see you now.  Normally we have you go to a therapy room but since this is your first day, and you are still unpacking and such, she will with you in here."

"Fine by me."  Sarah smiled and nodded as she opened the door and let Margo in.  My beautiful blonde therapist stepped through with her green eyes and the first thing I noticed was her apple blossom perfume.  It was a welcome comfort in a place that smelled of nothing but santizing cleaning fluids.  

Margo sat down in the chair Madison had pulled away from the table.  I sat down across from her on the bed.  "Margo.  A pleasure."  Sarah giggled as she closed the door behind her.

Margo just rolled her eyes at the girl.  "Nox.  How are you doing?"

"Pretty good.  Stuck in the hospital.  Told I'm a danger to myself and others. Still reeling from what happened after I woke up.  But like I said I'm doing pretty good despite all that.  I've met some interesting folks, and reunited with my first."

Margo laughed, "I have so many questions now from that small little statement.  Your first?  As in your first love?"

I laughed.  "You know damn well I've never been in love before now.  My first.  THE first.  My first time having sex with someone."

Margo made a few notes in her small black notebook and set it aside again.  "Oh.  You are in love now?"

I felt my skin flush and my stomach tied itself into knots as I looked down.  "I shouldn't have said that.  Yes and no."

Margo put her hand on my knee and patted gently.  "Tell me about it."

I let out a long breath and sighed.  "I find myself drawn to someone."  I looked up and saw those bright green eyes stairing back at me and I couldn't help but feel safe in them.  "It was an typical attraction.  I felt 15 again.  I was head over heels in lust over him.  Then we spent a casual night together.  He let me in - let me see him at his worst moment.  I fell hard.  Then Levi attacked and he hurt him."  I saw Margo's mouth form an 'O' as she realized in that moment who I was talking about. "When I woke up I told him how I felt.  It was a moment of weakness on my part."  I looked down and frowned, "He was conflicted before that and I only made it worse.  He tried to stay but the strain was too much.  He walked out without another word."

Margo nodded, "Give it time Nox.  Whatever happens will happen."

I shrugged.  It was difficult to do moving on or at least letting go.  It had always been a hard thing to do.  

Margo pulled her chair closer and I looked up to see her closer than usual.  "Nox.  I know this is hard.  Talk to me.  Don't brood over it."

I fell back against my bed, my head knocking into the wall behind me.  "This is why I don't let people in, Margo.  This is why I am the way I am.  I hate that feeling.  I don't want it.  It's only going to make this whole thing worse.  And then you make me do something he will be interested in.  He will come even if he hates me, he will come.  I am nothing more than his little pet project."  I stood up in a huff and started pacing back and forth.

Margo leaned back in her chair as I walked for several seconds.  "Nox sit down."  

There was no doubt in my mind when I heard the command in her voice.  I obeyed without question.  I sat down on the far end of my bed away from her - away from the comfort she'd bestoy.  I didn't want anyone to get close; I was falling back into old habits.  

"Nox, think about it."  I could hear the tempered anger in her voice.  She was upset with me for my behavior.  For my feelings?  Self doubt started to creep in.  "He's 13 years your senior."

I couldn't help but interrupt.  "He slept with Jason.  Age has no fucking say in it."  I could feel the venom dripping from my tongue as I said it.  I didn't really care whether or not Jace and Dorian had a fling - granted one neither decided to tell me about until things got heated.  Not my fault!

Margo sighed, "It may not.  Give him time.  He's not like you.  He cares about what other people think about him, Nox."

I wanted to get up and start pacing again but I stayed still and started bending patterns around me in my angst.  "I'm nothing but a fearful child in his eyes.  A kid to watch over and guide and care for.  I'm his damned little duckling."  I threw a fireball across the room and watched it disapate against the wall in a haze of smoke and sparks.  The fire alarms went off and I started from my misery.  I hated that sound.

There was a scramble of people outside my door, almost all trying to get in.  I rolled my eyes as I waited for the fire squad to come in.  I looked at the first man in riot gear standing in my door way and gave him an awkward smile and a wave of my hand, "Sorry.  Nothing to see here."

Margo stood up and walked over to pressed the intercom system button.  "He was just venting his feelings.  He's sorry.  It won't happen again you can turn the infernal thing off and call back the fire squad."

The remainder of my time with Margo was fighting with the fire squad.  No, I wasn't a danger.  No, it wasn't an accident.  Yes, I threw the fireball on purpose at the wall because I was pissed off.  Margo had to leave before I was done with my interogation.

Madison came in and sent everyone away.  She gave me a stern look.  "Nox, don't do that again.  Please, for the love of god, don't be a danger to anyone."

I sighed and flopped down on my bed.  "Fine.  I'll be a good little boy."  I drew my arms up over my face and covered my eyes.  "I didn't hurt anyone.  I  knew exactly where it would land, what it would do and how it would decay.  I'm not an idiot."

Madison sighed, "Nox.  The longer you are like this the longer you will stay here."

I sat up in a hurry and glared at Madison.  "I shouldn't even fucking be here.  I am not a danger to myself.  I'm not going to fucking slit my wrists, or jump from a building with nothing but gravity to do its job.  I'm not going to hang myself with my shoelaces and I sure as hell am not going to blow my brains out with my gun.  I'm an egotistical bastard who loves himself too much.  Why the fuck would I hurt the only person I fucking care about!"

Madison took two steps forward and I held up my hand and then laid down with my back to her, "Just go."  I didn't want to be comforted.  I didn't want to any of this.  I wanted to wallow in my self pity for a while.  

I hugged the not-my-pillow to my body like it was a long lost friend and buried my face in it.  It smelled of nothing - exactly like this place.  I threw it across the room and lay staring at the ceiling.

Without a clock or my phone I was lost on time.  I don't know how long I stared at the ceiling before I got up and pulled the pencils and notebook that Margo had given me and I started drawing patterns.  I wanted to throw things so bad, so nearly every sketch I started was of something I could throw.  

At first each sketch was of just a plain weave - a fireball, a ball of air or water and finally a ball made of earth.  I started playing with the weaves in front of me as I thought about things.  I crafted unique forms and let them dance in front of me while I sketched their underlying patterns.  

I heard the door unlock and the intercom say dinner time.  But I stayed in my seat sketching the complex pattern I'd crafted.  It was in its finished state a replica of what made me Cesari in the first place - a small statue of a man standing with a globe of earth and air above his head.  I sketche each element in the color I saw, in the strength of the thread of the pattern each line grew darker.

The day grew dim and there was a knock on my door.  A new face appeared inside.  "You missed dinner."  I didn't look up or even really respond.  I wasn't in the mood.  "You have to eat son."

"I'm not your son."  I kept drawing.

"I know that.  I'm Nurse Gloria and I'll be tending you during the night shift."  She set a tray down on my table and I glanced at the covered plate then up at her.  She smiled, her hair was slightly graying, she was late with a dye job apparently.  Her eyes were dark - not in color but she was weary.  

I turned back to my work.  "Thanks."

"Are you going to brood the remainder of the night.  The lights will go out at precisely 8pm."

When I didn't say anything she left closing the door behind her.  I looked up at the camera again and sighed.  There was no way to truly hide from these people.

I continued to sketch the complicated weaves that made up the statue I'd made.  I was on a countless page by the time the lights went out and I looked up to the dim green glow of the lights left on so the camera's could still see things.  I created a floating orb of light as far from the sensors as possible and let it flicker and flutter as I continued to draw.
