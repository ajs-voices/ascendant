# Little Wolf
_Friday, July 17, 2015 9:00 AM_

I did manage about two hours of sleep before the wake up alarm at 7am went off.  I had three plants - two living sitting on my table next to my laptop.  I was rather proud of my work.  The smell of the candles still lingered in my room and I was glad for that little pick me up as I started my morning yoga routine before breakfast.

Breakfast came and went.  And now it was med time. Madison handed me the bottle of pills as Barry had done the night before.  "I marked it with a black X on the bottom so you can verify it's the same bottle."

I grinned at her and took the two pills freely.  Lori giggled as usual.  I didn't think I was still making a face, it didn't taste bad this time.  It was a true sugar pill.  I stuck my tongue out at the girl who I was beginning to think was a teenager or at least had the personality of one.  

Today as we made our way into the common area for our social interactive groups I found out it was movie day.  The whole place sat down for a movie.  The entire room had been rearranged into comfortable sections.  Couches were moved, there were a few bean bags on the floor and pillows and various other comfort items laying around.  I stood back and watched as everyone gathered in spots and sat down.  Each person seemingly having their own places.  

A small hand snunk in mine and dragged me off towards her spot.  "You can sit with us."  Us... were she and Jo actually friends and no one knew it?  I was mildly curious.

But Us was the whole table comandered a spot in the front on the floor.  Philip, Bob and Duke sat on the couch behind where Lori dragged me.  Cliff was curled up in a recliner next to the couch and Jo and Lori were waiting on me to sit down.  

Lori pulled me down next to her on the floor and Jo sat down on the other side.  Both girls leaning on me like I was some sort of pillow.  I chuckled to myself.  Everyone was seated and the room was a chaotic din of talking between various groups, except ours.  We all sat in our own little worlds waiting for the movie to start.  

I was lost in the scent of the forest and had the extra warmth of two bodies pressing in against me.  It was comforting and distracting.  The lights went out and the big screen TV started playing.  It was almost like the set up in Dorian's apartment.  I wrapped an arm around both of the girl's shoulders and settled against the couch as the trailers played.  

It seemed we were to watch 'Jupiter Ascending' - Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum starring opposite one another.  Lori giggled in my ear, "He's cute."

I rolled my eyes.  I was _that_ friend.  Jo whispered, "You don't think so?"

I sighed.  "He's alright.  There are far better men to drool over though."

Lori giggled, "Oh do tell."

I shusshed her and she fell into a fit of giggles against my chest.  We received several more shushes and glares from those near by.  I didn't really want to be their gay friend.  I seriously hated that stereo type.  But Madison's words hit home and I decided I could for now be that person. 

I watched the movie, or at least I started to.  I closed my eyes for a few moments and before I knew it I was drifting in the darkness.  The sounds of the movie blended with my kalidescope of images.  The images were the same as usual.  Garrett's demon face with red glowing eyes watching in the darkness.  The tails of air and earth across my body.  It was no different than any other dream I'd had up until the voice spoke again, "I'm coming for you." 

I started awake.  Jo and Lori's weight kept me from sitting up they both looked at me.  The credits had started rolling when I glanced up at the screen.  I'd slept through most of it.  I could feel the tension in my neck and my back.  

Lori slipped from my arm and grinned down at me.  "You move too much in your sleep."  

I smiled at her playfully, "Nightmares do that."

The smile from her face slipped away and she frowned.  I sighed, "No need for concern.  I'm alright."

The crowd started to separate and go their own ways.  I felt a presence looming behind me and a gust from the ventalation sent the soft scent of forest to me.  I looked up behind me and saw a graying woman with amber eyes.  She smiled down at me, "You wanted to see me?"

I nodded.  "Yes Ms. Stricklen.  This is Jo."  She eyed the little wolf and then sat down on the couch.  I pulled my long frame up and sat down on it as well.  Jo clung to my leg still on the floor.  I ran my fingers through her brown locks and she leaned her head against my hand.

LouAnn laughed, "It's LouAnn, Nox.  You've approached me before with were creature questions and I've told you this."

I nodded.  "I remember."

She frowned.  "I am sorry for the loss of your mother.  I wish I could have helped."

I shrugged, "No big deal.  Really.  I've a few questions about young pups specifically."

"What do you need to know?"  She kept casting a glance at the little wolf attached to my leg.  She grinned down at Jo.

"When exactly do born were's first turn?"  I asked.  Jo clung to me harder.

LouAnn nodded.  "Anywhere between 20 and 25 in most cases.  They get increasingly more aggressive as the moons pass in those ages.  Is she getting worse?"

I shrugged.  "I only just met her two days ago.  But she was brought in 20 years ago because of incontrollable rage issues."

"She could turn any moon then.  She needs an Alpha."  LouAnn tapped her finger to her lips and shook her head.  "There are no Alphas you want to help in town.  We could call an outside pack."  She sighed.  "No one will want to help an unstable wolf pup, Nox."  

I rolled my eyes.  "She's not unstable.  She has no training.  Just like every other rogue were out there who's turned against their will.  Someone brought her in to help her.  We can't let her fall through the cracks."

LouAnn laughed.  "You are an odd duck for a hunter.  You know that right.  Everyone else would put her out of their misery."

With every statement Jo clung harder to my leg.  LouAnn leaned in close and took a big whiff.  It was a very were thing to do.  I raised an eeybrow in question and she shook her head.  "I don't think she needs an Alpha anymore." 

"Me?"  

With a very big nod of her head LouAnn said, "You smell like wolf today.  And not her wolf.  You still smell like a dragon.  You always have.  But today you also smell of the forest."  She asked, "Have you ever been bitten by a wolf before?"

I shook my head, "No.  No other were either.  I was scratched by a bear."

"You would smell musty and damp not like forest.   Like a cave."

I nodded.  "I know."

"I never did have to make you beleive me, not even when you were little.  If you help her transition I think she'll be alright.  I don't know what it'll do to you though."  LouAnn stood up then knelt down by Jo and ran her hand over the side of Jo's face.  "He'll take care of you."

She stood up and looked at me.  "She shouldn't be left alone without her Alpha at the end of this month - July 30th, 31st and August 1st are the next transition days."

I nodded.  "I doubt they'll let that happen."  How the hell did that happen?  And why?  Things were getting weirder each day I was here.  

LouAnn left and Jo crawled up next to me on the couch.  "What did she mean?"

I wrapped an arm around her and knew LouAnn was likely right.  "She thinks you made me your Alpha."

"What's an Alpha?"  Jo really didn't know anything about the world she was fixing to enter.  And there was a whole lot of things to explain and I didn't even know half of it.  We would need to find a proper Alpha, I couldn't teach her how to be a werewolf.  What the Venatori knew was very limited.  I guess I was fixing to learn a lot more about them than I'd ever thought possible.

For the next hour or so Jo and I spoke in quiet whispers about what could happen during the full moon.  I had only seen one change in my life.  Every Venatori regardless of their nature watched a wolf turn.  Every one knew the dangers to their person.  But what I needed to understand was what Jo was about to go through.  Maybe the next full moon, but with in the next three years.  

I knew there were Alphas in town, but they were mostly gang bangers, mobsters or thugs.  The city packs were usually all like that.  Jo needed a rural pack, one in a small town that was more family than gang.  However the Creed of Celestial Beings was headquartered here and they could bring in any Alpha they wanted.  But the CCB disliked Venatori and there would be bigger issues if I called someone there.  Too many problems.
