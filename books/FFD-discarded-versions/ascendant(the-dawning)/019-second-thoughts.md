# Second Thoughts
_Sunday, July 19, 2015 8:00 AM_

I finished my work out well before dawn.  I ate breakfast and took a shower beform 4am even rolled around.  I was on my second pot of coffee as I started dipping my toes into what Dae'lin had assigned me.  

7AM was here before I knew it and I was pulling Drake from the covers.  He was half asleep as I helped him with a bath.  The running water and the envigorating smells from the cleaning products woke the little one up enough that he was sitting on a bar stool with ease as he watched me make him eggs and sausage with a side of toast.  He didn't complain with what I offered him with a plastic glass and a normal straw filled with milk.

I sipped at my coffee and Drake was happily eating away when there was a knock at my door.  I expected Dorian but maybe not this soon.  I opened the door and smiled as I saw him standing all bright eyed decked out in his usual suit and tie.  It was rare to see Dorian in anything else I was gathering.  I wondered what else was in his closet.  

I opened the door and Dorian stepped inside avoiding me.  It made me wonder if something had changed between last night and now.  He walked over to my cupboard and pulled out an orange and brown stoneware coffee mug and poured himself a cup of coffee and sipped at it black.  I took a mental note and I vowed to remember what he drank.

He smiled at me.  "I knew you'd have a pot."  Dorian sighed.  "You'd think I'd make my own before leaving the apartment.  I do have coffee and a pot afterall."

I grinned.  "You just like when I make it." 

Dorian's eyes dropped to the floor as he smiled.  I took a few steps towards him and he looked up casting me a warning glance.  Something had changed and my heart sank.

He was having second thoughts.  Slow wasn't slow enough.  I nodded and went to sit down next to Drake.  "Hey buddy.  Dorian's going to take you to class this morning okay?"  Drake looked up at Dorian and smiled a toothy grin.  "I hope to pick you up but I won't know if I can or not.  Someone will pick you up and bringing you here.  Bring you home."

Drake looked at me with his large orange eyes and blinked.  It took him a few moments before he his smile widened and he whispered.  "Home?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  This is your home now.  With me."

Drake nodded and lunged for me forcing me to catch him lest he fall to the floor.  He wrapped his arms around me and squeezed tightly.  I hugged him back and whispered to him.  "That makes me happy too."  Though I could feel the fear of Garrett doing something to those I loved well up inside of me.  Seeing him had really thrown me.  My anxiety was ratched up to a whole new level and I didn't like it.

Dorian looked at Drake with a smile.  "Why don't you go get your things Drake?  I need to talk to Nox for a minute."

Drake scurried down the length of my body and down the hall to my room to collect his bag.  Dorian moved towards me and stood next to the barstool I was sitting in.  "I'm sorry."

I looked up at him, "About what?"

Dorian looked down, "For stopping you."

I shrugged.  "Whatever.  I said slow."

Dorian shook his head.  "It's not that, Nox.  I..."  He shook his head with frustration.  "I...There is still a part of me..."

I stood up on the opposite side of the barstool.  "I get it Dorian.  Last night was a weak moment.  We were both emotional."  I took my coffee mug and Drake's plate to the sink and started cleaning them.

"That's not it Nox."  He followed me around to the sink and took my wrist in his hand and turned me to face him.  He leaned in and kissed me softly.  

I took his lips eagerly with mine but I pulled away.  "Then why did you stop me before?"

Dorian looked towards the hallway.  "What do we want to show the boys?  I know Stella has an issue."

Nox laughed.  "I don't care what Stella has an issue with.  Aidan will eventually learn that his father likes men.  Drake is going to figure out that I like both quickly.  Why hide it Dorian?  What does it matter what someone else thinks."

Dorian sighed.  "That's the difference between you and I.  I do care what they think."

"So do you want to be with me or not Dorian?"  I was getting aggravated.

"I want to try.  But image..."

I interrupted.  "I know image is everything.  If we can't be together in the privacy of my own home then what's the point?"

Dorian pulled me close to him.  "You have a point.  This is private.  The boys will find out."

I grinned at him and kissed him softly before pulling away.  "Drake needs to get to class.  I don't want to start off my having him in a negative way."

Dorian laughed.  "Alright.  Will I see you later?"

I nodded.  "I'll call you later and we can figure something out.  I might need you to get Drake."

"Okay."  Drake came out pulling a small bag behind him.  Dorian looked at him, "Blanekt, cup, change of clothes?"

Drake grinned up at Dorian with a nod.

I asked, "You've done this before?"

Dorian nodded.  "Drake has stayed with Aidan and I a few nights."  Drake handed Dorian the bag and held his arms in the air.  Dorian picked him up and lifted him towards me.  "Say good-bye to Nox.  So we can go and not be late." 
Drake leaned in and hugged me and gave me a kiss on the cheek.  

"Bye buddy.  I'll see you later."  Dorian leaned in and kissed me deeply.  He left me breathless as he pulled away.  I barely could speak. "I'll call you when I know what's up."

Dorian nodded.  "Sounds good.  We'll see you later."

I watched Dorian leave my apartment for the second time in as many days.  I hoped this would be come a reality for us both.  But I knew that was a lot to ask for.  But I could hope.
