# Reaching Out
_Sunday, July 19, 2015 2:00 PM_

After Dorian left I went downstairs to take care of some shopping.  I hated shopping but this wasn't for me.  This was all stuff that I needed for Drake if we were going to do this right.  I purchased a bunk bed and all the required accessories for one.  I never knew a kid needed so many little things.  The sales woman helping me was going on about kids and being a parent.  She asked me how old mine was.  When I told her she did a double take.  "You don't look old enough to have a son that old."  I was plenty old enough to have a child that old, I'd been sexually active since I was 13 and puberty happened shortly there after in full swing.  But I didn't tell her that.  I told her the truth, that I was his legal guardian.

By the time I was done with the furinture shopping I didn't have time to hit any of the clothing stores or toys before I needed to head back up and get Drake.  I wanted to be early so I could meet the other parents of Drake's class.

I took the elevator.  I shouldn't have as my mind recoiled at the thought of heights and I knew that the sensors in my ankle monitor would send that to the monitoring station.  It made me wonder what would happen if I were to have sex while wearing it.  I laughed to myself at the thought.  The woman in the elevator with me turned and gave me an angry glare.  I appologized.  "Sorry."

I could only imagine what the people monitoring would think of the spikes in my vitals then.  I might have to find out.

The Academy was a big place and there were plenty of people around as I wound my way towards the day care area.  There were other parents there and some older kids too.   I didn't wait with the rest of the parents.  I went straight into Drake's classroom and Ms Helen smiled at me.  "I expected you'd be here early."

I grinned.  "Am I that predicitable?"

She shook her head.  "Oh, no.  Nothing like that.  Mr. Vega stopped by before lunch and saw Aidan and indicated that you'd likely want to meet the parents of the kids."

I nodded.  "He was right."

I sat with the kids on the floor as Ms. Helen read them a story while they finished off the end of their lessons for the day.  The first parent arrived and Ms. Helen was greating them as Rhiana pulled her father's hand and tugged him towards me.  "Daddy.  Daddy.  This is Mr. Nox. He makes fun things that are pretty."

I stood up and offered the man my hand.  "Nox Sétanta.  I'll be helping this lot with some of the basic Magnus studies."

He nodded.  "Michael Burnett.  We were told the twins could have an aptitude.  They haven't sparked have they?"

I shook my head.  "Not to my knowledge.  But they are showing signs which is why I'm here, so they don't accidentally spark at inappropriate times.  The goal is to have their ability under control through play and example rather than to let them emotionally respond with it."

He took my hand.  "Sounds like a nice goal.  Though why hasn't it ever been tried before?"

"I don't know, honestly.  Inability to think like a three year old?  I don't have that problem."  I grinned.

The man chuckled softly.  He signed a few things at Joey who was watching us intently.  When they were done talking I intejected.  "How would you suggest I learn ASL?  I dislike not understanding and requiring a translator."

Mr. Burnett's smile widened.  "I can send you source materials and we've several resources here on compound for it.  I'll forward you the information."

"That would be wonderful."  It would be great to have a handle on ASL, I am sure I wouldn't learn it quickly but I would be able to speak to Joey myself.

"Mr. Sétanta, it was great meeting you.  I look forward to seeing what you have in store for the children."

I laughed. "Nox.  Please."

"Nox it is then.  I will let Janice know, she'll be picking them up tomorrow."

I nodded.  "I won't be here tomorrow afternoon for pick up.  I have meetings scheduled from 2 to 4 every weekday.  They have me trying to change the way testing is done as well as this."

"Always have us doing more than necessary."  He herded the children towards the door.  "We will see you later, Nox."

Henry sat in the corner waiting for his parents to show up.  He played by himself while he waited.  Aidan was giggling and rambunctous as I saw Garrett walk into the room.  My heart jumped into my throat and I felt like I was about to have a heart attack it was beating so hard.

He offered me his hand.  "Nox.  Didn't expect to see you."  

I gave him my hand.  I could feel the cool clamly exteriour of my skin and Garrett gave me a wry smile, he knew exactly why I was having a panic attack.  He looked down at Aidan as he wrapped his little arms around Garrett.  "Mr. Nox is my teacher too."

Garrett looked up at me after Aidan spoke and raised an eyebrow.  "Teaching.  Eh?  You should be as good a teacher as I was."

I felt the bile rising.  I wanted to be nothing like Garrett.  I **was** nothing like Garrett.  "Hopefully Aidan won't live the life I did."  

Garrett chuckled at me softly.  "You will come to my place for dinner tomorrow night.  Stella and Aidan will be joining me.  You can bring Drake for a play date.  I won't take no for an answer.  Leave your precious Dorian home, just the three of us and the boys I have something I want to discuss with you.  I don't think you'd like the consequences."

I swallowed the lump in my throat and I couldn't speak.  I could barely nod my ascent.  Garret looked at me.  "All choked up I see.  I expect you to behave better when at dinner."

I managed to croak out.  "Yes, sir."

He grinned at me as he wove tenticals of air behind him and I could feel my eyes go wide and Garrett laughed softly.  "Remember, Nox."

He hid the patterns away and picked up Aidan.  "Let's go, little man.  Your mom is waiting for us for a late lunch."

I wanted to throw up.  My stomach churned.  My shirt was damp and only got worse as I wiped my hands on it.  In my effort to maintain my sanity with Garrett standing in front of me I had missed Henry's parents.  I would have to speak to them later.  

Drake was off playing in the fake house in the corner.  I tried to speak twice before I actually got anything out, and even that was still tinged with fear and anxiety.  "Drake, come on, let's go."

He skipped towards me and took my hand.  He looked up at me with the big orange eyes and I couldn't help but smile.  "What do you want to eat?"  I asked.  I had to change the topic.

Drake shrugged and tugged me out the door.  We made our way to the cafeteria.  "You want to eat here?"

He looked up at me and shook his head.  "You want me to cook?"

Drake gave me a big smile.  "Please."

"Okay then."  I could easily do that for him.  The little boy attached to my hand was helping immensly.  But I could feel the tension in the back of my neck.  Tomorrow I had a dinner date with the man who beat me as a child and I couldn't say no to him.  I was so screwed.
