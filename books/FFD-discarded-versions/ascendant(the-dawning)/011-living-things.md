# Living Things

Jo and I were walking towards the common area when the dinner bell rang.  Jo grinned up at me, "See."

I nodded. "You were right."  We turned around still holding hands as Lori spotted us and slipped under my arm on the other side and curled against my body.  "Hi.  Is everyone touchy feely or is it just me?" I asked.

Lori looked up with a sweet innocent smile, "Just you."

I laughed.  "I suppose that's better than being bullied.  I guess I'll take it."

Lori giggled, "Come on.  You were bullied?  You had to be the bully."

"Depends on how you look at it."  In reality it was a little bit of both.  My mouth got me in trouble more times than not.  But the things that they did were not usually because of my mouth.  

Lori poked me with her finger, "See you were a trouble maker."

Madison stopped in front of the three of us and gave us a stern look.  Lori pulled away and Jo let go of my hand and the two of them stepped around Madison.  I asked, "Am I in trouble?"

"Yes and no.  Follow me."  Madison gave me that you better not make a scene look and I followed her dutifully to the another cooridoor.

"There are a few rules you are breaking today."  She lifted a finger and told me not to interrupt.  I wasn't going to.  I was not fond of breaking rules.  I didn't know anything I had done that was rule breaking so I had nothing to fight against anyway.  She continued on, "We don't slam doors."  I nodded and she returned it.  "There is a no touching other residents policy."

I started to say I didn't know that but she didn't let me interrupt.  "But with those two we will allow it for now.  If it goes beyond what I saw just now however we will have to put a stop to it."

I was confused, but I nodded anyway.  "Madison, I didn't know.  But why the allowance?"

Madison smiled.  "Those two have not made friends here.  Lori is very quiet and shy, except when she's around you.  And Jo, well you seem to temper her anger.  I don't know what you've said to her, but she trusts you and that is big for both of them.  They need it."  She poked me in the ribs.  "And from what Dr. Silverman says, you need it too.  So we are making an exception, Nox.  If you do what you are prone to do in the Academy I will have your head."

I laughed.  "I have no intentions of sleeping with them."

Madion just nodded, she didn't beleive me.  I don't know **what** gave her that idea.  I grinned.  "Dorian Vega has dropped off a plant for you and several other things he said you know what they were for.  They are clearning inspection now and will be available in your room after dinner."

I grinned. "Thanks.  Can I go eat now?"

Madison nodded, "Just remember Nox.  No slamming doors anymore."

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am."

Dorian had brought me a plant to study.  Which meant I'd likey be seeing him tomorrow.  My heart skipped a beat at the prospect but yet I didn't really want to see him.  But I knew that was a lie.

I made my way to my table, everyone was sitting and waiting for the last of us stragglers to show up before they would wheel the carts out.  When I sat down Philip asked me, "You okay, man?"

I gave him my best smile, "Right as rain."

"You're all over the place."  Bob chimed in.  "The darkness is greater."

I closed my eyes and started a breathing exercise. I could have done what I'd shown Dr. Eriksen but the mere thought of her made my blood boil and that wasn't helpful.  I counted backwards from thirty, focusing on breaking in on the even and out on the odd.  

When I looked at Philip he was taking a bit of a peice of bread with a weird smile.  I asked, "Better?"

He nodded.  "Yeah.  You need to teach me that trick."

I uncovered my plate and wasn't surprised by the remark I got from Duke.  "I think he's a plant."  

I flashed Duke a smile.  "It's nothing really.  Just a meditation trick calms anxiety."

Duke interjected, "What you anxious about?  Gotta a pretty boy leaving you gifts, got two girls who can't stop touching you, what more a man need?"

I laughed.  "Not having nightmares that make you fall out of bed would be nice."

Jo gave a sharp laugh and I grinned at her.  "I could do without being poisoned too.  Or tested like a lab rat and let's see..."  I grinned at them hoping they'd take it all as a joke.  Everyone at the table laughed despite the complete truth of my statement.  

Dinner proceeded as usual.  I flirted with Amelia to Cliff's delight and everyone elses amusement.  It was the little things that made us stand out from one another, and here, everyone else had worse quirks than I did.  At least my problems were hidden from their view, though I think Jo suspected far more from my random comments than the others.  She watched me with care, those big brown eyes rarely straying from me or her own plate.  I tried not to let it bother me.  It wasn't the first time I'd had a girl caught in the headlights of my so-called charms.  But I was pretty sure there was more to it than that, I just couldn't figure it out.

The med cart wheeled to us and Madison placed a plastic cup in front of me with two little white pills.  "I will not be taking those Madison."

She frowned but her purple eyes made it look weird as though the frown were a lie.  "Nox.  Please don't make a scene."

I shook my head, "Madison, I will not take another pill that has been perscribed by Dr. Eriksen.  Not here.  Not now and not ever again.  If you want me to take these pills you will hand deliver the unopened bottle of pills to me.  I will not take those pills."

Madison shook her head, "Nox we'll do this hard way if we have to."

I stood up and looked down at Madison.  "You will not.  There is nothing anyone in this place can do to make me do anything I do not wish.  You will have to shoot me with that tranq gun I saw hiding behind the desk if you intend to shove pills down my throat."

"Please Nox, take the pills."

I shook my head.  "No.  You don't care about my reasons do you?"

Madison sighed, "Why won't you take the pills Nox?"

I laughed, "Whatever I saw is just going to make me look like I'm making a scene to make a scene.  It doesn't matter.  I will not take the pills."

A short man came out with a bottle and I grinned.  "Nurse Hatch, here is a new bottle that hasn't been opened."  He handed me the pill bottle.  

I took it with a nod of my head.  "What's your name?"

"Barry."  He was one of my off day guardians.  

I smiled at him.  I looked down at the label, I didn't know what it was, but it wasn't the same pill bottle that Dr. Eriksen had given me, which was still in my hoodie pocket.  I had forgotten I'd had it in my hand when I stormed out of the little room.

I set the unopened bottle down on the table and pulled the other bottle out and handed it to Nurse Hatch with a grim smile.  "This is why I will not take anything from Dr. Eriksen again."  

I grabbed the new pill bottle cracked the seal and poured two of the similar looking pills from the bottle and took them without water.  There was no aftertaste as they hit my tongue.  For which I was eternally grateful.  I handed back the bottle to Barry.  "Thank you."

Madison was still staring at the pill bottle.  Everyone took their pills with ease after my scene and we were released.  I found myself alone with a darling little snake plant sitting next to my laptop.  I smiled at it.  Dorian was true to his word.  I now had a plant to experiment with.

There was a knock on the door and then it opened.  Madison with her purple streak of hair and her purple eyes were not happy, she was furious.  She closed the door behind her and I could see she was stuck for word.  "Where did you get these pills Nox?"

"From Dr. Eriksen.  She handed them to me and confessed to me what she was doing and why."  I laid down on my bed and curled around my pillow in my arms.  

"Why did she have these, Nox?"

I shrugged.  "It doesn't matter."

"I am going to report her to the board."  Madison walked over to the plant and ran her fingers down the length of one of the yellow and green leaves.

"It won't matter.  She's an Eriksen.  And it was research.  I doubt the council will do anything about it either.  Don't make any bigger deal about it than I already have."  I looked up from my hold on the pillow.  "Just don't Madison.  I won't make a scene as long as you promise me that you or Barry will be the **only** ones to give me my pills.  I trust you I swear."

Madison nodded.  "Yeah we can do that.  I will let the pharmacy know as well as the other nurses and my boss.  And we will pull your little conversation."

I nodded and then buried my face in my pillow.  Madison tossed something to me.  The brown paper bag.  "Mr. Vega thought you'd like this."

I sat up and put my legs over the side of the bed, the pillow fell to the floor and I grabbed it and put it back on the bed before I opened the bag.  Inside were candles.  I took the four candles from the bag and laughed softly to myself.  Madison said, "We figured it would be alright since he didn't supply anything to light them with."  She winked at me as she swiped her card.  "I hope it helps."

There was a card inside the bag written with Dorian's neat hand.  "Dr. Silverman said your room smells too clean.  This might help.  - Dorian"

I looked at the candles that Dorian had chosen, the first was a black candle that said it smelled like a campire.  I smiled.  I already knew what the red and the white would be - cinamon and vanilla.  I don't know if I ever told him that but he remembered none-the-less.  The fourth was apples and berries.  It smelled exactly like Margo's office and I knew that Dorian was seeing Margo in some fashion.  

I took the candles and set them around my desk and light the cinamon and vanilla cnadles.  It wasn't long before the room smelled of the two scents and I started drawing the snake plant that Dorian had given me.  

I heard the lights out bell and no voices came over the intercom telling me to go to sleep.  I created a ball of light and continued with my drawing.   The drawings weren't as elaborate as the other, not for a living thing, but there was much more life in the drawing.  It was visible without having to zoom too far in to see the patterns underlying.  

I picked up the plant and broke a leaf from the plant.  "I'm sorry little guy.  I want to try something."  I put the clipping into a cup of water for the time being.

I knew I couldn't create the plant from nothing and it be living, it would just be a replica, made of elements that would eventually decay without life.  I did create one though, to show that it was not possible even with the knowledge of life.  I drew it with the came care as the other.

I knew it was well past lights out by the time I'd finished both plant drawings.  But I wasn't tired, and I really didn't want to repeat the dreams I'd had the past few nights.  So I set to my next task - trying to make a livng plant with a base of a living plant.
