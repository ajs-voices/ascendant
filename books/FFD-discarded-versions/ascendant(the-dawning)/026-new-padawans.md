# New Padawans

As I walked the stairs back to the classroom I could feel things changing.  I hated change, change created anxiety.  The start of a new school year was especially troublesome - new teachers, new classes, new people around me on a daily basis.  Working with the kids would be nice, but it would put me at the whim of the Academy again.  And Margo was weaning me from her.  And the fact that I wanted a real relationship with someone - a first for me.  

Everything was going to be changing and I had to fight the anxiety along with the fears my nightmares and Garrett were invoking.  I focused on what I could control.  And right now that was the lessons to teach young magnus who didn't quite know what they were doing yet.  

I made my way into the classroom and my assitant was happily signing and speaking away, "Get in your seats, your new lessons will start shortly."  She smiled at me as I shut the door behind me.  

She offered me the classroom and all the little eyes were on me.  It was almost unnerving having five sets of little eyes eagerly watching your every move.  I took a deep breath and smiled.  "I'm going to sit over here.  You can join me."  I sat down on the circle carpet at one side and the children formed a circle in front of me.  

I looked pointedly at Joey.  "Show me the sign for fire."

Joey grinned at me with a missing tooth I hadn't noticed yesterday.  He wiggled his all his fingers on both his hands and raised them individually a couple of times.  It kinda looked like a fire.  I nodded at him and smiled.  

"Show me the sign for earth."  I asked him.

He nodded and showed me the sign which I couldn't really explain.  But he shook his head and pointed the picture of the planet on the poster.  "Ah so that's the planet Earth.  Show me what this is."  I formed a pattern of earth and it formed a small rock in my hand.

He held his hands in fists and knocked the right on top of his left.  Rhiana smiled, "That's rock."

I nodded.  I let the rock crumble into sand through my fingers and all the kids giggled.   Joey took both hands and picked up 'sand' from the ground and ground it between his fingers with his thumbs out.  

"Okay.  Not similiar, what do we want to mean the element earth then?"

Joey knocked on his hands and I nodded and mimiced him.  "Earth element it is."  I noticed that Helen was taking notes and I nodded her my thanks.  We'd have to keep things organized some how.

"Air?"

Rhiana shook her head.  "There is no air.  We use wind."  

Joey held both his hands and made a small whooshing circles with his fingers, and I noticed he was blowing out air as well.  Good enough.  I nodded and mimed him.  He grinned.


"And Water?"

Joey made a W with one hand and moved it slight in front of his body at an angle.  I tried it and he grined and stood up and corrected my movement.  I signed "Thank you" and smiled.  I did pay attention as a child - Seasame Street to the rescue!


Now that we had my lesson done for the day I started teaching them.  "Each element has a color."  I signed fire and Joey giggled.  "Fire is red."  I created a very large and very wide pattern of only fire in front of me.  Their eyes all went wide with astonishment as they saw the color take shape in front of me.

I signed earth with the rock movements I'd learned then continued.  "Earth is brown."  I wove earth as I had done the fire before.  The kids inched closer to see the colors and the single element in front of me.

I did the same for the others, making the sign, then telling them the colors - blue for water and yellow for air.  

"Each element is like a building block you play with in your centers.  The ones that stick together.  You build things out of them.  But you have to put them in the right order to make them take real form."  I watched as the kids got excited about building things.  We couldn't do complex yet, I couldn't explain bonds or crystalline structures or how atoms even worked because that was basically what you were doing.  But you didn't need to know all that if you could see what you were doing.  Balls of substances, a soft breeze, little things like that were easy, and actually most kids figured that stuff out without help. 

I was here to make sure these five kids didn't have an accident with their early development - like I had.  An event that traumatized my entire life and still I have mommy issues because of it.  I grinned at my own thoughts I had daddy issues too, just not from that.  I had a lot of issues.

I asked Joey and Rhiana, "Can you two show us all the signs for the colors?  Red, blue, yellow and brown?"

The twins got up in front of the class.  Rhiana dictating the words and Joey signing them.  "Everyone practice okay?  Rhiana you call out a color we'll all sign it, then Joey will correct us."

The twins beamed with joy and everyone else watched waiting for the game to start.  Learning was fun when you made a game of it.  I partipated too.  I was learning as I went too.  Joey giggled everytime he corrected my movements. - to which I think he did on purpose.  

By the time we'd all mastered the four colors the kids were all in fits of giggles.  I couldn't help but grin and feel the child like joy radiating through me.  "Alright, now for another game.  I'm going to form a pattern and you tell me in signs what color you see.  Ms. Helen, can you keep track of who is first and how many points each kid gets?  Tomorrow I'll give the winner a prize."  

"Sure."  My blonde assitant chimes at me.  She started jotting down things and I started.  "Remmber only signs, it's not fair if you speak."

I started slowly with air.  All five of them signed yellow.  I would leave it up to Ms. Helen to determine the winner.  I moved into water and they could all see the blue even if Drake was a little longer in getting it.  He was like me and his water was weaker.  The game was two-fold, I was determining what they were strong in by the speed in which they could see the colors.  I had picked a few tricks up while in school and learning with other Venatori.  I had figured out how to not be a quick as the person closes to me.  I disliked being better than anyone.  It made you popular and drew attention.  I already had drawn alot of attention as a child so I learned how not to do more.  I didn't think it would have come in handy later in life.

I moved through each element fire then earth.  All relatively slowly, then I picked up speed running through the elements randomly.  The kids were smiling and paying attention.  I would move quicker through each round.  

Ms. Helen nodded to me and I smiled after the last one.  "It's all done for today.  We did a lot of learning today.  You even taught me a few things." I winked at the twins.  I stood up and  walked over to Ms Helen and she handed me the paper and I smiled.  "Very well done the lot of you.  I'm impressed.  Tomorrow will be fun."

I patted each of them on the head.  "I will see you all tomorrow with a surprise."  I really had no idea what to do for the kids but I'd figure it out.   They all headed towards their assigned seats for lunch as I took my leave.  I wondered what I needed should do for lunch.  I probably should eat well now I doubted I'd eat much tonight.  I was dreading that.

As I rounded the corner to the head for the stairs a familiar shape stood propped against the door frame waiting.  When he saw me he smiled and stood straight. I stopped half way to the door and grinned playfully at the blue eyed dream standing in front of me.  I could watch him forever.  Dorian closed the distance.  "I knew you'd walk this way.  Lunch?"

I grinned.  "Dorian are you asking me out to lunch?"

He chuckled softly.  "No.  I was asking if you had time to make lunch for me."

I laughed and smiled.  "Always have time to make you lunch, or dinner."  I winked at him.  "Or even breakfast."  He wrapped am arm around my waist and we started towards the door.  I could feel the tension ease in Dorian's arm as we passed into the stair well.  I stopped and Dorian stopped with me.  "You don't have to show affection, Dorian.  I will survive."

He smiled and pulled me close and kissed me softly.  "I want to, even if it's difficult for me."  He started up the stairs and I followed.

I pulled him close to me as we walked up the steps.  "We don't have to be public knowledge."

Dorian shook his head.  "Oh, but we are already public knowledge.  It doesn't take long for rumors to circulate, you know that.  I've heard whisperes of it in the office.  And I know you've spoken to Margo about me."

I grinned. "That's all confidential."

Dorian grinned.  "Yes.  But your father and my father are rather proud that their families might have a permanent connection."

I nearly choked on my laughter.  Dorian asked with a grin, "You find that funny?"

I nodded.  "I bet they never thought their _off_ children would be the ones that brought them a solid familial connection."

"With two married daughters it left little hope.  Nicholas isn't my type."  Dorian grinned.  

I joked.  "And I am?  Nick's got a lot of better qualities, the first and foremost being he's not me."  I grinned at Dorian playfully.

"Maybe I should date Nicholas then?"  Dorian winked at me.

"Be my guest."  I pulled Dorian closer to my hip on the landing and whispered, "He's a damn fine kisser."

Dorian rolled his eyes and pushed me away from him.  "Okay, we can stop that now."

I laughed and grabbed Dorian by the arm and turned him towards me as I put him up against the wall.  I leaned in and whispered, "But not as good as you."  And I kissed him softly.  I could smell the soft undertones of Dorian's calming scent - the sweet vanilla and cinamon that I'd come to love about him.  

The door opened to the landing we were on and the woman stopped in the doorway stunned.  She cleared her throat loadly before hurmphing up the stairs loudly, stomping on each step to let us know exactly how she felt about our public display of affection.  I was snickering as Dorain disengaged from our embrace and pulled me along by the hand.  His grip was firm but gentle and he wasn't embarassed.  He was grinning madly which surprised me.  We stepped out on to the floor and said, "Well that will get the tongues wagging if nothing has yet."

We walked to my apartment hand in hand and for the first time in forever I felt damn good about my shitty life.
