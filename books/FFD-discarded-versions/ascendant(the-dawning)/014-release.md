# Release
_Saturday, July 18, 2015 Morning_

I missed dinner.  I stayed in my room for it. I was wide awake and wallowing in my own self doubts and pity.  I didn't do it often.  But I did do it and it was always annoying when I did so I got up and started an intense yoga routine.  

I worked through the remaining free time and continued well into the night.  It was relaxing and I needed to relax.  I almost always needed to relax.

I slept for a few hours in fits of nightmares.  They all started the same way.  But they didn't end the same.  I had Dorian dying in my arms.  Jo tearing the heart out of Lori with her jowels.  Jace was falling from the building with no wings of air.  I woke up just as Jace was about to smash into the ground. 

I was covered in sweat, the palm of my hands had small red half moons etched into the skin.  I crawled out of bed and went to take a shower.  I was still too early for breakfast when  I was finished.  I was going to have to take a shower once I hit my own place, I smelled like nothing and it bothered me as much as this place smelling like nothing.

I could have skipped breakfast but my stomach rumbled and I went to the cafeteria to sit.  I sat with my head against the table and waited for everyone to show up.  I didn't know what time it was.

Lori sat down in her chair across from me.  "You okay?" she asked.

I shrugged.  "Life could be better."

"You are going home today?"

I sat up and nodded.  "Yeah.  I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry.  It's a good thing."  Lori grinned at me.

I smiled.  "Yeah.  But I won't get to see your smiling face anymore."

Lori's smile grew wider.  "I'll miss your's too."

I asked, "Do you want me to come visit?"

"Could you?"  Lori sounded excited.

I nodded.  "Yeah.  I'm sure I'll have plenty of time."

Lori got up and ran around the table and wrapped her arms around me and squeezed tightly.  "Jo would like that too."

I hugged her back and there was a clearing throat behind us.  A gruff voice sounded.  "Skinny boy here leaving us?"

Lori nodded emphatically as she left to go sit back down.  There was a lingering chill after she left.  Duke sat down in his seat.  "We missed you at dinner."  He glanced around the room.  "I'm sure your health nut food is around here somewhere, no one would touch it."

Lori giggled.  "He's lying.  He ate it."

I looked over at the big black man and grinned.  "Did he now?  How was it."

"Pshah.  I did not."  I could see the sparkling white teeth through his lie.  

"I hope you are a better liar than that."

Duke laughed with gusto.  I could feel the table shake with his laughter.  It was three days since I meet these people and I found that I was going to miss them.  I guess that's what happens when you actually make friends.

Philip and Bob and Cliff all sat down at the same time.  I flirted with Amelia.  "Morning gorgeous."  It brought Lori to fits of giggles again and I couldn't help but smile.  Jo arrived last and she looked worse for wear.  "You alright?"

She nodded.  "Rough night."

I nodded.  If she wanted to share she would.  I wasn't going to press.  She probably had enough of that from everyone else.

We went through the motions of breakfast and medication distribution.  Saturday was an interesting diversion.  They had weekly swimming lessons and play time.  It wasn't my favorite activity and I sat at the edge of the pool watching everyone else splash playfully in the water.  Jo was no where to be found.

Madison sat down next to me and I grinned.  "Brings back memories."  I saw her blush from the corner of my eye.  We'd shared my first experience in a room that overlooked this very pool.  "Sorry."

She smiled.  "Nothing to apologize over.  I wanted to apologize for my part in what Dr. Eriksen did to you." 

I turned to her and put my finger against her lips.  "Not necessary.  Don't bring it up again."  I grinned at her and leaned back against the wall and stared up at the ceiling.

Madison stood up and beckoned me to follow her.  "Jo wants to talk to you."

I got up and looked around I didn't see Jo.  Madison smiled.  "She doesn't participate here either.  You can join her in the library."

Ah, that's where she'd gotten to.  I nodded.  "Thanks."

I found Jo sitting at a table reading a book.  There were several other books piled up on her table as well.  I whispered, "Hey."

"Hi."  She looked up at me with big brown eyes and gave me a half smile.  "I'm sorry."

I raised an eyebrow.  "For what?"

"Yesterday.  I know you were just trying to help."

I sat down next to her and patted her hand on the book in front of her.  "It's alright.  No big deal."

"You aren't mad at me?  The way you left..."  She sounded sad and afraid.

"I'm not mad at you."  Rejection was one of those things that set me off.  "I left so I wouldn't do something stupid."  I wrapped my arm around Jo's shoulder.  "I'm a real ass at times."

"Lori said you would come visit."  She clearly was changing the topic.  

"Yeah.  I'll visit you and Lori.  If you want me to."  Jo nodded.  "Then I will come visit."  I wished she'd let me get her out of here, find her a pack something else to help her out.  She was just a young pup and she just needed to learn.  

My father stepped into view from around a book case and he cleared his throat.  "I didn't want to interrupt."

I smiled at him.  "Not interrupting.  Am I released?"

Kai nodded.  "Yep.  You ready to go?"

I stood up and then kissed the top of Jo's head.  "I am. I'll see you around little wolf."

I joined my father and he took me through a door that the employee's used.  "Your things were packed and taken to your new place.  I figured you'd not care too much since you hadn't unpacked anything."

I grinned.  "I didn't expect to stay too long."

Kai laughed, "Your charming personality get you out of here?"

"Something like that."

"The girl.  Anyone tell you her story?"  Kai asked.  I could tell he knew something and didn't exactly want to tell me about it.

I shrugged.  "You mean Jo's story?"  He nodded.  "Yeah I know the basics of it.  Family killed by wolves.  She was bitten, hopsitalized, bounced from foster home to foster home until some Venatori rounded her up and brought her here.  Why?"

Kai sighed.  "I brought her in."

I stopped in the hallway before the final door to my release from this sterile place.  "You?  Why?  I mean I'm glad you didn't kill her, but **you** didn't kill her."

Kai nodded.  "I'd met a boy who shed some light on things I had always assumed."

"You met a boy?"  I thought about it for a second.  "You mean me?"

Kai started walking again and I followed absently.  I didn't really want to be here any longer than necessary.  He explained, "It was a year after I'd met you.  I'd followed your progress.  I saw your record.  No unnessary kills.  At first I thought you were weak and not suited for the job.  Then I read the reports.  You weren't killing because you were incapable of it.  You weren't killing because you beleived the punishment didn't fit the crime.  When I saw the girl who had rampaged through the one of the shops downstairs all I could see was she was a girl.  Not much older than you and Nick.  She wasn't rampaging in were form it was the middle of the day.  But she showed every other sign of were.  I didn't know what to do so I tranqued her and took her to the Infirmary where they said she was genetically werewolf.  I had her committed because I didn't know what else to do.  I couldn't kill her."

I smiled.  "Thanks for not doing that.  She's just has no one to help her through the transition."

Kai nodded, "Until you.  And that's another reason."

"What is?"  I wasn't exactly sure how I fit into the equation.

"When I was first given the case you flashed through my head.  A future that I couldn't decifer.  And I was still wary of anything related to your existance but I couldn't figure out the meaning of the vision so I didn't want to kill her if she was somehow linked to you. I needed to know.  It seems you've met her now so any ideas?"  Kai walked with purpose through the compound.  He didn't even think twice when he turned towards the stairs instead of heading for the elevator.  I wondered if he'd been talking with Margo about be.  That was the plan after all.

"I ask LouAnn to come speak with me and Jo.  She is wolf.  And apparently I'm her Alpha now.  Not exactly sure how that happened since I'm not a wolf."

Kai shook his head.  "No that's not it either.  Though it feels closer.  Whatever it is I can't figure it out.  She'll be important somehow.  More important that you watching over her as her Alpha that is."  He grinned at me.  "It would be you who makes a bigger scene then I did."

I laughed.  "Like father like son.  You've been speaking with Margo haven't you?"

Kai missed a step as we climbed up higher in the Apex building.  He looked up at me.  "How did you know that?  She wouldn't have said anything."

I smirked down at my father.  "Kai, I am observant and now I think there is more to it than what I original thought.  I said something because you took the stairs instead of the elevator.  There is only one person who explicitly takes the stairs because of me and that's Dorian.  And that's because he knows how terrified I am of them - even still they bother me."

Kai laughed in relief.  "Yes.  We've been talking about you over the past month.    Since you set that meeting for me I've seen her about every week to learn more new things about the son I never got to know."

"And every other time you see Margo?"  I asked with a playful grin.

He shook his head.  "I over reacted didn't I?"

I nodded.  "Yep.  How long has Mr. Love-em-and-Leave-em been seeing my therapist?"

Kai started back up the stairs.  "Two weeks I'd gather since I asked her to dinner.  We've had lunch everyday for thos two weeks.  Somedays we talk about you, most days we don't."

"Other the mother of your first children that's a pretty long relationship, right?" I asked.  I could hear the hope in my voice begging to be something my father said yes to.

Kai nodded.  "Yes.  Not exactly looking to settle down. But..."

"Time moves forward our goals change, Dad."

Kai grinned as he stopped on a landing and moved towards the floor door.  "I like hearing that from your mouth."

I laughed.  "Dad?"

Kai nodded.  "Yeah, I didn't think you've ever stop calling me Kai.  It felt wrong."

I grinned.  "Don't get used to it.  You have been Kai Viddens a lot longer than you've been my father.  And since Mr. Viddens and sir bother you I have only one choice left.  But Dad is starting to grow on me."

I put my arm around my father's shoulder, "So Dad, where are you taking me. This is a bit too high class for me isn't it?"

Kai laughed.  "You'd be surprised what falling from a building and surviving gets you in status points around here."

"I should have done it sooner then it seems."  I was of course joking.  I'd truly wished I hadn't done it at all. And now there was this "you-cannot-die" thing hanging over my head.  And it was tempting to test the theory.  But I wouldn't be reckless - at least that's what I kept promising myself.
