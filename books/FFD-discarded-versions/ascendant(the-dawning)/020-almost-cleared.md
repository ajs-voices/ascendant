# Almost Cleared
_Sunday, July 19, 2015 9:30 AM_

I worked on drawing patterns for Dorian.  With a specific set of parameters to help him identify a person based on what their external pattern was.  It was a slow process and I really could only draw from memory those people I knew well.  Which to say was near no one.  So I started the basic drawings for each type and I'd figure out the rest as I found one to sketch.

But there was a knock at my door and I got up to answer it.  I expected Margo to be standing outside and was surpised to see Dr. Wilton standing with her.  His frumpy hair was more scattered than usual and Margo looked frustrated as well.  I sighed and opened the door wider.  "Are you staying or am I going?"

Margo stepped inside.  "We can do this here as well as any other place.  Drake at school?"

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am, Dorian dropped him off for me.  And picked him up."

She nodded.  "Excellent.  You've not left the room since your father delivered you?"

I nodded again.  I wasn't exactly sure what was going on.  She looked to Dr. Wilton.  "I told you, you could trust him."

Dr. Wilton frowned.  "It's not that I don't beleive you Dr. Silverman.  It's just that I have my orders.  If he's to be out of the evaluation program, then we need to keep track of him."

"Keep track of me?"  I asked.

Margo sat down on the couch.  "Yes, Nox.  Dr. Wilton and Dr. Eriksen want to put an tracking bracelet on to insure you do not harm yourself or go near the roof."

I shrugged.  "Do I get to leave the compound?"

Dr. Wilton frowned.  "We'd prefer you didn't."

I prepared two glasses of water and ice from the dispenser in the refridgerator door.  Fancy - no more need for bottles of water in the fridge.  I brought them both a glass and shook my head.  "You'd prefer not, but that doesn't mean I can't.  You'd rather I stay locked up here and do what?  Twiddle my thumbs?  It's not like you are going to let me hunt anything, so what am I going to do?  Jump in front of a subway train?  Please."

To show the possiblities I created a pattern that was suitably sharp and pointy and let it manifest in my hand right in front of Dr. Wilton.  "I could easily create any sort of weapon if I truly wanted to off myself.  Do you intend to ban me from this?  And if you do how do you intend to enforce it?"

The scraggly man's eyes grew wide as he realized exactly what I meant.  There were far simpler ways for me to kill myself if I so desired.  I grinned at the man.  "If I wanted to go without violence it's easy enough to suck the oxygen out of an enclosed place, or create carbon monoxide to fill the same space.  Really I don't need anything to kill myself other than myself."

Dr. Wilton nodded.  "Given these facts.  I think it's safe to say that leaving the compound is fine.  However you will not be allowed to hunt in the field.  You take too many risks and we need to assess that.  Honestly I'm surprised you haven't been recalled before."

I rolled my eyes.  I was done playing this game.  "Fine.  Put the monitor on and get out of my apartment."

Margo's expression changed slightly.  I guess she was surprised I accepted the limitations so easily.  At this point I really didn't care.  I was just glad to have some semblance of life back.  Even if it required me to be nothing that I was trained for.  I was reverting to my highschool status.  Relegated to the compound and unable to be free.  But I could live with that right now.  I had people here, I wasn't a child and I could set my own schedule, live my own life.  I was okay with that.

Dr. Wilton pulled a monitor out of his briefcase.  The thing was black and bulky and I sighed at the sight of it.  He got down on the floor with one knee, "Lift your pant leg."

I grinned.  "Dear Doctor I didn't know we were that friendly yet."

Margo stiffled a grin behind her hand and Dr. Wilton just glared at me as I lifted my left pant leg for him to attach the stupid device that would monitor my wearabouts as well as my life signs.  It was standard Venatori tactics on a questionable supernatural.  There were probably several hundred locators just like this in New York City alone, not including the Bouroughs or Long Island.  And now I was one of the few.  I'm actually surprised they hadn't done this sooner.

Dr. Wilton checked the blinking lights before he stood up and collected his things.  "Mr. Sétanta.  You are free and clear.  You are required to meet with me once a month in the company of Dr. Silverman.  You are also required to meet with Dr. Eriksen for evaluation of your symptoms on a weekly basis.  Failure to comply with these rules will find you back under suicide watch.  The time limit for evaluation is currently three months."

I nodded.  "Fine.  Begone foul being."  I waved my hands at him and grinned.  I really wanted him out of my place.  Dr. Wilton gave me a dirty looks.  If only looks could kill.  He found his way to my door, I didn't bother showing him out.

Margo snickered as the door finally closed behind him.  "You are a hirrible, horrible person Nox Sétanta."

I grinned at her.  "Yes ma'am.  You are staying?"

Margo nodded.  "I needed to discuss a few things with you while you are still in a good mood."

I frowned.  "I'm not really in a good mood."

"I know.  I was being sarcastic.  But I still need to talk to you."  I nodded and Margo continued.  "Drake's placement was done well before the idea of a psych eval was needed on you.  Several of the daycare workers and such have expressed a concern that you are not a fit parent.  And I'm fully aware of your capabilities and have written a psych profile for you to give to the daycare in order to stem these issues.  I also explains why the eval is in place to begin with.  You should not read the note Nox.  You won't like the words in it, but they are necessary.  But it states your character as I professionally beleive it to be, references from your father, Dae'lin and Dorian, and a medical explanation for the psych eval, it is the latter that I don't want you to read."

"I won't open it at all.  I don't imagine there is anything new in that document."  I added, "Dxcept maybe Dorian's opinon of me."  I

Margo nodded.  "The second thing.  Your father wanted me to tell you, now that you are officially Drakes legal guardian, a small fund has been added to your account to purchase children items.  And your weekly stipened has increased to accomodate the second mouth to feed.  We had alread used most of the funds given to you when we found out Drake was coming your way."

"That's alright.  He spent the night with me last night.  For which I am thankful."   I took a deep breath and told Margo the truth.  "I still didn't sleep well.  My dreams have changed.  They've been different since the coma."

Margo frowned.  "Worse how so?"  She was in full therapist mode now I could tell it in the way she sat up a little straighter and had her full attention on me.  Giving me the confidence needed to speak my mind and know that she wasn't going to judge.  I knew this fact, yet she still did it each and everytime.  It was part of the reason her clients love her.

"They aren't just me anymore.  And it's not just some clouded memory of him made demonic by my mind.  He's using fire in them."  I looked down.  "He knows where I live now.  He's dating Stella."  Even I could hear the fear in my voice. "I saw him for real last night.  He stood in my apartment and it took everything Dorian nad not to hit Garrett."  I looked up at Margo and saw nothing on her face.  It was reassuring yet very disconcerting.  "He was making friends with Aidan and all I wanted to do was save him but I couldn't move.  I was frozen in terror and Drake felt it.  He clung to me like I was his life raft.  He was more mine."

Margo nodded.  "You have a monitor now, Nox.  If he harms you someone will know something is wrong.  Right now you are safe."

I shook my head.  "I'm not worried about me."

"Then who are you worried about?"

"Aidan, Drake, Dorian and even Stella.  He tormented me as a child.  I don't want him touching either boy and I will stop him if he tries."  I knew that was a lie.  I couldn't even move with him standing in front of me.  My body was stricken with such fear and muscle memory that I was nothing but a five year old child when he stood in my apartment.  I was terrified of him.

"We will work on that fear, Nox.  I promise you.  You can protect those boys."  Margo knew exactly what I needed to hear, knew exactly what was running through my head.  It was part of her talent afterall and why Margo Silverman was such an excellent therapist, she had the uncanny ability to read your thoughts.  It wasn't always clear or decisive, but it is what made her one of the best therapist the Venatori employed.

She stood up.  "So Nox, now that you can roam the compound what are you going to do first?"

I stood up and started walking towards to door.  "I am going to go make plans with Dorian.  And work out whatever schedule he needs of me with everything so I can plan my scehedule accordingly."

"Plans with Dorian?  And you mentioned he was here last night?  Did you not tell me something?"  Margo asked innocently.

I grinned at her and I saw the smile brighten on her face.  "It's going somewhere.  We kissed last night.  There was a misunderstanding this morning, but I think we cleared that up."

"Misunderstanding?"

I sighed.  "Our personalities mish-mashing in the wrong directions as to be expected."

"Specifically?"  Margo wanted the details and I wasn't sure if this was therapy induced or something else.

"Specifically, he didn't want the boys to know we liked men."

"What did you tell him?"  She sounded concerned.

"The truth.  They would find out someday.  What does it matter what anyone else thinks.  And if I can't be with him in the privacy of my own home, then what was the point of trying at all?  I understand where our personalities cross the line.  I would never make Dorian uncomfortable in public.  Not with public displays of affection anyway.  I can maintain proper airs.  I can't say I won't be my normal self with everything else.  My mouth is usually what brings embarassment to others."

Margo smiled.  "Yes your mouth does do a lot of damage some days.  What did Dorian say to that?"

"He said I had a point and kissed me.  Drake wasn't in the room but he gave me a much more enthusastic kiss in front of Drake as he left.  Drake isn't his son, so that's one issue.  I expect there will be issues with Aidan and Stella inparticular.  It's not like watching us will make him gay, but I'm afraid that's what she'll beleive and keep things strickly platonic between Dorian and I."

"I am so happy for you Nox.  And what of Jo - your little wolf?"

I shrugged.  "It was never about being romantic with her.  And if what LouAnn says is true and I am her Alpha we will all have to work something out.  Have you had any more chats with her."

Margo nodded.  "As a matter of fact I have.  I cannot discuss them with you.  But she has some news for you when you go to visit you."

"In one day she has news?"  I asked.

She nodded.  "We spoke again after you'd left. You made an impression on the little wolf."

I smiled.  "That's good.  Do we have our standing Monday?"

Margo nodded.  "Always.  I will see you bright and early."  She walked over to the door and I followed her.  She patted my hand.  "Things will get brighter from here on out."

I grinned.  "I hope so."
