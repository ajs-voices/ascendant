I was left alone to start working on yet another one of Dae'lin's project for me.  It was looking for patterns in a rash of killings that were all tied to one supposed vampire.  But I saw no vampire patterns in it.  But I went with it.

I was staring at a bunch of gruesome pictures looking for something that just didn't add up to me when my phone rang.  It was unknown and my heart leapt into my throat as I answered it.  I croaked out, "Hello?"

A soft sultry voice sang over the line. "Nox Sétanta?  This is Anabel Dowager, you've been trying to meet me?"

Anabel.  I smiled as my anxiety lessened, it was a call I'd been waiting for but hadn't really remembered I was supposed to get.  "Yes, ma'am I am.  I was hoping to sit down and chat with you about something important."

"At this very moment I'm free, if you can meet now."  She sounded like she was in a rush for something to happen.

I nodded but I knew she couldn't see.  "I can meet you.  Where would you like me to be?"

She gave me directions to her apartment and I agreed to meet her in 5 minutes.  The Dowagers, like the Viddens and the Vegas and 5 other families ruled our community.  Anabel wasn't first in line, but she was the only daughter of the next in line, so it was a pretty big deal that she wanted to have Dorian's children.

She lived three flights above me and I took the stairs two at a time and I was early.  STill dressed in the semi-professional wear from earlier I was thankful to be at least presentable for what I was going to offer.  I probably should have thought about brushing my teeth and shaving but I liked my always present stubble, I wasn't really trying to attract her anyway.

I knocked on her door and a small man in a dark suit answered.  "Ms. Dowager is waiting for you."  He moved asided and I stepped into the lush apartment.  Dorian's was sparse compared to this place, it was covered in growing plants, like I was stepping into a forest.  I was surprised to see such greenery in the apartment - it had to be hell to water.

The man lead me to a sitting room and a dark-haired women wearing a red cardigan and had a little red jewel in the middle of her forehead greeted me. 

"Ms. Dowager.  Mr. Sétanta is here to see you."

She looked up at me and nodded for me to sit down.  She asked me, "Tea?"

I shook my head.  "No thank you."

She smiled a perfectly straight white smile at me.  "A gentleman drinks tea."

I grinned at her.  "I'm hardly a gentleman.  Just the skinny kid looking to help out his friends."

"Are you always so honest?"  She asked.

"Why should I lie to someone who knows the truth about my life?  I tell enough lies outside the compound.  If you don't beleive me here, that's your fault."  I confided.

She nodded.  "I suppose that's a good enough reason to be blunt.  What is it you wanted to talk about."

"I want to talk about Dorian Vega."  I said quickly.

Her eye quirked up in question.  "What about him can I assist you with?  I assure you he can talk for himself."

I grinned at her.  "Oh he can and so much more."  I winked at her.  "II specifically wanted to know if you intended to continue courting Dorian for the possiblity of fathering children with you."

Her tea cup clinked against her teeth.  She was surprised and I could only grin wider at having shocked such a powerful woman.  "How is it that you know this?"

"Dorian and I are getting to know each other rather well."  

Ms. Dowager sat forward and leaned her elbows on her knee as she held the tea cup and saucer in front of her and looked at me - really looked at me.  "So you admit to relations with the man?"

I laughed.  "I have nothing to hide.  I like Dorian.  I think he likes me."

She nodded.  "Yes.  What of it?"  Her words sounded sharp, like she expected me to say something to make her stop the persuit.   

"I'd like to make a counter proposal in his stead."  Her eyebrow arched questioninly again.  "Your entire arguement for courting Dorian's line is to gain potential Scrin Magnus in your line correct?"

She nodded.  "You are correct.  What is your proposal?"  I think she was starting to understand.

"You know who I am, yes?"  She nodded but slowly, like she wasn't sure of the answer.  I continued, "I am Cesari, level 5."  She nodded knowingly.  She knew where I was going now, I could see the smile start to form as I continued on again.  "I am not Scrin, but I will give you what you want.  More than the potential magnus, I will give you potential Cesari to your line.  Dorian shouldn't be forced to have sex with a woman he has no interest in, nor make himself become interested in."

She set her tea cup on the table in front of her. "So what, you will offer me your children in return for what?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing more than you leaving Dorian alone."

"Why would you do that?"

I laughed.  "Look.  The Venatori have a lot of bullshit rules, this one hurts Dorian more than most.  I can take one for the team.  I like women.  I can do what he can't.  I save him from having to right now because you are pressuring him.  We'll find a way to make his so-called quota.  I give you what you want, I save him the hassel of having sex with a woman who he respects but will never ever like physically."

She sighed.  "And do you expect me to raise your children alone and without you?"

I shook my head emphatically, "Hell no.  I want to be part of my kids life. And I won't allow them to be raised by the community either."

"So you will raise children not of your blood line just because you find that lifestyle a hardship?"

"Yes.  I'm doing so now.  I have the guardianship of a half human, half dragon child because the parents were sentenced to death and they asked me to."

"And you agreed?  Why?"  She sounded so appalled by my actions.

"I would do it for any and every child if I could.  No one should grow up like I did.  No one!"  She'd found a trigger point for my anger.  

She stood up.  "And you will require the children to be Scrin, and not a hunter like you?"

I nodded and stood up too.  I towered over the small dark haired woman.  "I will impress upon them yes.  But I can't gurantee a child's mindset.  They will be traied as Scrin from the start, but that doesn't mean they won't want to be Venatori."

She nodded.  "Good enough.  I will notify Mr. Vega of our conclusion."

I smiled.  "We don't need a contract.  Unless you beleive I'm going to forefeit on it of course."

"Can I trust you?"  She asked cautiously.

"I wouldn't.  But in this yes you can trust me."

She shook her head.  "Alright."  She handed me her hand.  "A binding handshake it is."

I grinned as I took her hand.  "It is agreed then?"  She nodded.  "I will make myself available at your next convience moment."  I winked at her and she actually blushed.

She nodded.  "I will send you the scheduled times of our next meeting."

"Excellent."  I was chuckling to myself - timed sex - scheduling it just made me laugh.  I left with a smile and knew that Dorian was going to be angry but we'd work it out.
