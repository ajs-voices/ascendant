# Scholary Start
_Sunday, July 19, 2015 10:30 AM_

Margo left and I changed my shirt, well it wasn't exactly changing.  I left the t-shirt I'd pulled on and put on a long sleeve button up shirt so that I wasn't exactly looking like some highschooler.  I wasn't the suit and tie type like Dorian, but I could dress better than jeans and a t-shirt.  Though my choice of shirt was likely to draw as much attention as the offensive t-shirt underneath - the orange was bright, they called it hunter orange but it wasn't as neon as they wore in the woods hunting. 

I grabbed my laptop as it was the one thing I would use in all the jobs that Dae'lin had set aside for me.  First I'd go see her and see if she needed me in office or if working when I could was what she need.  Then I'd go see Dorian and Richard about the Academy stuff.  And there seemed to be a lot of that.  On my way I'd stop in to see Drake and give his teachers the envelope Margo had given me.  I was curious to see the contents but she said I didn't want to know so that was likely best.

I wasn't exactly looking forward to this whole new adventure.  Three months cooped up in the compound with very little to keep me field active.  I was likely to spend a great deal of my time in the gym.  Though I could think of a few other activities that could get the blood flowing. 

As I was walking the halls of the compound I kept thinking of things I needed to do.  I needed to arrange times to visit Lori and Jo.  And I needed to speak with Anabel Dowager.  Even needed to set arrangements up with Dae'lin.  I stopped in the hallway of some place I had managed to wander to.  "When did I become an adult?"  

I had too much on my plate.  I didn't feel anxious and that was a great feeling, but when did I start being the responsible one?  I was free to do whatever I liked and I was being smart and setting up my schedule so I could goof around around it.  My preoccupation with my time had made me become an adult.  I wasn't sure how I felt about that.

I found my way to Dae'lin's office.  I knocked on her door and she beckoned, "Come in."

I opened the door and grinned at her as she looked up at me. "So tell me, Ms. Rivera where am I to work?"

She blinked back at me.  "I'm surprised you are here."  She had to think for a few minutes, I watched as she tapped her index finger to her chin.  "You can work anywhere.  I don't need to keep tabs on you like when you were in the Acadmen do I?  You're a grown man capable of doing your job."

I nodded.  "So my hours are my own?"

"I don't see why not."  She nodded.  "I know Richard and Dorian and any other interested parties will want to get their hands on you now that you are stuck here."

"Okay.  So I work you around everyone else."  I grinned at her.  "And did you talk to Jerry?"

She asked, "About what?"

"Don't play coy, Dae'lin.  I made you a proposal and you said you would talk with Jerry."

Her mouth fell into an O shape and her tanned skin turned a pretty shade of pink.  "Oh..."  She stammered.  "I didn't ask him."

"Okay.  It's your life.  But the offer stands, at least until someone else objects."  I grinned at her.

"What's that supposed to mean?"  She sounded offended.

"It means if someone asks me to desist in my extra ciricular activities I would feel obligated to heed their request."

She laughed.  "Such big words coming from your mouth, boy.  You are implying a special someone.  That I don't beleive.  Nox SÃ©tanta having a significant other? Unheard of."

I grinned at her.  "We'll see how it goes.  But it's not that far fetched."

Dae'lin laughed.  "Yes.  Nox.  It is.  This is coming from a boy who've I caught making out with three different people on the same day."

I laughed.  I remembered that day rather well.  It was a challenge.  Jace dared me and I accepted.  How many times could I get caught with by Dae'lin or another superior.  "I am not that boy anymore Dae'lin.  I have grown up.  I'm fully capable of having a long term relationship.  I choose not to.  Choosing to let people in who could hurt me and in the past it wasn't worth the risk.  Now.  I'm taking a risk because it feels right."

Dae'lin leaned forward with interest dancing in her eyes.  "Do tell me who the lucky gal is?"

I laughed.  "Now I never said it was a gal."

"Then the lucky guy?"

I grinned playfully at Dae'lin.  "I don't kiss and tell."

"You are such a tease."  She threw a peice of wadded up paper that was sitting on her desk.

"Let me know what your answer is."  I gave Dae'lin a flourishing bow and she rolled her eyes at me.  "See ya, Dae'lin.  I've already started one of the cases you'd given me."

And that was that.  Job one works around the others.  Working with the Academy wasn't going to be as easy.  Everything was early in the day which meant I might be spending nights doing stuff for Dae'lin.  But hopefully it wasn't all the time.

The Academy was 5 floors above the main HQ offices and Dorian's office was on the second floor of that with most of the classrooms.  He was one of the few who had an office with the children.  He was a guidance counsoler of sorts.  He maintained testing schedules and advisory sessions for some children.  He got to pick and choose those now.  Back when he'd started looking after me I was assigned to him.  But he'd proven his worth over the years and was not second over the entire academy.  Richard Weston was headmaster, Dorian would likely follow him when Richard stepped down.

I took the five flights of stairs two steps at a time.  It wasn't quite as easy as I remember it being when I lived her last.  It had been a while.  I was going to have to readjust my workouts to accomdate for the stairs.  They made their own good workouts.

I walked into the Academy Offices and a bunch of ladies at their desks looked up.  It was strange seeing these women here when I wasn't in trouble.  A single red headed woman walked up to the counter that separated the walk-ins from those working there.  "Well.  Looky-here.  Isn't it our favorite trouble maker."  There was a few snorts and laughs in the background.  "What can I do you for, Nox?"

"Ms. Susan I'm here to see Richard and Dorian if they are free."  I was poliet despite the fact that I wanted to say something smart.  

"Richard and Dorian?  You don't mean Mr. Weston and Mr. Vega."  She gave me that look that said I was in trouble.

"No ma'am, I don't.  I graduated three years ago and they are now my equals.  They want me to work with or for them.  I'm here for the details."  I was getting snappy.

A graying man stuck his head out of his corner office.  He pulled his specticales down from the bridge of his nose to look over them.  "Susan, give the boy a break.  We've been expecting him.  Send for Dorian please.  Nox come on in.  We've a lot to discuss."

I winked at Susan and she blushed slightly.  I grinned back at her.  I wanted to say something embarassing but I was trying to be good.  Richard's hair was thinner than I remembered it, and much grayer too.  He wore a plaid blue vest and I bit back my retro comments that wanted to surge out of my mouth.  I was an adult.  I kept saying that to myself in my head.  I was an adult.

I sat down in one of the faded leather chairs.  I'd been in this office a time or two.  It felt odd not being in trouble.  Richard sat down and looked at me with a smile.  "Who would have thought this day would come?"

I grinned.  "What day is that, sir?"

"It's Richard, not sir.  But to answer your question, the day you are in my office of your own free will and not because there is some problem or another."

I smiled.  "Whoda thunk it.  Dae'lin told me you have some things for me to do?"

He nodded.  "Directly to the point - as usual."  He quickly stood up and walked around his desk and waved someone in.  I assumed it was Dorian.

Dorian knocked softly before opening the door.  Polite as ever.  I looked up at him from behind me.  He smiled and I couldn't help but smile back.  I was happy to see him in so many ways.  Richard took Dorian's hand and shook it firmly.  "Glad you could make it on such short notice.  I hadn't expected our friend here so soon."

I smiled at both of them.  "I'm eager to start being productive again."

Dorian added.  "I imagine being down and out paid its toll on you."

I laughed.  "You have no idea."  He probably did he'd spent a great deal of time with me over the past few months.  He probably knew better than I did.

Dorian smiled as he took the seat next to me.  Richard continued as if no one had interrupted.  "Nox.  You are correct we have some things we want you to do around the Academy.  Dorian can confer with you on the vast majority of them, as you'll be working with him for 80 percent of it."

"But I want to inquire as to whether or not you'd be interested in teaching a very young generation.  I know Dae'lin told you the age ranges.  These children are showing early signs and our track record is poor at best with children this age.  Dorian made me aware this morning that you'd already worked with Aidan Row and Drake Dragon - for lack of better full name.  I understand it you have custody of the young dragon."

I nodded.  "Yeah.  I worked with them yesterday.  I don't know if it helped but the exercises were successful, they channeled the right elements when indicated."

"Examples, patterns, everything I've seen from Dorian the past few days I don't understand, but that's why he's here.  Will you teach these children?"

I nodded.  "I have nothing better to do."  I grinned at him.  "It would be a pleasure working with kids in my general age range."

Dorian gave a curt laugh and Richard smiled.  "Your smart mouth will get you into trouble." Richard said.

I nodded.  "Yeah it does that."

"I'd like for you to help Dorian develop training methods for our testing, if we can incorporate some of these things Dorian is excited about then you just made our life a billion times simpler and hopefully better.  And if there is time I'd like to let you sit in on a few tests with instructors other than Dorian.  To see how we can improve their abilities and the test mechanics."

"Whatever you want me to work on.  Dae'lin gave me free reign of my schedule with her.  So I can work around the Academy."

Richard's broad smile was not something I was used to seeing.  I was usually in trouble.  "That sounds great.  Work with Dorian.  I will introduce you to the five children you will be teaching now.  And then you and Dorian can set to working out an arrangement."

I nodded and smiled at Dorian.  "Sounds good.  I'll meet you in your office when Richard is done with introductions."

Dorian stood up and nodded.  "I will be there."  He gave me a bright smile before he exited the office.

Richard offered me his hand.  "I look forward to seeing what you can do Nox.  Shall we?"  He extended his hand towards the door and we were out strolling past the ladies who were eyeing me suspiciously.  I was still a trouble maker in their eyes and it made me chuckle to myself.
