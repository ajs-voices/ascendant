There was a slight problem.  Now that I realized it.  If I was supposed to pick up Drake now, and I couldn't leave.  I should call my dad and have him do it.  But I didn't do it right away and I got side tracked with looking around my new place.

The guest room was my first stop and I was still disgusted by it.  It was generic.  I wondered if Dorian knew this.  I pulled my phone out of my pocket and found his name in the directory and called him.  

It rang twice before I heard him answer.  "Hello.  Dorian's phone."  It wasn't Dorian.  I was lost for words.  Some other guy was answering his phone.  I was jealous.

"Silas, what did I tell you about answering my phone?"  I heard Dorian scold the man.  Maybe it was not what I thought.  

Silas sighed, "You said not to answer it unless it was your father."

"So why did you answer it?"

Silas sounded defeated as he spoke.  "I forgot sir.  I'm sorry.  It won't happen again."

Dorian scolded him in his angry voice.  I winched as I overheard him.  "I won't remind you again Silas.  My personal phone you do not answer even if I leave it with you.  Do you understand me?"

"Yes sir."  I heard the phone exchange hands.

"I'm sorry for the delay.  May I ask who is calling?"  Dorian's voice was still tinged with anger and I hesitated. "Hello?"  he asked again.

"Sorry.  I'm here.  The angry voice is not something I like to hear."  I tried not let me anxiety show through.

"Nox?  I didn't expect to hear from you today."

"Yeah.  I told you I would call."  I gave him a mock offended tone of voice.  I knew very well what he had heard about me.

"I should know you don't lie to me.  But honestly didn't think you'd have time."

I sighed.  "I'm on house arrest so I have an empty apartment and no one to talk to.  Staying in the joint would have been preferrable to complete quiet.  So I was thinking I'm sure you've tons of questions about what you took with you yesterday - figured you'd want to talk.  I'll make food, we can eat and go over everything you've questions about.  And on the lessing of discomfort I will have a little one hanging around."  I knew adding the last would point the finger right at the tension but I wanted him to know it wasn't like a date.  I wasn't asking him out.  As much as I'd have liked that.

"So your dad told you about the little dragon who's been eager to see you since he arrived?"  Dorian sounded like he knew Drake.

"You know him?"  I asked.

Dorian's answer didn't shock me.  "Yeah.  He's in the same class as Aidan.  I expect they'll be together for a while unless you object to it of course."

"Why would I object to it?"

"Just how you feel about Venatori overseeing children is all.  It's a bit early for both boys to be learning, but they have parents who are rather not there right now."  Dorian sighed, "I'm trying to fix that but it's hard getting down to that level when he's my own son."

"You just feel guilty about it all.  He'll warm up to you.  There really is no reason for him not to."  I was speaking from experience but I didn't mention it outright.  The last thing I wanted was for Dorian to pull away farther from me.  My heart ached at the thought.  I sighed.  "I can't pick Drake up, I supose I'll have to get Kai to go for me."

"I can go."  Dorian volunteered and that surprised me.  "I'm picking Aidan up anyway for Stella.  She's got a date."

"Good for her.  And you.  I would appreciate it if you did that.  Bring them both here and I'll make kid friendly cuisine and we can have a play date and chat about patterns when they aren't distracting us with toddler things."  I was actually excited about that prospect.  It unnerved me that the whole idea sounded like fun.

The rest of my day after calling Dorian was fairly boring until there was a knock at my door.  It made me wonder who knew where I was other than my father, Dorian and Margo.  I hoped maybe it was Jace.  We could goof around till Dorian showed up.  I really hated sitting here idle.

I answered the door and was surprised to see Dae'lin.  Her short little self decked out in her business suit.  "Have some big wig meeting?"  I asked.

She nodded as I waved her inside with a flourishing bow.  She rolled her eyes at me.  "Yes.  About you actually."

"A big wig meeting about little ole me.  I'm flattered."  I wasn't really I was expecting they were taking me off active duty until further notice.

Dae'lin sat down on the couch and waited for me to join her.  So I stalled and grabbed two bottles of water from the fridge.  I'd already had a beer with my father.  And that had only been like 10am.  I didn't really need another.  

I offered Dae'lin the water and sat down on the floor, much like I had done as a kid when she would instruct me.  Mostly because I was bored and I was tired of sitting on the coushy couch.

Dae'lin rolled her eyes again and I laughed.  Which she did the same thing again and I had to bit back my comment.  She wasn't in a good mood from the look of things.

"You are to be removed from active duty until further notice.  It doesn't matter what your eval tomorrow says, they want you out of commission for at least a month.  Kinda like when a cop shoots someone for the first time."

I laughed.  "So they are treating me like I'm going to hurl myself from a building at a moments notice because I did it once?"

Dae'lin shook her head.  "That's only part of it.  With all those pschy evals you've had recently they doubt everything about your readiness to be deployed.  Your record has no kills and they are doubting you."

I rolled my eyes.  "Of course it's about that now.  So what are you going to make me do in the mean time?"

"Well, you have options.  I want you to work with us at least part time.  There are a lot of other hunters who could use your problem solving skills to narrow down their searches before they even go out in the field.  You've found every obscure mark I've sent you after even ones I didn't think possible - like your dragon.  She was hard to find since she was roaming - dragon's don't do that."

I nodded.  "I know.  Okay I can manage that.  What are my other options?"

Dae'lin smiled.  "Dorian has a lot of things he wants you to go over.  He requested you specifically.  Gary granted the access not that I'd have said no to Dorian.  He wants you to sit in on some tests, and participate in some of the evaluations of the younger children.  And I think he wants you to give him a run down on how you can read a person's ability before testing them. He has a lot of questions as I understand it."

She continued.  "And then there's the option to teach the kids like Jason is doing.  We want to create a few new courses centered around how you see things.  To be introductory courses for the kids before they ever get around to Jason's theories.  And you were such a good mentor to Levi, I'm sure they'll give you two or three kids who need your particular brand of help."

"You mean the trouble makers?"

Dae'lin laughed, it was a musical series followed by a short snort which she covered with her hand.  I couldn't help but grin up at her.  "Actually no.  You'd think that but, there are a few kids that are showing potential far earlier than we would have thought.  Aidan and Drake being two but there are three other little ones between the ages of 3 and 5 who we have to keep a tight eye on.  If you can show them how to control their ability withouth having to understand in words that would be excellent.  You teach by example and I think that will work with these kids.  So does Dorian."

"So I guess I'm supposed to split my time between all these things while I'm stuck at a desk?"  They all sounded like I something I could do and keep me busy for a time anyway.  And it would keep me here.  There was a little dragon to think about.  And if I was honest with myself, a little wolf too.

Dae'lin nodded.  "Only if you are interested.  We can stick you somewhere in the field offices but I don't think you'd be happy with a desk job.  You are far to hands on - always have been."

"Sure.  We'lll work out a schedule that fits with my needs."

Dae'lin nodded.  "Great.  I'll let Gary, Richard and Dorian know that you are game for everything suggested."  She stood up and I followed her to the door.

"Hey, Dae'lin, I'm sorry that things fell through for you and Jerry."  It was a hard thing to deal with, I knew she was angry.

"It's not your fault.  Jerry and I will figure something out."  She opened the door and started to leave.

"You know just because there isn't a contract saying I have to, I'm not opposed to helping you out.  As long as death for my children aren't on the table, I can help Dae'lin."

She turned and looked at me with those big dark eyes of hers.  I could see the thoughts churning in her mind.  "I'll talk with Jerry.  You will raise both lines still?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  If that's what you want.  And no contract needed Dae'lin.  I have to do this too ya know.  I can at least help a friend out."  Which gave me another idea.  I needed to talk to Anabel Dowager too.

"I'll discuss it with Jerry.  I'll let you know.  In the mean time.  I'll send you a few cases to look at while you are stuck here."  She smiled.  "Good luck Nox."

_Saturday, July 18, 2015 3:15 PM_

After Dae'lin left I called the number the directory had for Anabel Dowager. Unfortunately she wasn't available and I left her my name and number and asked that she call me back.  I didn't tell the person who answered why.  It wasn't any of their business and I should probably check with Dorian to even see if it's still an issue.  But it wasn't exactly a good topic to bring up.  
I started getting anxious around 3PM when I knew the academny typically let out.  Not just because Dorian was coming up, but I didn't even know this kid.  I'd met him once breiefly and that was it.  

I started a quick fix me up yoga routine to relax and found that it had helped by the time that Dorian knocked at the door.

I finished my current pose and then grabbed the towel from the couch and headed for the door wiping away any sweat that formed in the cold room of my apartment.  I hadn't realized the AC was cranked so high until that moment.

I opened the door and Dorian and two little boys stood in the hallway.  Dorian carried a bag that I had to assume was Drake's.  "Hey."  I smiled at Dorian.  I knelt down and got at the boy's level.  "Do either of you remember me?"

Aidan held his arms out like an airplane and soared past me.  I grinned.  "I take that as a yes."  Drake stared at me with big orange eyes and took me in.  He took a step closer and a deep breath in.  I smiled at him.  "Do you remember me?"  Drake didn't hesitate again as he wrapped his arms around me.  "I guess so."  I stood up and took the bag from Dorian.  "Thanks man.  I appreciate it."

"No problem, Nox.  He's a good kid.  But you will have your hands full."

I laughed.  "No doubt. And I'm sure I won't be a good influence either."

Dorian laughed as I shut the door behind him.  I set the bag down by the bar and joined the other three in the living room.  Aidan and Drake were busily laying down on the yoga mat I'd set up earlier.  Dorian looked at me and smiled, "They are easily entertained."

"We should go find a box."  It was a joke but the look Dorian gave me was price less he really hadn't been around kids much.  Made me wonder if he was always like this.  "You never played in a big box?"

Dorian shook his head.  "Come on, let's go play.  You might want to revisit your attire when you are playing with kids."  I winked at Dorian, "Not that there is anything wrong with what you wear.  Just would hate to ruin your designer clothing."

I didn't have much in the way of toys at the moment.  I didn't know what Drake had in his bag so I'd make due with what I had on hand.  My ability.

I sat down on the floor in the middle of the yoga mat, both Drake and Aidan piled on top of me trying to remove me from the mat.  It gave me a good chance to look closer at each boy.  Aidan was definitely showing signs of sparking soon.  There had been a few recorded cases of three year olds.  But they never ended well.  And with Drake standing right alone side of them both of their patterns were chaotic.

We needed to get them in control before it was too late.  No time like the present.  "Hey now.  Sit still.  Or I'll tickle you."  My threat of course was not beleived so I tickled each of the boy's bellies until they were rolling in fits of laughter trying to catch their breath.  I looked up and saw Dorian watching us with wide eyes.  I mouth, "Come sit with us."

Dorian didn't move from the couch so I turned my attention back to the sitting little balls of giggles.  I formed four orbs above my hands and both of the boys eyes went wide with curiousity.  They were absorbed in the patterns. It was almost like they knew what to do.  I started tossing them around in a circle.  I sucked at juggling but with my ability I could make it look like I was an expert at it.  They moved at a snails pace around in a circle.  "Aidan.  Drake.  Can you make a pretend yellow ball?"  

I stopped juggling the balls, each one staying in place and their eyes grew bigger.  I was preforming magic as I called attention to my hands.  "Hold the pretend yellow ball in your hands like this."  I cupped my hands and showed them how it looked without a ball in it.  I hoped that was enough incentive to work like it had with Dr. Eriksen.

They drew their hands together and did as I asked.  I started juggling again and the boys giggled.  "Toss your yellow balls to me."  I watched as their connections and their own abilities focused through the movement.  I caught two yellow balls in my circle of balls.  I'd actually created them on the fly so the boys saw them appear.  

I looked up at Dorian and he was smiling.  He knew what I was doing.  "You could do this too you know.  You aren't chaotic like them, but you could."

Dorian gave me a look that spoke volumes.  He had an inkling of what I meant.  But he slid off the couch and cupped his hands like the boys had and I saw an actual ball of air appear in his hands.  He looked down at it with surprise.  "See I told you."

Dorian tossed the ball to me and I caught it.  There were four yellow balls and 3 other balls dancing in front of me.  

Dorian continued with the insturction.  "Can we pretend to make a blue ball."  He looked up at me to make sure that was okay and I nodded.  Water was my hardest element, it was so slippery and squirmy, much like the two boys.  Dorian tried and his link wasn't quite there yet, but the patterns had formed but he couldn't hold it together.  The boys threw their pretend balls at me and the water settled into a natural pattern.  

We did the same for the red and brown balls that circled around my living room.  I'd given up on the juggling act and had them circling around everywhere by the time the boys and Dorian had tossed me the remaining 6 balls.  There were 24 colored balls floating around my living room.

Dorian smiled at me as I sat there with the boys as they climbed on my shoulders while I trying to reach each globe.  

They started chasing them around the room and I was more than happy to let them run some of their giggling out.  "I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  I'm glad you did."

I took a deep breath.  "You know you can be taught to touch all four elements at the same time, if you wanted to."

Dorian looked at me with a blank expression.  "I figured out why you are so much different than every other person.  You could touch air, naturally but so weak that you never nurtured it.  But over the years you've seen every element.  You worked to do that.  And that's really the hardest part.  You are Cesari just not one anyone has ever seen before.  You've never fluctated like those who can touch only one element at a time.  Never oscillated between elements despite being able to see them.  I never understood why.  I atributed to your being Eruditus in nature.  You control your pattern as much as you control yourself.  Really isn't too hard to beleive that you can do so much more than just see them."

Dorian shook his head.  "I don't disbeleive you Nox.  I really don't.  But you are saying I'm something we've never seen before."

"How many times have you told me I'm improbable but not impossible."

Dorian laughed.  "Too many apparently."

I grinned at him just as I heard the boys collide with one another.  I heard two tiny cries and Dorian almost jumped up.  I put my hand on his leg and didn't let him stand up.  I turned over my shoulder to look in the general direction of the thump and asked, "Are you okay?"

Two whimpering boys came over to us rubbing their heads with their hands.  I nodded, "Maybe we should sit down and watch some TV while I make us something to eat."  They scurried up on the couch and I watched as Drake jumped down and hunted down his bag and he pulled out a blanket and dragged it across the floor and curled up next to Aidan and covered them both up.  I looked at Dorian, "Can you find them something to watch.  Disney or Nickaldeon should work."

Dorian nodded and found the TV remote without any assistance.  Not that I could have helped anyway I had no idea where it was.

He flipped on Disney and there was some silly teeny bopper show on, so he flipped it to Nick.  That wasn't much better.   He looked over at me and I shrugged.  He grinned.  "Stella gave me a few movies.  I'll go get one."

"Alright, don't lock the door behind you.  Probably won't have clean hands to open the door with."  

Dorian nodded and hurried out the door.  I started prepping food.  I disliked fried food, but most kids liked chicken nuggets and frech fries.  I could manage a heathlier version of them and maybe get them to eat some veggies too.

I cut a bunch of veggies and potatoes into strips and cut chicken.  I was going to fry some and grill others.  It would be nice to have an accutal fire grill, but I could manage with what I had here.  Maybe they'd eat the non-fried food but I wasn't going to push my luck.  

By the time everything had been dipped in the beer batter and cut I was frying when Dorian came back in with the movie.  I was fairly certain the boys were sleeping since they hadn't made a single noise since he'd left.  

He leaned over the couch to check and shook his head, "You wore them out."

I guess that was a good thing but I hoped they woke up in time to actually eat something.  Dorian set the movie down on the TV stand for later.  "Seems we have some time to talk."

I grinned at him.  "What would you like to talk about?  I think there is a mirad of things out there in the ether to discuss.  Like me working for/with you."

Dorian took a seat across the bar on one of the barstools.  "You might want to consider different stools if you intend this for your main entertainment center."  Dorian readjusted his sitting posture.  "It's a bit tough on the back with no back to the stool."

I grinned, "You picked it out."

He blushed slight.  "I figured a more bar like appearance would be your taste, but I should have sat in them first."

I laughed.  "That will teach you then."

"I take it Dae'lin has informed you of our request then."

I nodded.  "Yep.  She even said you'd asked for me personally.  I assume you want to pick my brain for what you currently do?"

"You assume correctly."  Dorian nodded.  "I think if you can show me how to read the patterns like you do, we can get a better assessment of a person before we even test them.  It could eliminate a great deal of the tests."

"Whatever you want Dorian.  I'll try.  It's hard to explain.  But I'll start with drawing out each one for you."

Dorian nodded.  "That sounds like a good start."

I started frying things in a deep pan.  It was a waste of oil and food if you asked me but it was for kids.  How was I going to cook for Drake every night if I had to eat like this.  I was going to have to figure out what he'd eat that I'd eat.  I could feel the anxiety levels rising at switching things up.

I took a deep breath and finished what I was doing.  

Dorian took pity on me.  "You know I'm sure everyone would have been fine without the fried food."

I looked up at him with mock disgust.  "No you tell me."  I grinned at him  "I'll be fine.  I just hope I can find something Drake will eat that isn't like this every night.  I don't think I could manage it."

Dorian chuckled at me, "You'd have to work out ten times harder to keep that figure."

I spun a circle.  "And I'd hate to lose this."  I was being oddly flamboyout in his presence and I felt like the stereotypical gay guy on television, all bring neon and limp hand in the air.  I chuckled at my self.  "Okay.  Let's not do that again."

Dorian outright laughed at me.  I stuck my tongue out at him.  I know it was childish and he just laughed that much harder.  A small head poked up over the edge of the couch and I laughed.  "You woke them up."

Dorian turned around and saw both head poking up.  "That's alright it's almost time to eat anyway, right?"

I nodded.  Both boys crawled down from the couch and Dorian helped them up into a chair.  He was right, we were going to have to rethink eating arrangments.  Both boys sat percariously on the edge of the bar stool.  I smiled.  "Maybe we should make a picnic of it?"

Dorian looked at me with a smile.  "That's a good idea.  I'll get a blanket while you finish up."

I grinned at him, "You know where they are I'm sure."

He smiled back at me and I watched the man leave.  I bit my bottom lip and had to turn back to what I was doing.  He was distracting in every fashion and I the only way I stopped thinking like that was when we were distracted with other things - like the boys.

The last batch finished frying and I pulled it out and placed it to drain.  I didn't know what else we had to go with it.  I pulled out the milk for the boys.  That seemed a good drink for them.  And then I wondered what level of cups they had.  I sighed.  I had so much to learn and I hadn't even prepared for a toddler in my home.  

Dorian came back with an orange blanket.  I laughed.  "Do you like loud and obnoxious colors Dorian?"

He shook his head.  "No but you do."

I grinned "Underneath the black comforter in my room are my sheets orange?  Did you decorate my bed in halloween colors?"

Dorian took a moment and thought about it.  "Yeah.  Sorry.  I did do that.  Too much?"

I shook my head.  "No we can do something with the comforter I'm sure."  

Dorian nodded.

Dorian flopped the orange blanket on the floor and helped the boys climb down.  They started rolling around on the blanket much like they had the yoga mat earlier.  I asked Dorian.  "Do they have special cups?"

Dorian nodded. "Aidan does.  I think there are two in Drake's bag.  Let me look." He started looking through Drakes bag and pulled out two cups with lids and straws.  "Seems we've a bit to learn about kids."

I nodded.  "A bit."  I definitely wasn't ready to be looking out for a little person and yet I was going to have to man up and be a father.  As if I had any role models for that growing up.  The one male figure in my life growing was just as clueless as I was.  How ironic.

I served everything on a platter instead of individual plates with some dipping sauces.  The boys got milk and I poured Dorian a glass of white wine and I had a beer.  

We ate with relatively little issue.  Aidan spilled Dorian's wine all over the blanket and Dorian felt aweful.  I laughed.  "Dude, I told you not to wear good clothes."

He smiled, "Noted."
