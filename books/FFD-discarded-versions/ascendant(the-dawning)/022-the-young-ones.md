# The Young Ones
_Sunday, July 19, 2015 10:30 AM_

We went downstairs to the lower level classrooms.  They had more room down there and didn't bother the rest of the children in the Acamdey, it also served as a Daycare for all the Venatori children who's parents worked in the building.  And even other humans who did as well.  

There were several kids broken out into different classrooms.  Richard stopped in front of an orange door and my anxiety level spiked.  I could feel my heart race and my palms begin to sweat.  If I had to do this everyday I was going to be wreck every night.  "They aren't all firestarters."  Richard started.  "We keep them in here just in case they are.  We'd have to have any issues."

I nodded but I really couldn't say much.  Richard opened the room and a sight I had seen m entire life stared me in the face.  The brown eyes of my nightly tormentor stared me in the face.  Garrett smiled at me, then turned to Richard.  "Just dropping the little man off."

I was frozen in place as Garrett left the room.  I could have sworn I saw joy at my terror on his face.  "Come on in, Nox."

I blinked.  I hadn't realized I was watching Garrett move down the hall.  Richard caught my nervousness.  "He's not into men.  He's dating one of the mothers here."

I blinked again.  "Yeah.  I know I found that out last night when Aidan's and his father were over having a play date."

Richard took a second look at me.  "You and Dorian were hanging out?  I'm surprised."

I shrugged.  "I asked him over to discuss more about what he'd been grilling me on and he had Aidan and I had Drake so we ended up playing with them more than actually getting any work done."

Richard laughed.  "Yes that sounds like parenthood.  Come on in, let's meet the little ones you'll be teaching tomorrow.  Any time you prefer?"

I shrugged again.  "Whatever is their best attention span time.  Morning is likely best.  Though Mondays I'm booked from 9:30 to 10:30."

Richard nodded.  "Even after you've been cleared you are still seeing Dr. Silverman.  That says a lot about you."

"What does it say exactly?" I asked.

"That you want to stay on top of your ailments and that you see the help that therapy has given you."  He intoned as if it were obvious.

"I'm sure it has nothing at all to do with my ailments making it easier to keep seeing her instead of wanting to."  I grinned at him.  "But yes, she is most helpful and I do need the help as well as the normalcy of my schedule."

Richard laughed.  "You always have to add sarcasm.  You will be an interesting fewllow in our community here."

I grinned.  Richard lead the way to the table where 5 little kids sat coloring nicely.  Richard nodded towards the teacher.  "This will be your teacher's aid, Ms. Helen.  She is in charge of the day to day things, but she will be available to help you while you are here every weekday from 10 am to noon?"  

"That's sounds fair."  I offered my hand to Ms. Helen and she took it softly in her own.  I lifted it to my lips and smiled before laying a soft kiss against her middle knuckle.  "A pleasure."

Richard rolled his eyes.  "And always the charmer.  You have not changed a bit."

"Why would I?  Everyone loves me the way I am."

Richard laughed and knelt down next to the table.  The children looked at him.  And he stood up.  "Everyone I'd like to meet your new teacher."  He put his arm around my back and I felt the raise in my blod pressure, I didn't really like someone touching my back.  I swallowed back the bile that started to rise and held my tongue as Richard continued without ever noticing my discomfort.  "This is Mr. Nox.  He is going to show you some interesting things while you are here.  Can you all say hi to him."

The group of children all chimed in "Hi, Mr. Nox."  

I grinned.  "Hi.  What are your names?"  I asked as I knelt down to be at their level.

Drake was of course first.  "You know me."

I smiled.  "Yes, Drake, I know you."

Aidan chimed in, "Me too."

"Yeah you too Aidan.  I know you too."  

A little girl with fine strawberry blonde hid behind her hands as she spoke.  "Rhiana."

I pulled a little finger down and she peaked through the other hand.  I shook her hand firmly with a smile.  "It's a pleasure too meet you Rhiana."  I kissed her knuckle as I had Ms. Helen and she giggled.  I smiled.

The boy to my left sat in his chair and colored angryly.  I looked at him.  "What's your name?"

"Henry."  He clasped his hands together.  "I don't want you to kiss my hand."

I smiled.  "That's okay, Henry.  It's still a pleasure to meet you too."

The last boy's hands started flying around in patterns.  It took me a moment to realiz that he was singing to me.  Ms. Helen translated.  "My name is Joey.  You don't wobble."  She looked down at me.  "I don't know if I translated that right."

I smiled.  I spoke to Ms. Helen but I explained to the children.  "He sees patterns around me.  He noticed mine don't oscillate like everyone elses does."

Joey smiled at me.  "You read lips?"  I asked him.

He nodded and I smiled.  "You will need to teach me how to understand you without Ms. Helen alright?"

I stood up and sat down on the circular carpet.  I looked up at Richard, "Can I stay a little while."

He nodded.  "Of course.  You officially start Monday, but I don't see why you can't start today."

I smiled.  "I just want to get to know them a little before I go see Dorian."

Richard nodded.  "That's acceptable.  I will inform Dorian you'll be a little later than planned."

"Thanks." I turned to the children.  "You guys want to play a game with me?"

They all got up from their chairs and rushed over to me happily as Richard left the small room.  All except Henry.   "You don't want to play with us, Henry?"  He shook his head and crossed his arms and stared in the opposite direction.  "Okay.  You can join us anytime you want to."

"Sit down in a circle."  After everyone complied.  "I'm going to ask you a question.  And whoever has the ball gets to answer it.  Then you can toss it to someone who hasn't answered the question.  The last person tosses it to me.  Try to answer as fast as you can."

Everyone nodded.  "How old are you?"  

Rhiana asked, "Where is the ball?  I"ll go get one."

I put my hand on her knee, "That's okay I'm going to make one.  Watch me."  I wove a pattern of air and fire to make a glowing ball that was cool to the touch.  The kids eyes went wide as the ball finally took shape.  I held the ball in both hands and then I tossed it to Aidan across from me.  "How old are you Aidan?"

"Free."  

I grinned.  "Three it is.  Throw it to someone else."

He tossed the glowing ball to Rhiana.  She sand in a sweet sing-song voice, "I'm five.  I'm the oldest."

I nodded.  "That's good to know."  She tossed the ball to Joey.  He held up five fingers.  "Well done Joey.  You are five too."

Rhiana giggled.  "I was born three minutes before Joey."

Joey signed something.  Ms. Helen translated.  "She's my sister."

I laughed.  "Awesome.  Twins.  That is good to know."

Joey tossed the ball to Drake and he grinned at me.  "Four."  As soon as the words were out of his mouth he tossed me the ball.

"Excellent.  I'm 21 right now.  In a few months I'll be 22."  I pretended to think of the next question by tapping my finger to my chin.  "What shall I ask next?"  I smiled.  "What is your favorite thing to do?"

I tossed the ball to Joey.  He gave me a flourish of signs and I thought I really needed to learn sign language asap.  Ms. Helen translated.  "I like to play on the swings."

He tossed the ball to his sister.  "I like playing with my big sister's dolls."

Aidan was next, "My cars and trucks."

Drake had the ball next and he just shrugged.  "I don't have any toys."  He perked up as he looked at me, "But I like playing wif you."

I grinned as he tossed the ball back to me.  "I like playing with you too.  My favorite thing to do is hang out with my friends.  So hanging out here is one of my favorite things to do."  

They all giggled and clapped.  I asked several more questions as we tossed the ball back and forth.  I kept an eye on Henry, after several questions that were silly and the kids all were laughing in fits of giggles by the end of the round Henry was watching us with curiousity.  "Last round.  Then I have to go."  I tossed the ball the Henry and he caught it.  "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

Henry looked at me with suspcion.  I smiled and answered my own question.  "When I grow up I want to be a great hunter."

Henry grinned, "Me too.  My daddy is a hunter.  I want to be like my Daddy."

"That Henry is a great thing to want to be."   I smiled at him.  "Toss the ball to someone else."

We went around each one saying they wanted to be like their parents except for Drake.  He wanted to be like me.  Which I could only hope was just a phase.  I didn't want him to be anything like me. 

I stood up and Ms. Helen walked over towards us.  I looked down.  "I will be back tomorrow at 10am and we'll start working on some stuff okay?"

All five heads nodded.  I patted each of the kids on the head and every one of them hugged my legs.  Aidan and Drake giggling as they did.  Rhiana smiled up at me with bright blue eyes.  Joey signed at me.  Ms. Helen translated, "He said he can't wait to see you tomorrow."

"Ditto Joey.  I will look at learning ASL tonight so I can understand you."  He grinned at me.  

I looked at Ms. Helen and handed her the envelope I'd been holding on to.  "This is from Dr. Silverman in reference to my guardianship."

She smiled at me.  "There really was no need.  Not after I saw this.  I would have vouched for you."

"Thanks.  But this will be better.  One visit isn't going to mean anything."  And I knew that from my own personal experiences.  I bid everyone good-bye with a flourishing bow and I received a smattering of giggles from the children as I headed out the door.  I got to go up and see Dorian now.  I glanced at the time on my phone and wondered if Dorian was hungry. I was, I'd eaten very early this morning.
