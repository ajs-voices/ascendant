# Boyfriend
_Tuesday, July 21, 2015 6:40 AM_

I slept straight until my alarm sounded at 4am.  Dorian's arm was still wrapped around me and I was wrapped around him.  I pulled away from him and he barely stirred.  Not a morning person I gathered.

I got dressed and went for a run.  I could have gone to the gym or done any number of things, but a run would allow me to stop by my own place and put on fresh clothes and still make it back to Dorian's place before he woke up.

I was being as quiet as I could while attempting to find things in the dim light of the countertop overhead lights.  I heard Dorian's boyfriend stirring and I tried not to make much more noise now that all the pans were out.  Dorian's fridge was stocked with only items I had ever used for him.  He had intended me to spend the night and make him breakfast.

As I was setting the eggs on the counter I saw the blonde blue eyed best friend/boyfriend of my would be lover sit down in a chair at the bar with a sheet wrapped around his shoulders.  "You had to make coffee."

I laughed softly and pulled out an earbud so I could hear him as I poured him and myself a cup of coffee.  "I assume black is fine."

Todd nodded.  "Ayup.  We aren't exactly the gourmet types."

I grinned at him as I pushed the large cup to him from across the bar. I sipped at my coffee.  "It really is the best way to drink it."

Todd nodded as he drank down a scorching gulp.  "Ow."  He said before taking another sip carefully.

"How long have you been up?  You look like you've showered and changed already."  He asked.

"I've been up since 4am. I went for a run too."  I started chopping vegetables and some pancetta.  I intended to make a fratta it would go farther and be simple enough to cook. And it was a staple in my repoitoire of cooking.

Todd glared at me over his cup.  "You will kill Dorian you know; geting up at the crack of dawn like that."

I grinned.  "He barely noticed my alarm went off."

"Why for the ever loving gods to you get up so damned early?"

I shrugged.  "Normally, I'm up before my alarm goes off.  I've usually eaten breakfast and showered before 4am.  That includes my morning workout."

"What the fuck man!"

I gave him a half smile as I started beating eggs.  "When your nightmares wake you for the upteenth time that night it's about time to get up."

He shook his head as he set the cup down and eyed the coffee pot.  "Those are some nightmares then."

I grabbed the pot and poured Todd another cup of coffee.  "You have no idea.  When I'm around Dorian, the dreams aren't as bad.  The first time I slept on his couch I slept until the sun came up.  I've not done that in years."

"That's a horrible couch to sleep on.  Why weren't you in bed with him?"

I laughed.  "Wasn't by choice.  I fell asleep watching a movie, Dorain didn't want to wake me."

"Sounds very Dorian."  Todd sighed. "Look Nox.  I'm sorry about my comment about your past.  I knew Dorian was touchy about it.  I only said it to poke a little fun at my friend.  And for whatever it's worth, I don't think I've ever seen him with a guy that he would willingly touch in front of me - ever."

"What do you mean?"  

I started stirring the rest of the ingredients together as Todd answered my question.  "Dorian's not much on the public displays of affection.  I'm sure you've noticed that.  He's not exactly one to bring his boyfriends home in the off chance I might be here."

I snorted my assention to that.  Todd shook his head.  "I assume that he told you much the same.  No boys home.  I don't know why he brought you home the first night.  But whatever you've done or are doing Nox - keep doing it.  Dorian is perpetually afraid of being alone..."

I interupted, "Dorian's not afraid of being alone.  He's afraid of not being needed.  You don't need him anymore.  He's terrified of being a father, but that's one place he'll always be needed."

"You know him well."

I shook my head.  "No.  Not well at all.  I just know why I work for him.  I need him.  He feels it, he's known it for a while.  He's seen it.  I need someone to keep me safe, to make me feel secure.  I know what I need for a relationship to work.  Took me years to get it through my thick head as my therapist says.  And the only way two near complete strangers work is if they compliment one another.  I need something Dorian can provide me.  And for him it's nothing more than doing what he's done my whole life.  With an added bonus."

Todd nearly choked on his coffee.  "Added bonus.  Which I apparently interrputed from the conversation he and I had before you walked out."  Todd laughed nervously, "And I do apologize for kissing your boyfriend.  If mine found out I'm sure he'd not be too pleased either."  He looked down at his cup.  "Can I ask you a personal question?"

I shrugged.  "Why not?"

Todd swished the coffee in his cup and took a swallow as he worked up the nerve to ask the personal question.  "Was it difficult for you being gay in the Academy?"

I laughed.  "I'm not gay."

Todd looked up at me with confusion.  I laughed some more.  "My first crush was a boy.  My first sexual encounter was with a girl.  I am equally fond of either sex though if I'm honest with myself, which I try to be in all ways, I am a bit more fond of men than women."

"You like talking about yourself don't you?"

I laughed.  "You tell me what egotistical bastard who doesn't and I'll give you a million bucks."

"You don't think highly of yourself do you?"  Todd asked.

"On the contrary I think rather highly of myself.  If you don't beleive me ask around."

Todd laughed.  

"Honestly, I'm not all I pretend to be.  I know who I am.  I know what people expect of me.  If I want to be who I am, I give them what they want to see so that when my normally strange behavior kicks in they think nothing of it.  I'm an asshole on purpose.  I spout shit to get in trouble.  And I probably started more fights as a kid with my mouth than I care to imagine.  I'm excentric at best, the odd-man-out at the worst.  And either way I don't care."

"And so very not Dorian."  Todd chuckled.  "You had to be a passing fling that turned into more."

I sighed and nodded.  "So I've been told.  Though I'm a little undersold on the whole turned into more at the moment."

Todd nodded.  "I can imagine.  Finding out your boyfriend lives with his bestfriend/lover of however long ago is a hard hit to take.  But honestly would you still be here if he had told you straight out of the gate?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I know I wouldn't.  I'd have fucked him and left him the night I found out.  I'd have treated him like any other man or woamn I had any remote feelings for.  But I'm invested in this now.  I gave him more than I've given anyone - ever; and I need him.  If I tell him how I feel he'll up and run.  Dorian Vega with some shit little kid - yeah so not his image."

Todd laughed.  "You make him sound like he's picky or that he's got such high standards that you don't rate."

"Have you actually see Dorian out there?  Perfectly pressed image.  His hair is never out of place.  He never raises his voice.  He is perfection in everything.  He's the one the teachers tell you to strive to be like.  The one every student knows because he is in charge of your testing.  You know Dorian Vega, and yet you don't see shit of the man he truly is.  The brilliance behind his deception, the humor in his step when he doesn't want anyone to see.  I'm only now beginning to scratch the surface of the man in the other room.  You.  You've known that man your entire life.  He's an open book for you."

"You seem to know him pretty well if you ask me."  He nodded in the direction of the hallway.

I laughed.  "I know he's standing there. He's been there since you asked me if I'd still be here."

Todd looked back at Dorian and then back at me.  "And you still kept talking?  why?"

I shrugged.  "I don't intend to hide anything from Dorian.  You asked, he was standing there so I answered."

I poured a third cup of coffee and set it on the bar.  I checked on the fritta in the oven to check on the top.  Dorian ignored the coffee and wrapped his arms around my waist and hugged me, "You getting along?"

I nodded as I leaned back agaisnt Dorian to wait the remaining few moments for the egg top to finish.  "We are gossiping like little girls.  All about you."

He grinned against my cheek, "Anything good?"

I turned and faced Dorian.  "You pretty much heard it all."

He leaned in and kissed me.  "So sleep okay last night?"

I nodded and turned back around to open the oven as it beeped at me.  "Best I've ever slept.  My alarm went off and everything."

Dorian chuckled and picked up the coffee on the bar.  "Did I even notice?"

I shook my head.  "Not really, you grumbled when I crawled away from you but that was it."  I set the hot pan on the cutting board and dished out six portions.  It could feed two more but I'd not tell anyone that.

Todd looked at me as I put a plate in front of him and where Dorian sat down.  "He cooks too?"

Dorian nodded with his mouth full.  I answered for him.  "I told you my strange behaviors appear normal if you put me all together in one big lump."

Dorian chuckled.  "He's one of those fit freaks and health nuts on top of his OCPD."  

I grinned at Dorian knowing he was poking fun at my expense.  I finished my plate quickly while Dorian insulted me then stuck my tongue out at him playfully.  He raised an eyebrow and waggled a finger at me.  "Don't make me come over there."

I chuckled and really wanted to make Dorian do what he told me not to.  But I had to go wake a 4 year old and my father up.  I found the tin foil and wrapped the two remaining plates up and set them aside.

Todd looked at me, "You have a date?"

Dorian grinned.  "Actually he does.  With his son and father.  If he donsn't get down there Drake will never make it to his class on time."

Todd looked shocked.  "**He** has a son?"

I laughed.  "I'm his legal guardian.  His parents as their last wish before their execution asked that I take care of him.  So I do."

"What kinda person gets killed with a kid in tow?"  Todd was clearly oblivous to the ways of the Venatori.

"The ones who break our laws."  I wanted to say duh, like he should know that answer, but he was brainiac he probably hadn't paid that much attention.  

"What did they do to warrent such a harsh punishment?"

Dorian waved me off from answering.  "Go pick take care of Drake."  He stood up and wrapped his arms around me.  "I'm sorry about last night, all of it."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Only one bit is truly worth being sorry about, the rest is all Dorian and I ..."  I stopped what I was going to say and Dorian looked at me with curiousity.  I could see the question forming on his lips.  He wanted to know what I was going to say.  But I wasn't ready to say it.  And I don't think he was either.  Instead I leaned in and kissed him.  "I can deal with anything Dorian."

He hummed against me as I pulled away and asked me, "Do you have to go?"

I nodded.  "Yep.  See you at 2."

Dorian pouted, it was playful and cute but he wasn't going to get his way this time.  I had to get a four year old to class.  He asked in a sad voice, "No lunch?"

I shook my head.  "You have your other boyfriend to take out."  I grinned at him playfully and there was a spark in his eye as he watched me turn.  I felt his eyes on me as I picked up the tin foil packets and headed out his front door.
