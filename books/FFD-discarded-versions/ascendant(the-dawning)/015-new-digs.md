# New Digs

We were on the same level as Dorian lived.  Which meant my status was equal with his at the minimum.  Single childless men living on this level of the residency was pretty unheard of.  Special came to mind.  I knew why Dorian was special.  He'd worked hard to get here.  He'd made a name for him around the world on Cesari and patterns specific to identifying children and adults who where Magnus.  He studied patterns in order to understand Cesari.  Or that's what he told me long ago when I asked him why he cared how I did things after a test.  I didn't recall which test but it didn't matter Dorian had adminstered them all to me.  And that was yet another reminder that Dorian would never see me as more than that.  I sighed and my father glanced at me.

"Sorry son."  He patted me on the shoulder and handed me a set of keys.  "Your new room."  He tapped the door.  I studied the number and the location.  I wasn't exactly sure where we were in relation to Dorian's room.  I had only been there once.  My father also lived on this level but he had children.  Kai nodded.  "Two cooridors down to the left is the gym."

He knew what I was trying to figure out and I nodded as I slide the key into the doorknob.  The key turned nicely and I pushed open the door.  I was surprised by the layout and actually how big it was at first glance.

Kai nodded towards the lightswitch and I flipped them on.  He started rattling off the specs of the house.  "Two bedroom, two bath."   He pointed to the left and we walked into the kitchen.  Stainless steel appliances and a dish washer on top of the fridge and stove.  I noticed a distinct lack of a microwave.  "Margo gave us some specifications about your habits.  Which included the idea that microwaves were the devil?"

I laughed.  "That was a joke.  I was quoting from the Water Boy where Adam Sandler's charater's momma always says everything is the devil in a gruff southern accent.  But no I don't particularly like them they make a person lazy."

Kai handed me my phone.  "And this doesn't?"

"How is that going to make me lazy?"  I took my phone and slide it into my back pocket.

Kai shook his head.  "I don't know but technology tends to do that."

"My phone if anything helps me be a more productive and sane person.  My schedule is at my fingertips without having to carry a huge planner.  I can plan to my hearts content every second if I waned to with my phone's planner and it wouldn't get any heavier or lighter.  It keeps track of how many miles I run or walk.  It tells me where to go without having to look at cumbersome maps that I can never fold back the right way."  I grinned at my father.  "A microwave pours microwaves into your food to _cook_ it.  I think I'd rather just use heat to do that.  It feels more natural."

Kai laughed.  "You are not my son in that."

I shrugged.  "Wasn't raised by anyone.  I was raised by my anxiety, obsessions and compulsions.  I do what I do to cage that beast so I can live my life like a normal person.  It could be worse.  Margo has one PSTD guy who refuses to leave his house out of paranoia somethings after him.  Margo has to go to him."

Kai sat down on a barstool.  "So you have PSTD from?"

I looked down at the counter between us.  "You know that answer already."

Kai looked up.  "This the childhood event I was told not to ever bring up?"

"Margo tell you not to bring it up?"  Kai nodded.  "It's alright.  You already know so there is no harm in talking about it.  I would think Margo would want me to talk about it."

Kai smiled at me and nodded towards the fridge, "Get your old man a beer."  

I looked at him with glee then turned towards the fridge.  I noticed the ice maker in the door and the bottom drawer freezer.  It wasn't a cheap fridge.  It seemed there were few things skimped.  I open the fridge and found a fully stocked assortmant of things I needed.  "Margo gave us a list of things you ate, we got a weeks supply."  Kai added as I pulled two beer bottles.  I almost swooned.  

"How told you about the beer?"

Kai grinned, "Who do you think?"

"Jace."  

Kai smiled, "Actually it was Dorian.  His photographic memory came in handy when it came to some things."

I frowned, "He's the part of us who helped here?"

Kai nodded, "That a problem?"

I shook my head.  "No.  Just confusing."

"Why is it confusing?  He's the closest thing you've ever had to a father.  He knows you well.  What's confusing about that."  Kai sounded so innocent in his forgetfulness.

I poped the lid on my beer with too much force and the lid flew over the bar into the living room.  "Because Dad.  I **like** Dorian.  He keeps sending mixed signals and I'm completely and utterly confused by what I want."

As I rounded the bar into the kitchen I saw my father frown.  I laughed, "You thought that was only a phase.  That once I found a girl I liked I'd be golden?"

Kai sighed, "A man can hope."

"Look Dad.  I like men. **A lot.**  If you made me choose between the two I'd likely choose the one you didn't want me to.  And not just because I know it would annoy you.  I truly do like men.  It's not a phase.  It's not an act.  I don't put on my game face and pretend to like men.  I may pretend to be more 'gay' than I actually am.  But that's just to piss people off and make them uncomfortable."  

Kai shook his head and laughed.  "That's pretty much what Nick's been telling me his whole life.  I still blame you, you know."

I grinned at him as I tossed the lid into the trash can I found underneath the sink nice and hidden away.  I was so impressed with my new kitchen.  "I know.  Nick told me.  But you do know I wasn't the first boy Nick kissed.  I wasn't even the first boy he wanted to do more with."

Kai covered his ears, "I don't want to hear this."  

I laughed.  "Oh come on Dad.  Let's talk about sex.  We never had that talk."

Kai shook his head.  "Let's not.  Do you want to see the rest of the place?"

I shrugged.  "Sure why not."  

Kai lead me into an adjoining room.  "This is your dinning room.  Margo and Dorian both agreed that you didn't need one so we changed the light and left it empty you can change it around if you want."  Kai pointed to the entrance into the kitchen.  "That one is easy enough to block off so you can make this it's own room proper.  And we can replace the one to the hallway with a real door instead of a pocket door."

He went into the hallway.  "Your living room is that way which you've already seen."  

He opened up two doors opposite one another.  "Guest bedroom to the left and bathroom to the right."  He started down the hall as I glanced into each room.  The guest room was painted a neutral color.  I hated that beign color it was going to have to change.  Kai added, "It would do for a room for Drake."

"Say what?"  I asked.  Drake, the dragon boy from before this whole thing started?   I think that was his name.

Kai laughed.  "So much to fill you in on.  Let's finish the tour first."

"Alright."  I could hear the question in my voice.

Kai took me down the hall to my own room.  It was a little larger than Dorian's had been but that could just be the fullsized bed instead of something larger like the King Dorian had.  "Your room.  Walk in closet to the left of the door and bathroom to the right."  I didn't so much as care about the closet.  I'm sure I could eventually fill it but right now wasn't likely.  I went into the bathroom and saw it was grand.  I don't mean like large, the decor was spa like.

I saw my bags sitting on the bed and the little potted snake plant Dorian had brought me was sitting on the bedside table.  I laughed.  "Alright who picked out the decor?"

Kai shook his head.  "Not me.  Dorian was the one to do all that.  Margo didn't think my taste would fit yours.  And Dorian's taste is greater than your's according to Margo so we asked him to figure out the details."

"So everything in my apartment was chosen by Dorian.  The colors, the paint, the furinture?"

Kai nodded.  "I'm sorry.  I wouldn't have gone with Margo's suggestion if it would cause you a problem."

"No.  It's not a problem.  There is nothing here I don't like.  Dorian has good taste."  It would just remind me of him every time I looked at things.  Just what I needed.  I walked out of the bedroom and to the living room.  

Kai headed for the closed door in the living room.  "And this is your study.  Well that's what it was intended as but we didn't put in anything.  We didn't know what you'd want to do with the space.  Another bedroom, a study, a small weight room.  We just didn't know."

I nodded and sat down on the couch.  I was surprised to find myself sinking into the leather.  It was oddly comforting.  "I'll figure it out.  What's this about Drake?"

Kai sat down on the couch next to me, I felt a little jostle as he too sank into the back of the couch.  He looked at the flat screen tv on the wall.  I wondered if Dorian had picked that out as well.  I didn't watch a lot of television.  There usually wasn't much time left in the day.  

Kai started.  "Drake is the little half dragon boy you brought back with his bank robber parents.  The human father was sent to Denver PD gift wrapped with a report that said Naomi was under investigation by a federal agency or something like that.  He's going down for all of it.  Naomi was here in New York until her sentencing.  She's been laid to rest."

I sighed.  "So the boy is without mother and father?"

Kai nodded.  "Naomi only had one request before she pleaded guilty and was sentenced with immediate execution."

I looked at my father expectantly.  He sighed.  "I'm sorry you brought her in only to die.  Her only request was that the boy who brought her in be given full custody of her son."

"So I'm the boy's guardian now?"  

"Yes and no.  At least not yet.  You were in a coma when the request came in.  And he's been in Venatori care since you brought him in.  You have to sign the paperwork and then you'll be the boy's guardian."

"So I've got to be father and mother to a little boy who could possibly hate me for losing his parents the way he did."

Kai nodded.  "Yeah.  But I don't think the boy will care.  From the report of the Boulder base, the boy screamed and cried for hours as soon as you left."

"So I'm a dragon's comfort as well as a wolfs. How did I get to be so lucky?"  I could hear the sarcasm dripping from my own voice.

Kai laughed.  "The paper work is on the counter.  If you sign it.  You can pick him up this afternoon after his lessons."  He stood up and brought me the paperwork with a pen.

I glanced through it and shrugged.  "I'll assume you've read them and it's all good?"

Kai nodded.  "Myself, Margo, Dorian, Emilio and Emilio's lawyer friend have all taken a look at it and it's all legit."

I sighed then signed my name to the document.  I was going to have sole custody of a child I didn't know how to raise.  I had the trust of a wolf pup and she didn't want my help.  I seemed to be collecting innocents to protect.  

My father took the papers from me.  "I'll let you settle in.  Tomorrow I'll come by and we'll take you to Margo's office and you'll get your out patient orders and such and then we can see about getting you back to work.  Until then I was advised to tell you not to leave the apartment."

I sighed.  "House arrest?"

"For the night."

I sighed.  "Alright.  They do realize that it will be very tempting to see if I can leave right?"

Kai nodded.  "Yes.  It's a test, Nox.  Stay in your apartment.  Be good and maybe they will let you out of the confinement."

"Whatever.  I'm not a danger to anyone."

Kai sighed.  "I know that.  You know that.  Everyone who knows you knows that.  But someone high up wants to keep track of you.  We'll figure it out soon enough, but for now just play their game.  Alright?"

"Yes sir."  I nodded and Kai patted me on the shoulder.

"I will see you tomorrow then son."  And he left closing and locking the door behind him.  I was left alone in my new place and everything seemed too quiet.
