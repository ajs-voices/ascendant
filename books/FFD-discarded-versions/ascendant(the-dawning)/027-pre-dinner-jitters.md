# Pre-dinner Jitters
_Monday, July 20, 2015 12:15 PM_

Entertaining for lunch was not exactly my normal plan but any time I spent with Dorian was good for me.  I hoped he didn't mind left overs.  It was good left overs and he really didn't need to know it was what Drake and I had for dinner the night before.  

I let Dorian into my apartment and watched him as he moved fluidly through my entrance to the kitchen to wash his hands.  He turned to me with a soft smile.  "What can I do to help?"

I grinned at him.  "Sit down and look pretty?"  He gave me that look that said he was begin serious.  "Really, I'm good.  I like cooking, and cooking for you.  Well, that I want to do."  He still looked at me like he wasn't going to back down.  His blue eyes sparkling with humor and a smile that told me he knew I could put him to work if I really wanted to.  I chuckled at him.  "You can get the stuff out of the fridge, steak's already been cooked and the roasted veggies too.  We'll have a heafty salad after we get these warming up."

I watched as Dorian nodded and headed for the fridge.  I could have watched him do more but I washed my hands and started pulling out a pan and utensiles to start using.  I even pulled out two knives and cutting mats.  Figure if Dorian really wanted to help he could cut the leaf vegetables too since I wasn't going to flip out over thickness and such of a leaf.  "You can get the salad fixings out and actually start chopping them while I get this going."

Dorian nodded and started working.  I wanted to watch him, but I had to pay attention or I might lose a finger or something.  Dorian set the cold vegetables down in front of him and started chopping the various leafy vegetables.  I didn't really pay much attention to what I bought as long as it looked fresh I was okay with it.

I chopped the steak and root vegetables and start sauting them in the pan with a little more fresh marniade from last night and  it would make for a good dressing on top too.

Dorian and I worked in relative silence.  Dorian laughed, "I do miss watching you dance around though."

I laughed.  "I've done that once and only because I was alone."

Dorian grinned.  "It was a nice show."

I winked at him.  "Maybe again some morning."

"Oh?  Is it only a morning thing?"  Dorian asked playfully.

I shrugged.  "I don't think you'll catch me dancing around any other time without me purposefully doing so."

"True."  Dorian whiped his hand on the rag on the counter then said, "What else can I help you with?"

"You can go pick out a wine from your place."  I interjected.  I hoped he didn't think I was saying he was a lush, I just know he liked wine with his food.  Probably would have it with breakfast if he could get away with a glass or two.

Dorian nodded.  "Alright.  I think I can manage that.  I will have to show you a few good pairings for your normal routine I think."  He winked at me and headed out the door to walk to his apartment around the corner.

I started the finishing touches when my phone rang.  I didn't think to look at the caller id as I told my phone to answer it.  "Hello?"

A gruff voice responded.  "Nox.  I need you to bring a bottle of red wine when you come tonight."

I froze and swallowed hard.  Garrett had my number.  And despite my best effforts not to let the man's voice upset me I could feel the bile rising up as I quaked in fear.  The threat against my self and my family paralyzed me.  I took a deep breath and tryied to steel my nerves.  "Of course, Garrett.   I will see you then."  And then I tapped the end call button with my knuckle and set the knife down before I hurt myself.

I was working through an anxiety reducing exercise when Dorian opened the door and found me breathing deeply as I was wound down on the one thing I could taste.  For once it wasn't the hardest thing to figure out as I was fixing food.  But that wasn't where my mind went as I smelled the soft scent of calm waft towards me.

I turned to see Dorian walking my way with a concerned look on his face.  I grinned at him and waved away the concern and reached for the bottle of wine in his hand and stepped into his body. I didn't have to bend or lean to reach his lips as I kissed him.  I focused on the soft caress of his lips against mine.  It helped stablize me.  

I pulled away from him and looked at the bottle he'd brought as he asked me, "What was that for?"  Dorian took the bottle of wine from me and poured two glasses in the wine glasses he'd pulled out of the cabinents before he left.  Dorian handed me a glass and I finished plating the steak salad I'd made for us.

I smiled at him.  "I wanted to taste you."  I handed Dorian a bowl and he leaned against the counter and dropped his fork in to the leafy green bowl and started eating.  I followed his lead and leaned against my own ledge of a counter.  

Dorian grinned at me, "I'm going get spoiled if you keep cooking for me."

I laughed.  "I don't mind."

He took a step towards me and put his bowl on the counter and looked across the small distance between us.  "What exercise reduces anxiety and makes you want to kiss me?"

I couldn't help the smile that splayed across my face.  "5 things I can see.  4 things I can touch, 3 things I can hear, 2 things I can smell and 1 thing I can taste."  I paused a moment as he understood the exercise.  "Just a little mind claming techneque and breathing exercise rolled into one.  Control of my surroundings.  You walked in as I was doing the last one.  And you were tempting so I kissed you."

He smiled at me and reached for his bowl again.  "Why did you have to do the exercise?  Me leaving upset you?"  I looked over at him and saw the sparkle of humor in his eyes and I couldn't help but smile.

"Garrett just called."

The look on Dorian's face said it all.  He was angry but I wasn't exactly sure what he was angry over.  We hadn't really discussed the whole situation.  "You going to be okay tonight?"

I shrugged and gave him a nervous laugh.  "I guess.  I mean I don't have a choice in the matter really.  If I go I have to endure my fears.  If I don't go he could hurt you, or Aidan or Drake or even Stella and I couldn't live with myself if he did that."

Dorian frowned.  "I don't think he'd hurt them.  I know after your accident I looked into what I suspected.  I watched recordings but I never saw anything out of the ordinary."

I interrupted.  "You wouldn't have seen anything.  Patterns can't be caught on camera except for a veil.  All you see is me standing against the wall.  I learned to keep quiet, and hold still or it would be worse."

Dorian sighed.  "He never had others up against the wall like you.  Most kids were happy to be with Garrett."  

I started to feel the anger rise inside.  He didn't beleive me.  Dorian moved before I could say anything or do anything.  He had me by one hand and was lifing my chin to look up at him all before I could let my anger rise.  He continued softly.  "Nox.  I beleive you.  I know he hurt you.  But I can't find evidence.  I couldn't then and I can't now.  I've tried.  And without something to call him on the Imperodro won't issue anything."

Dorian sounded defeated.  He looked at me and pulled me close as he could with my food still in my hands.  I wrapped my arms around his waist and Dorian held me close.  He whispered in my ear.  "I know this is killing you."

I almost let myself collapse into Dorian and rid myself of the fear even for  a moment.  But I stood straight, my ego getting the better of me.  I couldn't take comfort in Dorian.  I could stand strong on my own two feet.  

Dorian continued in a soft comforting voice, "We will protect what is ours, Nox. He even comes near Aidan in anything but a loving manner and I will kill him myself."  Dorian pulled away from me.  "I'm sorry I could do nothing for you then.  We will find away through this Nox.  I am here for you.  He won't hurt anyone we love."

He loved me?  I was overwhelmed with feelings that were foreign to me.  I knew how I felt about Dorian, but I had never been sure how he felt about me.  Now I think I might have an idea.  I pulled Dorian close to me and kissed him softly. I felt his body against mine and in that moment I wanted more than just a kiss.  My hands strayed across his body and I could feel the soft cotton of his shirt under my hands, I wanted to feel the tender skin beneath my fingers.

Dorian's hands were nervously on my arms, he wasn't trying to move them or pry them from his body but he was uncomfortable and I stopped and pulled away from him with a sad smile.  "Too much?"

Dorian looked up at me with sparkling blue eyes.  I felt the heat of the moment in that gaze.  He shook his head.  His words came out in a bare whisper, "No.  Just..."

I took a step back and put my bowl of salad between us.  "It's okay." I said softly.  "That wasn't slow.  We don't need to do that yet."  He grinned at him.  "I'm sorry."

Dorian looked sad.  "Don't apologize."  He took a sip of his wine and several more bites before he looked up at me again with a smile.  "It's not that I don't want to Nox.  It's just I have to go back to work and..."

I laughed.  "Really?  That's what you are worried about?  Someone knowing we'd done something?"  It wasn't funny as in haha, but it made me laugh at myself for thinking I was the problem.  It was the image.  I grinned at Dorian.  "So if I had done that say tonight, you'd have been more comfortable."

Dorian thought about it and shrugged as he chewed on the last peice of steak in his bowl.  "I don't know."  He winked at me.  "We'll have to give it a test run I'd think."

I laughed.  "Well, sadly tonight I don't think I'll be in a place to try again.  Dinner with Garrett and Stella is going to be difficult."

Dorian nodded.  "It doesn't have to be tonight.  But since I'm not invited, stop by afterwards - that is if you want to."

I nodded.  "You don't mind Drake stopping by with me do you?"

Dorian shook his head.  "Of course not.  You both are welcome to stay as long as you need to Nox.  Anytime."

I smiled at the man who I was fastly falling for.  "Thanks."  Was all I could say but it didn't cover near anything that I felt.  But I didn't want to make Dorian concerned or scare him away.  I knew I was not myself.  I didn't fall in love.  I never let anyone in but in this one moment in my life I was falling head over heels and all because Dorian made me feel safe.  

I pushed away the thoughts of rejections lingering.  Why would he stay with me?  I had nothing to offer him but baggage and lame excuses for my behavior.  But I pushed it all away and started cleaning up.  Dorian stood beside me and rinsed and dried the dishes I washed.  I couldn't help the smile on my face.  He was either enabling me or I was falling into his neat-freak persona.  Probably a bit of both. 

We finished the dishes in silence.  I was almost uncomfortable in the silence, but with Dorian standing next to me I was calm and at peace in it.  Oddly enough.

Dorian dryed his hands on the dish towel and leaned against the sink looking at me as I put things away in their proper places.  He grabbed my arm and pulled me to him.  "You going to be okay tonight?"

I grinned at him.  "I will keep that kiss in mind and I will be."

"What kiss?"  Dorian asked.

I leaned in and kissed Dorian.  I could taste the lingering flavors of lunch and the wine on his lips.  He pulled me closer and I pulled away with a grin, and whispered.  "That kiss."

Dorian laughed.  "I will see you and Drake tonight?"

I nodded, "And you'll see me in a few hours."  Dorian nodded with a smile as I continued, "Think you can keep your hands off me?"

I watched as the humor washed over Dorian and he shook his head in disbleif.  I grinned madly at him.  "No?  However will we get through our first meeting then."

Dorian laughed softly and pulled me in to kiss but he pushed me away.  "See it wasn't that hard."

I chuckled as I walked towards the door.  "I will be up at 2 as per scheduled and we can see through that first test."

Dorian nodded.  "So easily distracted."

I smiled.  "See you Dorian."  I kissed him on the cheek as he walked out the door.  I watched him until he turned the corner to the elevator.  I did enjoy watching the way he moved - the grace of a cat but built like a wolf.  My body reacted to my thoughts and I had to turn to work or I'd be forever lost in a daze induced by my attraction to Dorian Vega.
