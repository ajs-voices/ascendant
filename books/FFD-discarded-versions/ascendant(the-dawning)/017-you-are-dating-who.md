# You Are Dating Who?

Dorian washed the dishes.  He insisted and refused to move from in front of the sink when I tried to persuade him to leave them.  I let him and started the movie for the boys.  It was a Disney flick - Cars 2 I hadn't seen the first one.  I complained to them playfully.  "I've not see the first one."

Dorian spoke over the running water.  "It's cute.  Aidan has watched it everytime he was at the house.  I needed to change it up a little.  Stella also bought both versions of planes to keep at my place."

I laughed.  "Aidan likes his cars and trucks.  I will have to remember that."

Both of the boys curled up under Drake's blanekt and watched the movie.  Dorian sat down at the bar when he had finished washing the dishes.  The long sleeves of his pale blue button down shirt were rolled up and I could see the tattoo that started at his wrist and went up to his shoulder.  I knew it covered half of his body and my mind wandered to places I would love to see how it looked.  

He cocked his head to the side and asked, "A penny for your thoughts?"

I felt the blood rush to my ears and I moved to sit down next to Dorian.  "I don't think you really want to know."

Dorian turned towards the kitchen his back facing the TV.  He was attempting to hide the conversation from the boys.  "Truth Nox.  Enlighten me to your thoughts."

I sighed and got up from the bar stool and grabbed another beer and the bottle of wine.  I poured Dorian another glass in a real wine glass instead of the plastic we'd used when picnicing with the boys.  "It requires alcholol?"

"Not for me." I opened the beer bottle and sat back down, tossing the lid into the sink to deal with later.  "I was imaging your tattoo, parts I've not seen."

Dorian turned a soft shade of red but it quickly vanished.  He had known part of it at least the reason I hadn't wanted to say anything.  I could tell from the way he froze just a little.

I tipped my beer and faced the TV to watch the boys.  "Don't worry about it Dorian.  I'll behave."

He leaned over and whispered.  "I wasn't worried about it either way."

I wasn't exactly sure what he meant by that.  I wanted to ask him but I let it be.  He hadn't expressed displeasure in my thoughts.  Maybe there was still hope?  

I watched the rest of the spy car movie from the bar.  The boys had quickly turned from the movie to driving cars around my living room.  I'm not exactly sure where they got them from.  They had to be in either Aidan or Drake's bag.  We'd have to have something more.  But they were having fun.

Dorian and I chatted about other things.  Adult things as we watched the boys driving their little Chevys and Fords across the furniture in fits of giggles.  We didn't really get much adult talking done.  Nothing about patterns, every time we started we had to stop because the boys were too rambunctions or they interrupted, so we gave up.

All in all I enjoyed the time.  There was a knock on the door.  I looked to Dorian, "Stella picking Aidan up here?"

He nodded.  "Yeah.  She's stopping by to get him before going home."

"Alright."  I got up and answered the door.  The short little red head I'd met on the plane stood in front of a man who was looking the other way as one of our neighbors past.  "Hey Stella.  Fancy meeting you here."

She smiled up at me.  "Dorian still here with Aidan?"

"Yep, they are both here.  Come on in.  Who's your friend?"  I asked.  The man turned around and my heart froze.  I took several steps backwards without thinking about it.  Stella took it as an invitation to come in since I hadn't moved yet.  I stepped backwards and stepped on something behind me.  A little umph of a kid falling to the floor brought me back to my senses.  I'd knocked Drake over.  He didn't whine or wail he stood up and wrapped his arms around my leg.  He felt my fear.  That wasn't good.

Dorian stepped between us his eyes on Garrett.  He looked to Stella.  "This is who you are dating?"

She nodded but wasn't exactly sure what was going on.  Garrett held out his hand.  "Dorian Vega.  It's been a while."  He turned his cheerful gaze on me, "Nox."

Stella smiled, "Oh so you all know each other?"

Dorian's body language spoke of the incredible strength it took to keep his hands at his sides.  I watched the termors in his arm muscles.  "Something like that Stella."

"The rumors of my exile are false.  Kai's powers don't quite extend so far as he thinks."  I shuddered to think what Kai would do if he knew the man still walked the halls of the Apex building.  I remained frozen in place.  Unable to walk, move or comfort Drake who was picking up on my anxiety.  This was not good.

"Why would you be exiled, Garrett?"  Stella asked innocently.

His smile looked sweet, he looked like he really liked her, but I saw the venom dripping from the sickly sweet smile.  "It's just a misunderstanding.  Nothing to fret over.  It's been cleared up.  No hard feelings."

Dorian gave a curt laugh.  I jumped slightly.  Garret smiled a toothy grin at me and I couldn't move.  "So jumpy my friend."  Garrett turned to Aidan and knelt down to the little boy. "You ready to go buddy?"  He wrapped his large hand in Aidan's and my heart skipped a beat.  I couldn't move.  I wanted to pull Aidan from his grasp but I couldn't.  I couldn't protect him.  Fear continued to lance through my body.  Drake's little arms wrapped tighter around my legs it was almost painful.

Garrett looked to Stella.  "Let's go babe.  I'm sure Dorian wants to get home to leave the new father to get to know his son."  He knew.  He knew about Drake.  Every fear I had for myself I now felt for Drake.  

I watched as Garrett wrapped an arm around Stella and carried Aidan out of my apartment closing the door and talking to each other as they left.
