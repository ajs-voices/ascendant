Hours passed since Dr. Wilton left my small tiny room with no windows.  I was getting antsy again when a woman in scrubs walked into my room sporting a purple streak in her hair.  I grinned at her, Madison Hatch used to have all purple hair.  I'd seen her glancing in my room as she'd past me several times since I'd woken up a few days ago.  

She started checking the machines over then turned to me.  "I'm Nurse Hatch."

I interrupted her before she could finish her sentence.  "I know who you are.  I can hardly forget Maddy with the purple hair and the dark eye liner."

She blushed.  She remembered me too.  "Sorry, I didn't know if you'd recognize me."

I smiled and picked the purple streak of hair out of her dark locks.  "How could I ever forget this."

"Well you were a little preoccupied."

I laughed.  "You held my attention perfectly."

I caught a slight coloring of her cheeks as she put her hand on my wrist and started checking my pulse.  "I'm still surprised you remember me."

"Are you normally this self-conscious?  I don't remember 15 year old you being nearly so shy."  She'd come on to me after all.  What was an 13 year old boy to do when an older woman offers you sex for the first time.  My comment illicted a deep reddening.  I grinned playfully at her but she was studiously staring at her watch.  "You were my first you know."

Her jaw dropped and she turned her purple eyes up to me.  How had I missed the colored contacts before?  The streak of purple in her hair made the color pop.  The color of her cheeks only made things even better.  I chuckled softly, "You seem so surprised to know that."

"I guess I never really thought about it.  You'd always displayed your ...."  Madison looked down at her watch again and started counting my pulse again.

I laughed as she struggled for the word, "I get what you are saying you don't have to find a word that isn't embarassing."  I lifted her chin with my finger, "I could never forget my first, Madison."  I received a deepening blush as she continued to count the beats of my pulse.  She was far easier to fluster than I remembered - she was always so unemotional as a girl.  I wondered what had changed.

"Stop interrupting me, Nox."  She batted at me playfully.  "I need to do this."

I grinned and clamped my mouth shut and pretended to throw away the key.  She laughed then said, "Thank you."

I let her finish doing her job taking my vitals for what I hoped to be the last time in this small dingy room.  I hoped the psych ward was better equipped with windows than this room was.

When she finished jotting down her notes I smiled brightly at her.  She rolled her eyes at me, "Your dad brought you a change of clothes while you napped eariler and left a few things for you.  You can change and I'll take you over the room you'll be staying in for the next week or so."

"Or so?  Do you know something I don't?"  I was truly hoping to get out after said week was up, but now my hopes looked far fetched.

She shook her head and I watched the purple streak shake across her face.  "No.  Just I've never seen anyone go in for **only** a week."

"Ah."  I smiled, "I'll be the first then."

She laughed, "We'll see.  Get dressed and I'll show you to your room."

Madison left and I crawled out of the hospital bed and found a plastic bag with a change of clothes.  I would need more than this, but maybe they'd let Jace or my father bring me more.  I pulled on the faded black jeans and the plain DKNY t-shirt that were in the bag.  The bag was empty and I was feeling a little underdressed without my hoodie.  My skin started to crawl and my anxiety started to rise.  I had to close my eyes and take slow deep breathes to calm my heart rate before the nurses rushed in.

But I'd already set off the sensors and Madison walked in slightly shaken.  "You alright?"

I nodded with my eyes still closed.  "Fighting an anxiety attack.  Nothing I'm not used to."

"Anything I can do to help?"

I shook my head, "Not unless you've got a hoodie stashed somewhere."

I opened my eyes to see Madison cocking her head to the side and a purple fingernail tapping her lip.  "Does it have to be a hoodie?  I can get you a doctor's coat temporarily."

I shook my head and sighed.  "I don't know.  The long sleeves would make me feel better.  But it's not the same."

She laughed softly, "Will you be okay here without one while I call your Dad to bring you one?"

I took a deep breath and nodded.  "Don't worry about it.  I'll be fine.  Survived in the paper night gown, I think my own clothes will do until I get more of my own things around me.  I assume I can have more of my own things?"

Madison nodded, "After inspection, yes.  So you want to wait?"

I nodded.  "I'll be fine.  I conquer my fears daily."

She smiled sadly then her eyes light up like nothing sad had crossed her mind.  What I wouldn't give to have known what made her sad.  Or happy for that matter.  She nodded, "Come with me then, Mr. SÃ©tanta and I'll take you to your new room."

"Nox."

"What?"  She asked.

"Just Nox."

She laughed.  "You have quite a few hang ups don't you?"

I nodded as I followed her.  "Yes ma'am I do."
