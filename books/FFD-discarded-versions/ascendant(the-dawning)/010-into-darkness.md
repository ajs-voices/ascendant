# Into Darkness
_Thrusday, July 16, 2015 4:25 PM_

No one stopped me.  No one said anything as I walked to my little fishbowl room and flopped down on my bed.  The door swung wide and stayed put and I could feel a cool draft from the hall into my room.  

I sank into the darkness of my own thoughts.  My life meant nothing to the Venatori.  The people who were to take care of me threw me away on a regular basis all starting with my mother and now with Dr. Eriksen.  I hated the Venatori for their arragoance but yet I knew nothing else.  I am nothing else.

I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing.  The hatred and anger could be all consuming.  I felt it well up inside and subside with each passing breath.  I felt the tides of sleep pulling me in.

The darkness wrapped itself around me.  A chaos of patterns bloomed in my vision.  Reds and greens shifted in swirls of Christmas vomit as the yellows and blue made horrid shades of green as they mixed and mingled.  Patterns became abstract like I was living in a world made by Picaso.  Fires started in every creavice of my mind.  Little children danced in bonnets and bayonets.  One flaying the other before there was nothing but puddles of blood sifting through the kalidescope of colors.

And then it was black again.  The shifting colors were there covered in darkness.  Things would bump against my extremedies.  The cool breeze blew against my skin and it felt plesant until it became ice cold and my skin froze in ribbons. 

The fires from before burned through the darkness until I saw nothing but the flickering flames and I felt their red hot heat through my dreams.  I could feel the sweat beading on my brow.  I wipes my hands across my forehead and they came back blood red.  I was too distracted by the red on my hands to notice the red eyes coming near and when I looked up I saw my nightmare face to face.  His eyes were no longer red and glowing but the amber brown I remember them to be.  He smiled down at me like days of old.  I tried to get away.  

I started awake as my shoulder fell against the concrete floor of my room.  My heart was racing.  And my shoulder ached from the short fall to the floor but I didn't bother getting up.

There was a knock of the open door and I craned my neck to see who it was.  If it were either of the esteemed doctors who were keeping me here I would have thrown them out of my room with a gust, but in the dim light of the hall way stood the small image of the little wolf.  She whispered, "Can I come in?"

I laid my head back on the concrete, "Nothing stopping you.  Just close the door behind you please."

Jo sat down on the floor beside me and leaned against the head of my bed.  I grinned up at her, "There is a chair."

She smiled, "But you are down here."

I smiled.  "So curtious of you."

She put her hand against my cheek and I found myself nuzzling against it longing to smell the soft scent of forest on her skin.  Why was she pulling me towards her.  I knew part of the answer was the sterility of the room.  It reeked of nothing, even after Dorian had spent hours here with me.  "What's up Jo?"

She shook her head, "You looked like you could use a friend."

"Did I now?"

She nodded, "You slammed doors and when I came down earlier you were sleeping.  Not so peacefully.  I was walking by again to check on you when you fell out of bed."

I laughed.  "I've not done that in years."

"The nightmares?"  Jo asked softly.

"The nightmares were new, but they are always there.  I meant falling out of bed."

She giggled softly.  It was soft and sweet and she cut it off the second she noticed she was doing it.  I guessed she liked that tough girl attitude as much as I enjoyed my mask.  "I used to fall out of bed as a kid because of the nightmares.  The first time it happened I was on the top bunk.  Thankfully Jace switched with me the next night and I didn't have quite so far to fall from then on out."

Jo smiled, "Jace?  Your best friend right?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  Sweet southern kid who's parents forced him to take me home with him that first Christmas break.  They took pity on me and his family made me feel like part of theirs whenever I went home with Jace.  We didn't start out as friends, he was like the other boys till that vacation when we got to spend some quality time being boys.  We had a lot in common and a lot not in common.  We've been friends ever since."

"I've never been in a place long enough to have friends."  

I reached up behind me and took Jo's hand.  "I'm sorry."  I sat up and leaned against my bed and held Jo's hand.  "You've got here now."

Jo shrugged.  "Here's just here until they throw me out too."

I laughed softly.  "You aren't going to get thrown out unless you are better.  And I'm guessing things get pretty bad for you once a month.  Anger issues?  Control seems far away."

She nodded.  "What are you a psych major?"

"No.  I've studied most supernatural creatures and their cultures.  Enough to understand them so I can hunt them down so I can kill them."  I frowned, "Or so that's what I've been told."

"Supernatural creatures?  Like Dragons and Orges and stuff?" I could hear the disbeleif in her voice.

"Yeah exactly that.  You are a werewolf.  I'm going to guess what happened.  You lost your parents young - a wolf attack I'm going to guess.  You were bitten probably in the hospital for a time until you healed up proper.  Except you weren't always in control.  Now with no parents, anger and control issues you bounced from foster home to foster home until your case hit Venatori ears and you wound up here with little else to do with a potential werewolf they stick you in here."

Jo sighed, "That's almost exactly right.  Except I don't think it was ears I fell upon.  I think I caused a scene, tore through a store in an uncontrolled rage.  That's what they tell me anyway."

"But they didn't kill you?"  I was surprised by that.

She shrugged.  "I'm here.  I guess not."

I smiled and pushed my shoulder against hers, "I'm glad."

Jo smiled and leaned against me, "Me too.  Do you want to talk about your dreams?"

I leaned my headback against the bed and stared up at the ceiling.  "Not really.  But I'll tell you if you want to know."

"Does it help to talk about them?" 

I wondered why she was asking that particular question.  "It can.  But honestly I can't explain half the dreams I've been having lately.  Everything's changed.  It's like almost dying has made things worse."  I sighed.  "My nightmares are all the same - or they were."  I turned and faced Jo and pulled my journal from underneath my pillow and showed her the pages.  "Always the same figure.  Always red glowing eyes - always tentacles of air and earth striking my flesh.  Always the same.  They've been consistant for most of my life.  All stemming from the same place, the same fear."

She glanced up from the sketches with her brown eyes and I saw sadness, "What fear"

"Fear of him."  It was that simple.  I was terrified of Garrett.  To this day he scared me.  

"Who is he?  Do you know him?"  

I didn't know what to say to that.  I'd told three people in my life about that particular incident.  Did I want to share with a complete stranger?  Jo saw my hesitation and smiled, "You don't have to tell me."

I gave her a weak grin.  "I've only just recently confided in anyone about it.  It's my darkest secret.  My deepest fears and Margo is just now learning of it.  She said it explained a lot."  I sighed.  "My unwillingness to discuss it even with her in the confines of my comfort zone spoke to how greately I feared him.  How much I fear him now."

"You still fear him?"  She put her hand on my knee and I glanced down at it.  

"Yes." It came out a hushed whisper.

"Did he hurt you?"

I could feel the phantom pains in my back start to ebb and flow through my body as I thought about what he'd done.  What he does to me in my dreams on a nightly basis.  I closed my eyes and scooted around so my back was to Jo.  I lifted the back of my shirt revealing the scars that flayed my back.  The layers upon layers of skin healed and rehealed over repeated beatings was the only explanation for it. Jo touched the scars on my back and I started to panic at her soft caress.  I pulled a familiar pattern around me and Jo gasped from behind me.  "What did you do?"

I let the shirt fall back down around my waist and turned back towards her.  I could feel my heart starting to race.  "Just hid it.  It's easy to do.  It's a personal veil.  One he taught me early on so he could continue without anyone knowing.  It was for my own good - he said."  I looked down at the gray pitted floor of my room.  "And it was.  I learned to control my abilities.  My emotions will never get the better of me and I will not hurt anyone without my express knowledge of it."

"How old were you?"

"I was five when I came here.  My mother brought me and left me with Dorian.  She never looked back.  I didn't see her again until I was 18.  And it wasn't a happy reunion.  But because I was a firestarter they put me in a special room and special classes.  He was my teacher there.  The first day he tried to make me spark.  Our time grew short and he was running out of options.  I could tell it was upsetting him.  He hit me with the back of his hand.  I sparked.  The garbage can caught fire.  I hadn't meant it and he comforted me and told me it would be alright."

I tried not to close my eyes, I didn't want to see the images playing out in my head.  "The next day he made me afraid.  He told me to remove my shirt, I didn't listen.  He didn't like it and hit me.  When I complied he weilded air and earth one after the other until I'd spark.  He'd hit me more if I sparked.  It was the fear and the pain and the lesson he was teaching."

I sighed, "I learned to comply to his every whim.  I gave in to his power.  I feared the lashes, but I feared he'd do worse.  He told me not to tell anyone or it would be worse.  Days went on and he grew to like the power over me.  I started dreaming about the days with him.  My fear growning each night and into the day my dreams would be relived."  I took a deep breath.  "On my last day with him, he beat me as a final test.  I failed it on purpose.  I let fire lose at his feet and I watched him dance in the flames.  The sound of the fire alarms brought me back from the edge and I doused the flames and begged forgivness.  I spent 3 months in a detention center under pshcye eval.  Very smiliar to this, except the room is smaller and there was not social interaction except with Margo.  I only just told her what happened."

When I looked at Jo she was watching with me with a blank look.  I looked away.  I hated to see pity on someone's face.  She put her finger under my chin and made me look at her. "That's horrible."

I grinned.  "Such is my life."  I stood up and stretched.  My body ached.  "I don't want to talk about it anymore.  Did I miss dinner?"

Jo shook her head.  "No. It should be close to time."

I smiled.  "Please don't tell anyone."  

Jo stood up and put her hand in mine and grabbed my key card from my pocket.  I couldn't help but grin as she was being overly familiar.  And for some reason I didn't say anything to make it awkward.  I wondered why I'd do that but I smiled at her as she pulled the door open.  "I won't tell a soul," she said with a smile and we left my room hand in hand and I felt an odd comfort in it.
