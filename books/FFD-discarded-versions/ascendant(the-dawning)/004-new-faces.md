# New Faces
_Wednesday, July 15, 2015 12:30 PM_

Lunch at 12:30 wasn't exactly part of my schedule but I didn't work on my schedule anymore at least not for the next week.  I fought back the emerging anxiety and followed the small crowd through yet another set of double doors.  The cafeteria as more like a resteraunt, except with assigned seats.  

I saw Madison walk my way and stopped at a table and pointed at my spot.  Everyone moved to their seats like children in school.  I knew there were reasons for it.  It stopped fights and put those who's OCD was worse than mine at ease.  So I walked over and Madison smiled before she left to go back to her thing.  I was grateful for her assitance I despised looking like a fool in a crowd.

I sat down at the table of six, two of which had already taken their seats.  I took the time to observe each one not for appearance sake but their patterns.  It was a habit I'd made when meeting new Venatori - or other supernatural creatures.  I could tell alot about a person from their patterns.  Humans didn't really possess a pattern, so when I saw a girl probably two or three years younger than me sitting across from me I was shocked to see nothing around her.  

She gave me a frown and I smiled back at her.  "What's your problem?" she spouted off angrily.

My smile turned to a playful grin.  "I don't have one.  Just surprised you are human."

She looked at me like I was an alien and whispered, "How did you know that?  Everyone assumes I'm one of them."

I held out my had.  "I'm not one of them either.  Nox."

She didn't take my hand and I couldn't help but laugh as I pulled my hand back.  She gave me a weak smile before she introduced herself.  "I'm Lori.  Sorry about that."

I shook my head.  "No worries.  I understand."

"Do you? Really?" she asked with surprise lighting her voice on fire.  It was almost meant as sarcasm but I think she was trying to bite at my comment instead.

"We all have a reason to be here.  I'm not going to judge your triggers and honestly don't care if it's you being a germaphobe or if it's the fact that I'm a guy.  Doesn't matter.  I understand."  

The man sitting next to her laughed.  "She's not afraid of men. Or germs.  Though both are pretty much the same."  He offered me his hand.  "Cliff.  And this here is my friend Amelia."  He nodded to the empty chair to his left and I raised an eyebrow.  Okay - imaginary friends were not exactly something I expected. 

I took his hand and nodded to both of them.  "Nox.  A pleasure I'm sure." I feigned kissing the female imaginary friend's hand like I would any other woman and Lori laughed.  It was sweet and melodic like a tiny fairy and truly could get on my nerves.

A gruff looking man sat down to my left.  "Another playboy."  I winked at him and he scowled.  He was big.  Not just tall but broad too.  I probably didn't want to mess with him.  I valued my life above all else.

Clif shook his head, "Don't mind him.  He's always like that.  He means well.  He goes by Duke.  But that's not his real name."  I raised an eyebrow and Cliff continued in a hushed whisper.  "It's Julian."
 
I saw the fist fly and I immediately reacted without thinking about it.  I threw up a wall of air between the fist and it's intended target, which by hapenstance was not me for a change.  Julian... no Duke's hand bounded off my wall of air and he stared at it with a look of confusion on his face.

I stood up and smiled polietly at my new towering friend, he even had a good two or three inches on me.  "Sorry Duke.  Old habits die hard.  I reacted without thinking."

He grumbled then clenched his fist as if he were going to throw another punch, at me this time.  But he sat down and shook his fist out.  "You did taht?"

"Yeah, sorry.  Habit."  I conveyed with sympathy I knew hitting the wall of air hurt like a son-of-a-bitch.

"Pansy boy like you got in fights often?"  He was patronizing me and I laughed.

"Yeah Pansy boy like me won nearly every fight too."  I grinned sheepishly at him.

He laughed, "With that trick I can see why."

The bell rang and a small girl quickly sat down at our table.  She looked at me with disintrest and I couldn't help but smile.  She reminded me of a spit fire I once knew.  She was good in bed but a horrible kisser.  I didn't think this girl would care for my train of thought if she cared about anything at all.  She looked pretty out of it.  I was surprised to hear a southern accent when she spoke, "Philip and Bob still outta it?"

Duke nodded, "Yeah, the fight they had was pretty bad."

I had apparently missed a fight, and i wondered if those two men I'd seen earlier were my table mates.  Interesting if they were.  

Duke nodded in my direction, "New kid is Nox.  This is Jo.  Stay on her good side if you know what's good for her."

I grinned playfully, "She has a good side?"

The spit fire choked out a laugh and spewed water all over her empty table sitting.  "He's funny."  She didn't sound like she was amused.

"I try."  I gave her a playful wink and she rolled her eyes at me.

Several carts of trays came out from a back room and wheeled around to each table dropping of covered plates of food.  Everyone at the table sat with the covers on and I stayed my hand at removing it.  I hated ceremony - pomp and circumstance for my meals was truly going to suck.  

Everyone in the room got a plate, the carts were all wheeled back out and a bell chimed and everyon pulled the cover off their plates.  I was a second or two slower than everyone else but I was soon amazed by the food sitting on my plate.  I glanced at everyone elses and saw that each was different.  I had to ask, "Do you make orders?"

Jo snickered behind her fork.  Lori nodded.  "Every week."

Duke looked at my plate and scoffed.  "You a vegetarian?  Never seen so many vegetables on a plate before."

I asked mostly because I really had no idea what the day was.  "What's today - like what day of the week?"

Jo laughed, "You really don't know?"

"A coma and a lightless room tend to play tricks on you."  I smiled as I took a forkful of the chicken on my plate.

Jo shrugged, "It's Wednesday."

I nodded, "Margo must have put my order in."

Cliff spoke quietly, "Amelia asks why you'd think that?  I think she has a crush on you."

I grinned at the empty seat beside Cliff, "She's mighty fine herself, Cliff.  Margo would know what I eat on a given day."

"Your girlfriend?"  Cliff asked almost jealous and it made me wonder if the older man was the one with the crush.  

I grinned at him, "My therapist.  One of my coping mechanisms - same food each day of the week.  All part of my schedule."  It always felt weird when someone asked about my eating habits, but they all just nodded and kept on eating.  Here I wasn't the weird one.

We chatted over lunch.  Lunch wasn't usually chicken but it would do, as long as I wasn't eating exactly the same thing for every meal.  I didn't learn anything about why anyone was here, but I didn't ask either - nor did I really care.  And they didn't seem to care that I was here either.

A second round of carts came through bearing small white cups and bottles of water - med time apparently.  Madison dropped a cup in front of me with two small white pills.  I looked up at her and she smiled.  "Take your medication and we'll talk in a few moments."

I wasn't going to take any pills here or anywhere.  I could manage my issues without being doped up.  Madison smiled brightly at me and whispered, "Please don't make a scene."

I sighed and swallowed the pills in one deft movement.  I frowned as the pills touched my tongue and left a horrid after taste.  I tried to drown the taste with the supplied water bottle which envoked a fit of laughter from Jo.  I was going to like Jo.

Everyone left through another set of doors.  I stood up from my chair and started to follow but Madison caught my arm.  "Let's discuss your stay."  

I grinned at her and followed her back to my room.  She opened the door with a swipe of her card and stepped inside.  She pulled a chair out from the small table I had placed my laptop on.  I stood just inside the door as it closed behind me.  

Madison nodded towards my things.  "You can finish putting things away if you want.  I see whoever packed your things found you a hoodie."

I nodded, "I'm sure Margo did."

"You call your therapist by her first name?"  

"She's been my therapist since I was six.  There's a certain amount of informality that happens after so long."

Madison's purple eyes were wide with surprise.  "Six?"  I nodded and she whistled.  "Wow.  Okay then.  Let's start then shall we."  I sat down on the bed and she laughed at me.  "The pills you took are standard placebo.  Everyone here takes something.  We make sure no one can say well he doesn't have to take anything.  We have very few residents that do not take some sort of medication.  Dr. Silverman insisted that we not try to put you on anything.  She said, and I quote.  If you put him on medication you will find him even more disagreeable than he is when he's off medication."

I laughed from my belly.  "She would know.  We tried several when I was a child.  I'm sure medication has gotten better over the years, but I've learned to cope."

Madison nodded.  "Thank you for not creating a scene."  I shrugged.  "Schedule.  Dr. Silverman said you liked a schedule and so do many of our other residents so here it is.  We have a 7am wake up call.  8am is breakfast.  Meds are delivered at the conclusion and we go into the common area for social group interactions.  Each group is assigned an activity.  We spend an hour doing that and then at 10am you are allowed free time until lunch at 12:30."  Madison handed me a card.  "This is your access card. It opens your room, the common room and the telephone locks."  After lunch meds you are given free time again until dinner.  During the afternoon you will meet with your counsoler and/or your therapist.  Dr. Silverman will meet with you at 2pm for thirty minutes everyday you are here.  Dr. Wilton will meet with you on Tuesday and Thursday at 2:30 for an hour." I rolled my eyes.

Madsion took a deep breath.  "After dinner at 5:30.  You go to your rooms for down time until lights out at 8pm."

I shook my head.  "That's early.  And you make up late."

"Sleep is a must in this facility.  Do you have any questions?"

I nodded.  "Is there access to a gym?"

Madison shook her head. "No.  Sorry.  We have group yoga exercises on your given day."

I sighed.  "Are there any rules on doing my own thing on my own time?"

"Yes.  What did you have in mind?"  She cocked her head like a little puppy.  It was endearing.

"Yoga, body weight workouts.  I can use my field routines here.  No equipment needed.  I will greatly keep me from getting anxious."

Madison nodded.  "That should be fine.  Anything else?"

"The menu.  I was told everyone chooses on a weekly basis."

Madison laughed.  "Dr. Silverman gave us your list.  They mixed up dinner and lunch for you today, but they will get it right.  She has given us a list of people who can see you as well as a list of activities that you should do for her."

I nodded.  "Yeah she left me a note.  Who's on the list?"

Madison sighed.  "Dr. Silverman told me not to tell you that.  There is no reason you need to know.  They know and will come visit."

I sighed.  I knew exactly why she wouldn't tell me or I had my thoughts anyway.

Madison stood up and smiled at me.  "Any other questions?"

I shook my head.  "When's your shift over?"

Madison laughed.  "Sarah and I are here from 6am to 6pm.  I have Monday and Thursday day off.  Malcolm or Barry will be on those days."

I grinned.  "Thanks.  I looked up at the camera and grinned.  Can't wait to meet your Sarah."

Madison laughed.  "I'm sure she can't wait to meet you either.  Nox. It's been good seeing you again.  I'll be seeing much more of you in the coming days."  She swipped her card and left me alone in what was now my room.
