# Unexpected Yet Expected
_Thrusday, July 16, 2015 8:00 AM_

I finished drawing and then finished a long yoga routine to calm down just as the 8AM breakfast call came through.  I hadn't had time for a shower, I supposed that would have to wait.  I'd have to really work on a schedule if I was going to be here too long.  

I changed my shirt.  I wore an inappropriate shirt for the place I was in.  It was maroon but it said "The voices are back EXCELLENT".  I grinned as I pulled it over my head.  Jeans, shoes and my gray hoodie later I was walking out of the door and down the hall to the cafeteria.  

I found my seat.  Jo looked like she'd just woken up.  She frowned at me and I grinned at her.  She smelled different than everyone else around.  I couldn't exactly place the reason she smelled like the soft underbelly of the forest.  I felt drawn to her, similar to how the little dragon boy had been drawn to me in the cave.  She smelled familiar.

Jo glared at me with a dark gaze, she was pretty underneath all that distrust and whatever else lined her face.  I wondered why she was here.  Lori and Chuck quickly joined us.  Chuck sat down after pulling the chair out for Ameila next to me.  I laughed, "Are you sitting next to me Ameila?  I'm flattered."  

Lori giggled and Chuck beamed.  Jo rolled her eyes as Duke flicked the top of her head and sent a tuft of bed ratted hair up into the air.  Lori's giggles only increased.  Duke sat down.  Two others joined us this morning, they were indeed the two I had seen that were displaying chaotic patterns of fire.  Today they looked like regular Magnus.  I nodded to them and I caught one of them staring past me but at me.  He knew what I was.  

He was sitting next to me, in Ameila's spot and I almost stopped him but he edged the chair as far from me as possible.  I scared him.  I kept my hands to myself.  "I'm Nox.  Can you tell me what's wrong?  I might be able to fix it."

The other new face answered.  "He sees all sorts of things.  Don't mind him.  I'm Philip and that's Bob, Nox.  It's always fun when they introduce other Magnus to the room."

I grinned at him.  "I can imagine."  I looked at Philip and smiled.  He was Fire only, about a three.  "An I3?"

He nodded, "How did you know?"

"It's a gift."  I turned to look at Bob.  "IT4.  Though he's a bit different than most I've seen."

Bob looked at me with fear in his eyes.  "You don't shift.  I see darkness around you but you don't shift."

I didn't get a chance to ask Bob what he meant by darkness as the trays were rolled out and my plate was sat in front of me.  The cover was neatly set on top of my plate and I resisted the urge to look inside.  I could guess what I was having.  My stomach rumbled and I knew it would do so again before every plate was served.  I had not eaten since lunch yesterday.

Bob didn't look too comfortable as he pulled himself towards his plate.  He was afraid of me.  "Can I ease that fear?" I asked hoping that he could explain things so I could help at least a little.

Bob whispered,"What are you?"

I didn't give him my normal response.  "I'm Cesari.  My pattern doesn't fluxuate like everyone elses.  It's constant unless I change it.  I don't know what the darkness is."

Lori giggled as she pulled the cover off her train reavealing a heaping stack of pancakes drenched in strawberry sauce.  As each one removed the covers my heart started to sink as everyone had the same thing.  I pushed the anxiety back before it had a chance to rise.  I needed food.  Lori wasn't giggling at her plate but at me she pointed at Bob.  "He sees things that aren't there.  He see's a wolf around Jo.  Duke has a serpant floating around his head."  

I stood up quickly and backed from the table.  My chair fell over and I tried to catch it but it clattered to the ground.  It must look like I was having an attack of some sort as men and women in scrubs can at me.  I laughed.  "I'm alright.  I didn't mean for that to happen.  I just got up too quickly."

I stared at Duke and I grinned.  There was a faint pattern sitting just on the edge of my view.  Duke was a dragon.  Which meant Jo was a werewolf.  "Let me guess, Lori he sees nothing about you."

Bob shook his head, "Just colors."

"Explain."

"You beleive me?"

I laughed.  "I'll believe anything improbable.  My best guess is your mental ability is that of seeing Auras.  Human's don't have images, they are colors.  The magical ability isn't strong enough to form images.  But Venatori and other supernatural ones do.  Is that why you are here?  Because no one beleives you see things?"

Bob shook his head and picked up my chair and bade me to sit again.  "No," he imparted with ease.  Whatever he thought of my aura now had lessened because I understood.  "Because they hurt too much sometimes."

I frowned, "I'm sorry."  I finally lifted the cover to my plate and smiled an nice omlet no sickly sweet pancakes.  

Duke looked at my plate and shook his head with a laugh, "What are you a health nut?"

I grinned.  "Compared to the lot of you, it seems that way."

Philip smiled, "That'll change."

I shook my head.  "Unlikely.  I've been eating the same thing on the same days for the same meals since I was 10 and was allowed to make my own food."

"Why?"  Lori asked from the childlike innocence.  It made me wonder why she was here - not here in the psych ward, but here with the Venatori.  It was rare humans lived amongst us.

I smiled.  "Being half human, I don't have Venatori strength and speed.  A healthy body leads to a strong body and I need every advantage I can get to stay on par with the rest of the hunters, not to mention all the supernatural creatures I hunt."

Duke laughed, "You are a health nut!"

"If that's what you call eating well and exercise then yeah.  I just take care of me."  It was the truth, I wasn't doing it because the masses told me to.  I was doing it for me.  It was an anxiety lessening adventure.  It helped me, so I contuned to do it, but they didn't need to know that.

We all finished breakfast, my fake pills were delivered and I took them without a word.  Lori still laughed when I made a face.  We all went into the common room and found our little groups.  It seemed that the six of us not only ate together but did everything else together.  So today we all did yoga.  I found it entertaining watching Cliff and Duke trying to do some of the poses.  Big men like that didn't look graceful at all with their ass in the air in downward dog.

Halfway through the routine Madison cleared her throat and when I looked up from childs pose she nodded in the direction of the doorway.  I looked and sighed. I knew he'd come, I didn't expect it to be so soon.  Madison knelt down beside me as I turned back into my resting position.  "Apparently Gloria and Shannon called Dr. Silverman because you stayed up all night drawing and then when you went to sleep there was this statue sitting on the table, like it appeared out of nothing.  Dr. Silverman must have sent Mr. Vega."

I choked on my laughter.  "If he heard you call him that."

Madison frowned, "It's what I've always called him."

I sat up on my heels and grinned, "Anytime I called him Mr. Vega I got an ear full.  Everytime you say that I look for my father."

Madison smiled, "Is that why you don't like to be called Mr. SÃ©tanta?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I want nothing to do with my mother."

She nodded, "Do you want to see him now, or should I send him away till visiting hours.  It's official business so he can do what he needs to now but if you don't want to."

I shook my head.  She must have seen my hesitation to suggest sending Dorian away.  "Nah, it's alright."  I looked over at Dorian and nodded.  He stepped away from the door way and I stood up grabbing my shoes and padded my way over towards where he was leading me.

I was surprised when he lead me back to my room.  Not exactly where I should be with him, but it was his choice.

I waved my card in front of the sensor and Dorian opened the door.  I waited for him to go in, I didn't want him to absently touch me.  I wasn't ready for that.  I followed Dorian in.  He was already picking up the statue and examining it.

"Only thing it's missing is the atmosphere and plants in the sphere.  I don't have seeds and it's really too small."  I pulled the notebook from beneath my journal which I'd left open and sighed as I closed the journal.

"I drew the process."  I handed him the notebook and he sat down on the edge of the table and started at the beginning.  I watched the man I'd told my feelings to study my drawings from across the room.  He showed little emotion, not that I expected him to but here I was trying my damnedest not to think about his lips or the way he stood there.  I leaned forward with my elbows on my knees as I sat on my bed and closed my eyes to keep myself in check.

Every once and a while I would hear the page flip and small sounds escape from Dorian.  He cleared his throat and I looked up, he was looking at me waiting for me to do something I guessed.  He asked, "Is this how you see all that?"

I shrugged, "Yeah.  I drew it the best I could it's not completely right."

Dorian nodded, "Never thought I'd hear modesty come from you."

I grinned at Dorian.  "A first time for everything."

He turned the page around and showed me one of the first drawings.  "What's this?"

"Nothing.  Well not really anything.  I was illustrating a zoomed in aspect of every weave I've ever seen."

Dorian frowned, "What's this then?"  He pointed to the 'sparks' in between the threads of each pattern of every element on the page.  My drawing didn't do them justice.

"I call it the essense of life.  It's everywhere.  In every pattern, but it's only alive when you look at living things.  You can't manipulate it, but you can coax it to do things."  I grinned at Dorian.  "It's the reason what I did for you works.  Why I was able to heal the vampire bite on my arm."

"Whatever possessed you to 'zoom' in on a pattern?"  Dorian's air quotes were aytpical and I couldn't help but find it amusing.

I shrugged, "I don't know.  The idea that I wanted to look deeper?  I don't know it's a pattern I wanted to understand it.  You always told me puzzles were my thing, right?"

Dorian nodded.  "Yes."  He frowned as he looked back at the notebook.  "I don't understand half of what you've drawn."

I got up and walked the short distance to Dorian and leaned against the table like he was, "Tell me and I'll explain the best I can what is what."  

I was careful not to presume too much.  I didn't sit too close, and I definately tried not to touch him.  The entire conversation was tense for me.  A constant vigil.  The lunch bell rang and I looked over at Dorian we had both been surprised by the time.  We'd been in one spot talking about the same thing for hours.

Dorian glanced down at my nightmare journal, "What's that other one for, it didn't look like this."

I sighed as I picked it up and put it under my pillow.  "Dream journal."

Dorian frowned, "That's what you dream about.  Doesn't look even mildly plesant."

I shrugged, "It's not."

I opened the door and held it for Dorian.  "I have to go to lunch.  Missing a second meal might be considered endangering myself.  And I can't have that now."

Dorian nodded, "Why did you miss a meal already?"

I grinned and nodded towards the statue.  "I was doing that."  Dorian walked to the door and I let it go as he stopped against it.  I took the statue from the desk where he'd left it.  "Here you have it.  They'll likely take it away - glass and all.  A hazard to my health."

Dorian laughed, "Don't they realize you can make far better ways to hurt yourself then replicas of statues with small glass globes?"

I grinned as I stepped out of my door and started towards the careteria.  Jo was standing in the hall watching us.  "Sure tell them my secrets.  All those mirrors and glass bottles I keep for emergency wrist slitting."  I joked and I saw Jo frown.  Suicide jokes were probably in poor taste - oh well if I was going to be here I had to make the best of it.

Dorian smiled and started walking with me towards the exit.  "What do you plan to draw next?"

I shrugged, "What would you like to see?"

"I know you cant replicate living things, but I'd like to see what you see around people, plants.  Maybe see what happens when you try to replicate a plant?"  Dorian sounded excited and my heart soared at the possiblity of pleasing him.  It was a childish fantasy - he wasn't interested but I could at least make him happy and that for some strange reason felt right in my heart.

I grinned at him as I put my arm around Jo as I walked past her, "I'll see what I can do Dorian."  I winked at him and he shook his head.  "This is Jo.  Jo, Dorian.  She's one of five I'm required to be friends with."

Dorian chuckled, "You?  Friends?  Shocking!" 

I laughed.  "Don't tell Jace, he might get jealous."

Dorian smiled.  "I won't I promise.  I'll have a live plant set to your room today."

I nodded.  "Alright.  I'll see ya round Dorian."

"Nox.  Jo."  Dorian gave us each a nod of his head as he left through the other double doors towards the exit.

Jo frowned at me, "You like him don't you?"

I smiled at her and kissed the little wolf's forehead, "You have no idea the half of it."
