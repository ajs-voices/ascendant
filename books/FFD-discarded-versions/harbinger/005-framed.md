I helped Dorian get Jo's things together, we'd have to come back later to catch everything but we made sure that she had at least enough clothes to get through a few days.  I felt strange going through her under things.  It's not like it was an unknown thing but she wasn't my girlfriend.  **I** wasn't supposed to see these things.

Dorian was watching me as I pulled and stuffed things into a bag he'd found.  I turned to see him hiding a grin behind his well manicured hand.  "What?" I asked.

He dropped his hand and I could see the grin full on now.  "You look uncomfortable.  Not something I'd expect to see of the playboy you pretend to be."

I sauntered over to the man who was teasing me.  "I don't pretend."  Which was a complete lie and I knew he knew it from the roll of his eyes.  I leaned in and whispered playfully.  "You are just jealous."

He pulled me close and I could feel the length of him against my body and I felt a lump go down my throat.  His smile widened and his eyes were full of heat.  If only we were alone.  He shook his head.  "Jealous.  I think not.  I have you right where I want you."

I grinned at him.  "I'm sure you do."  Jo rolled over in her sleep and groaned.  We both turned to look at her and saw her naked form sprawling out from the blanket Margo had placed over her.  I sighed.  "I guess I should do something about that."  

I had a better idea and something I'm sure Jo would appreciate in the morning.  I looked up into the camera in the corner of the room.  "Hey, Maddison, can you come help Jo get dressed.  Something so she's not awake naked?"

I hoped that was enough.  Dorian was still holding me close and I was enjoying his warmth even though I felt a bit too warm still.  It wasn't long before Maddison was in the room dressing Jo while Dorian and I waited outside.  We tried our best to be hands off in the public of the hallway.  The longing glances weren't doing anything for either of our moods.

Maddison opened the door and smiled at us.  "She's ready to go.  She's still not awake."

I nodded.  "I'll carry her."

Dorian grabbed her bag and I walked into the room and picked up the sleeping form of my little wolf.  It was hard to beleive I had anything to do with being a werewolf but here it was and I was just as bewildered as Jo was in this matter.

Dorian held the door for me while I carried Jo through it.  It was awkward to say the least, thankfully I could use patterns of air to help keep her steady.  I wasn't sure how far I could carry her without it.

We took the elevator.  Dorian put his hand around my waist as we rode up to the residences levels.  The air was warm and my anxiety was spiking, I didn't really know what was going on and it bothered me to no end.  My powers were going all wonky.
