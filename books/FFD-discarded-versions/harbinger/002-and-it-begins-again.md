# And It Begins Again
_Thursday, July 30, 2015 7:40 PM_

The boys were busy eating and Dorian and I had paused our prior conversation listening to the boys chatter on about school and things they were doing outside of my lessons when a knock sounded at the door.  It was probably Stella so I got up to answer it.

I opened the door with a goofy grin but it was soon washed away as I saw the man who plagued my dreams standing in front of me.  He smiled at me in a way that made me cringe in fear.  Though I did my best not to show it, but that only made his smile wider.  "Well my boy, I didn't expect to see you here."

He took a step towards me and I instinctively stepped back and he continued forward into the apartment uninvited.  I almost wished he were a vampire and the uninvited guest rule was true like it was in the fictions of the world outside of the Venatori.  When I turned around I saw Dorian standing behind his chair.  He didn't look out of sorts, he almost looked happy to see Garrett.  I would have to ask Dorian how he pretended so well.  I knew he was not happy to see my tormentor and the man who was now in close proximity to his son.

Dorian held out his hand to Garrett, "Good to see you.  We are in the middle of dinner.  Can I get you something?"

Garrett shook his head.   "No that's alright. But I can wait for Aidan to finish."  He turned to the small little red head and smiled.  "Hurry on up and eat, your Momma is waiting on you.  We have things to do."

Aidan nodded as he stuffed another orange fry into his mouth.  "Yes sir."  I gave Aidan that look and he nodded without me having to say anything.  

Garrett turned to look at me still near the door.  I hadn't moved as he'd advanced into the apartment.  I swallowed hard and took a step forward towards my own chair, but my appetite was now completely gone as I took a swallow of the water that Dorian had poured me. I might actually need a beer after Garrett left.

The man before me looked as he always had, as he always did in my dreams minus the red glowing eyes of course.  That was my mind reminding me of the evils this man had done to me in my formative years.  Garrett smiled at me.  "Nox.  Tomorrow at 5pm I have a meeting I'd like you to attend with me.  It's important that you come without the formality of the Venatori with you, which means Dorian I'm sorry you aren't invited.  If you need a wing man I'm sure the little dragon boy will be more than adequate to keep you from embarassing yourself."

I shook my head.  "No Drake will be staying with Dorian."  It was all I could say outloud, inside my head was screaming there was no fucking way I was letting Drake near Garrett or anyone Garrett was meeting with - no way!

Garrett nodded and handed me a slip of paper with an address and the date and time as a reminder.  He grinned at me.  "I'd have sent you this appointment but I'm sure you need that little bit more incentive to come."  His grin grew wider as he stared at me.  But as quickly as the grin had started it started to fade into a frown.  

I asked, "What's wrong?"  I was worried he'd take it out on me, or worse Aidan.  Or someone else I cared deeply for.  I felt like he was holding Stell and Aidan hostage with Drake as a standby.  

Garrett shook his head.  "How interesting.  You've been spending a great deal of time here haven't you?"

I nodded wondering where this was going.  Garrett started looking around.  I didn't know what he was looking for so I asked, "What are you looking for?"

Again Garrett shook his head, "Never you mind."  His eyes settled on Dorian standing behind Aidan.  I watched as the two men looked at each other.  Garrett grinned.  "How very interesting indeed."  

He looked over at Drake and watched the little dragon finish off his sandwich with a grumpy, "I'm done."

Garrett turned to me with a smile.  "We'll I've figured out one little mystery.  Now I have another to solve."  He took a step towards me and whispered in my ear.  "The more you stay here, the more horrible I will see your dreams become and that of the little dragon too."

The lump of spit I swallowed felt like a rock going down my throat.  I was going to have a panic attack but Garrett was standing right there.  He wove a small tentical of air behind my back and teased the back of my hooding sending shivers down my spine.  Garrett was threatening me.  "Don't forget the meeting Nox.  I expect you to be alone."

Dorian was at my side with Aidan's things.  "Stella is waiting for you two."

Dorian picked up Aidan and they hugged.  Dorian whispered into his son's ear and I was unable to hear what he said which meant Garrett couldn't hear either.  Aidan didn't whisper his response.  "Yes sir.  I will."  He hugged his father.  "Bye Daddy."

The little boy slithered down Dorian's body and wrapped his arms around my legs.  "Bye Nox."  I patted the little boys back and he scurried off to give Drake a hug.  The boys squeezed each other tightly, Aidan trying to lift Drake from the floor but failing.  Dorian chuckled softly as he watched.

Aidan was offering his hand to Garrett and the two left the apartment with little more to say.  But Garrett he always had to have the last word.  "Remember Nox.  5pm tomorrow."

I didn't nod or react in any way visible.  I could feel the fear lancing through my body.  What did Garrett want this time.

Dorian took the peice of paper from my hand and sat down at his laptop that was plugged in by the sofa where he'd been working before I'd come home.  He called back to me in a raised voice, "The location is just a church.  A public place, they hold a lot of community type meetings here.  It's one of the better AA places I've been told."

I grinned, "Did someone recommend you go to AA, Dorian?"

He laughed at me.  "No.  But I've had to recommend a few to ex-students who find themselves on the wrong path.  So I try to keep abreast of these things."

"Does it say what other type of meetings go on there?"

Dorian shook his head.  "No there are no listings."

I sighed.  I had no idea what I was walking in to with this one.  The only plus side was it was in public and surely Garrett wouldn't try to hurt me in public.  I hoped.

Dorian started to clean up things from dinner.  I stood still in the same spot as before trying to remember how to breathe.  I could hear Drake playing in the living room with his cars.  I whispered, "Dorian."

He came over and stood in front of me.  His sparkling blue eyes were not shining as they usually did, he was concerned.  I wondered if Garrett frightened him more than he let on.  "Garrett said the longer I stay here the worse my dreams will be when I'm not here."

Dorian grinned at me.  He leaned in and whispered in my ear, "Then don't leave."

I looked at him confused, was he really saying what I thought he was saying.  Dorian called out, "Drake how would you like to spend the night here every night?"

He looked up from the front of the couch and smiled.  "But I have my own bed at home.  Here I only get to sleep on the couch."

He was right.  That wasn't exactly going to work well much longer.  Dorian frowned.  "He has a point."

I nodded.  "Garrett was looking for something here.  He said he solved the riddle, but had a mystery to solve still.  He was looking at you before he told me that."

Dorian smiled.  "Well, maybe it's time **we** spent the night at your place instead.  See how it goes?"

I nodded.  "It should be fine.  Proximity to your fine self seems to be the key."

Dorian smiled.  "I'll pack a few things then."

I followed Dorian to his bedroom and stood in the doorway watching him put a bag on the bed and gather things he would need for an extended stay at my place.  As he packed he spoke to me.  "If Garrett can manipulate dreams, he must think he's powerful enough to manipulate them while you are awake.  A reminder of what he can do to you."

Dorian  shook his head.  "Nox how long have you had these dreams?"

I shrugged.  "As long as I can remember."

"Do you know when they started?"

"I've been keeping dream journals since I've been with Margo.  It was one of the things we worked on while I was in the detention center after I ..."  

Dorian interrupted so I wouldn't have to say what I'd done all those years ago.  "So probably been tormenting your dreams since he found out how to scare you."  Dorian packed away a few undershirts and I watched with curiousity at what things Dorian Vega thought were important things to spend the night and wake up at my place were.  "I will give him that.  He was efficient in training you however horrible it was."  Dorian looked up at me and frowned.  "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that."

I shrugged.  "It's okay.  You are right.  I wouldn't be the man I am today without Garrett's intervention.  Granted I might be as messed up without him, but I probably wouldn't have the control I do nor the fortitude to work past my issues."

Dorian walked over to me.  "You would have grown up to be a fine young man either way."

I grinned at him.  "It's okay Dorian.  My past is what makes me, there is nothing to regret only to insure never happens again."

Dorian nodded as he stepped inside his closet and pulled out traveling suit hangers and two suits.

I grinned, "You moving in?"

Dorian looked back at me confused.  "Two suits, near two of everything from what I've seen so far.  That's more than a nights stay."

Dorian blushed slightly.  "I figure it can all stay at your place even if this doesn't work.  That way I'm not worried about presentation afterwards."

I nodded.  "You are more than welcome to bring whatever you like Dorian."

He grinned at me then tossed what he had in his hands on the top of the suitcase before he wrapped his arms around my waist.  We stared at each other for endless moments before he kissed me with fevor.  I could feel his hands pulling at the back of my shirt to get to skin beneath.  We both had moments of lust for each other.  I could feel his body against mine and I could only react to the growing need between us.

A little voice spoke softly, "I'm sorry.  Nox.  I made a mess."

Dorian chuckled as he went back to work.  I left him to it while I followed Drake out to where he'd made a mess.  He kept apologizing along the way.  Thankfully Dorian's house was all tile floors and easy to clean up.  The only discredit to the slate gray floors was that when you dropped something fragile it usually busted.  Drake had tried to clean things up for us.  

I patted the little dragon's head and smiled.  "I'll clean this up.  You go pack up your things that need to go home for school tomorrow.  We are going to spend the night at home with Dorian."

Drake giggled.  "Can he be my other Daddy too?"

I grinned at him.  "You'll have to ask him that Drake."

Drake smiled.  "I'd be the only kid in class with two Daddys, except maybe Aidan."
