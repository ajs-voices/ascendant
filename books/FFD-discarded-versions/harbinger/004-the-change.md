# The Change
_Friday, July 31, 2015 12:10 AM_

Jo was huddled in a corner and the moment the door opened I could feel her power radiating at me in waves.  I could see the patterns shifting around her.  I could see the patterns shifting under her skin.  No one else seemed to notice.  I tried to think back to the time I saw LouAnn change in class.  But I didn't recall seeing this.

I heard LouAnn as the door closed behind me.  "She's going to change."  She was gasping and I knew she felt the power too.  Jo had no idea how to control it, it washed over the both of us and I was lost to it.  I had no idea how to help so I let it envelope me.

Her power flexed again and I dropped to my knees.  I took another step towards the girl who was whimpering in the corner.  I could see the contortions in her fingers, her legs and her face.  She was in so much pain she couldn't scream.  

Another wave and I fell to my hands gasping for air.  I crawled towards her as the a third wave started to pound on my body. I touched her and there was silence and a calm.  The blood rushing in my ears from moments before had vanished;  the power envelopmed me and calmed my soul.  Jo looked at me and I could see the pain in her eyes.  I pulled her against me, she moved with fluidity, I don't know what it was or how I knew but she melted into me, she lost form, shifted and changed without a scream.  

Seconds or hours had passed, I had no bearing on time when I opened my eyes and found a rather large white and black wolf lying helpless in my lap.  I was covered in the werewolf transformation fluids and gunk.  I could feel it hardening on my clothes.  I hoped it came out, I was rather fond of my limited attire.

I looked up and saw the door flash open and a small group of people rush in.  Among them was Dorian.  Drake was no where to be seen, but I trusted Dorian had him safe someplace.

Dorian knelt down in front of me while I cradled what was Jo's wolf form as she slept in my lap.  He ran his fingers over my cheek, "You've been sitting her for well over two hours motionless.  If it weren't for the ankle monitor we'd have been worried."

I smiled at him.  "Small miracles then."

He grinned at me.  "Are you okay?"

I shrugged.  "Fine.  Should I not be?"

Dorian looked down at my new look with a humorous glint in his eyes.  "You've looked better."  He ran his fingers over Jo's fur and her eyes popped open and she let out a small growl as she hopped up on to her four feet ready to pounce on Dorian.  I set  my hand on top of her rump and she turned to look at me with amber eyes.  The growl hushed and she bent lower than me.  Acknowledging my poweress over her.

I smiled.  "I guess I was her Alpha.  No idea what I did though."

Dorian shrugged.  "I don't know.  They didn't call me until they got worried about you."

I nodded. "Where is Drake?"

"Your father is with him.  I called Kai and he was more than happy to stay with him while I dealt with you."  Dorian grinned.  "He felt more comfortable being grandfather than father."

I laughed softly. "Doubtful.  He knew I'd rather have you here."

Dorian nodded his ascent, "You are probably right."

I looked at those who were still standing behind Dorian, they'd let him deal with me first.  Jo looked over me at them and growled.  "It's okay Jo."  Her growl soothed and her hair started to lay flat.  I looked up at LouAnn.  "Will I need to be here tomorrow? And the next day?"

She nodded.  "It would be best."

I frowned.  "This isn't going to work for me.  Margo, she has to be released into my care.  I can't stay here.  I can't."

Margo looked at me with concern.  But it was Dorian who answered.  "He's been having more violent nightmares as of late.  We've found he's better with me."

Margo nodded.  "We need to understand why."

"I know why.  We'll discuss it later.  Here is not the place."  She looked at Dorian and he nodded.

"I will work on getting Jo released today into your custudy but she shouldn't go home with you either."  Margo added, "Your father will kill you if he finds out."

"I'll take that risk."

"Nox.  Drake?"

"What about him?" I asked.

"You would willingly bring a werewolf into your home with your child there?"  Margo sounded like that was unfathonable concept.

"She won't hurt Drake.  I can protect my family Margo."  I stood up and the room felt warm.  My ability was taking form.  I raised my hands and a small flame rose on each one.  I could feel the power in the room shift.  The were magics converged into my little flames and I could feel small sparks of life popping in the flames.  Dorian stood staring at me.  I could feel Jo cowering at the back of my legs.  Everyone else was looking away from me as if what I was doing was too bright.

"Nox?"  Dorian asked, his voice sounded distant and flat.

"Yeah?"  I answered.

He continued to watch me cautiously.  "What are you doing?"

I shrugged.  "It has to go somewhere.  I was going to spark again."

Dorian nodded his head as he tried to understand.  I imagined he was parsing through his knowledge base.  "You can control your ability you won't spark."

I nodded.  "This isn't my power.  It feels more like nature.  But it's not mine."

Dorian nodded.  "Then how are you doing that?"

I shrugged.  "Converting it I guess.  I don't see the other one, but I feel it.  It's too hot to touch."

The power around me cooled and I let the power go.  Dorian took a step towards me.  His cool hand made me look at him.  He said, "You are burning up."

And that triggered the nurse in Maddison she was at my side with in an instant and Jo was growling her disapproval of the treatment I was receiving.  "I'm alright.  I promise." I tried to reassure her but she was looking me over, my eyes, my ears, my throat.  I was fine.  Really.  

Maddison shrugged, "He seems alright except for the excessive body temperature. But that looks to be coming down too."

"I'm alright.  I promise."  Moments later Dr. Eriksen and her team were standing outside the door to Jo's room.  We only noticed because the soft rumble from Jo grew louder as the new comers stepped into the room.

"It's alright Jo.  My monitor went off."  I looked over at Dr. Eriksen.  "I'm alright.  Not trying to kill myself.  I promise."

Her green eyes were hot and I could almost see the steam spewing from her ears.  He was angry at me.  "You willingly stepped foot into a room with a werewolf?"

Jo growled and I let her as I stood up and took a step towards the overbearing doctor.  "Who the fuck do you think you are telling me what I can and cannot do.  Jo is my friend, and **my** responsibilty.  I will take care of those who are mine in the way that I see fit.  None of this is your god-damned business.  But for the record, if I hadn't stepped in here she would likely have died or worse yet, someone else would have come in here and tried to help her and they would have died."

Dr. Eriksen scolled me.  "You think you are so damned special you are immune to the consequences of your actions."

I laughed.  "I don't think I'm special Amara, you and your fuckting team think I'm some sort of herald to a new race.  All I think is that I'm fucked up."

Jo continued to growl as I turned away from the doctor.  My anger was rolling and I could feel the new power shifting inside of me.  I touched the soft fur on top of Jo's head and she craned her neck to feel my power.  I don't know what happened next but Jo was lying naked at my feet.

I heard gasps from the room, LouAnn was down on her knees, head bowed and whispering, "I've never seen someone do that.  We've all heard of the powers.  Only Alpha's can do it, and only the strongest.  Nox you aren't even one of us."

I shrugged.  "Like I said - fucked up."

Margo put a hand on me and grabbed a blanket to cover the collapsed form of the woman at my feet.  "Nox.  Take her home.  She can't stay here.  It's not safe for anyone without you.  She's an untrained were and we all know what happens when they go rogue.  I will make the paperwork official in the morning."

I looked to Dorian and frowned.  We really were never going to have any alone time.  He smiled at me and started packing Jo's things.  Maddison hurried everyone out and stood in the doorway.  "And to think two weeks ago I was wondering if you and I could hook up again."

I turned to her with shook.  "Why in the world would you want to be with me again?"

She smiled and looked down to the slumbering woman.  "Because of this.  I saw the boy had grown."  She turned to Dorian, "You're lucky Dorian.  I'd never have thought he'd ever settle down."

Dorian looked back at me and grinned before he looked back at Maddison and the purple streak running through her hair.  "I never thought he would either.  I'm just surprised it's with me.  I think I've a lot more growing up to do."

I sighed, that sounded like issues.  Dorian looked at me with a smile.  "Not any of your concern my love.  Your heart is too big and I have to get used to it."

I walked over to him as Maddison shut the door leaving the three of us alone.  "Dorian.  I don't want to hurt you.  She doesn't have to come home with me."

Dorian laughed, "Of course she does, Nox.  She's your pack now.  You've already claimed her.  She is yours.  This only proves it.  We all study were wolves, but none of us really know what goes on in their culture.  LouAnn fell to her knees when you changed Jo back into human form.  That is a powerful gift of any Alpha.  You don't shift Nox.  You said it yourself, the power had to go somewhere."  He grinned at me.  "I'm beginning to think that your power has been shifting with the moons your entire life.  I intend to find out.  But I can almost guarantee that you had more fights near the full moons than any other time.  I could almost clock it when you'd be in my office."

I hung my head.  Dorian lifted it with a tender touch.  "Don't be ashamed my love.  You are beginning to make sense.  The more we learn about each other, the more everythings going to make sense.  I'm not asking you to change.  You took in Drake.  You will take in Jo.  These aren't lovers Nox.  They are pack and herd and kiss but most importantly they are family.  They aren't the family you were born with.  You never needed that, you have something far greater and better because of how you were raised, Nox.  You get to choose your family."

"And you don't?"

Dorian shrugged.  "Sure I do.  I choose you.  But I have familial obligations to my own family, and to Aidan.  You have ties but you never knew them.  It's just different is all."

I pulled Dorian close.  "Are you sure this is okay?"

He looked across the small distance between us and smiled.  "Perfectly okay."  He leaned in and kissed me tenderly.  "Just another interruption."

I laughed.  "Will we ever...."  I didn't finsih my sentence, there really was no need to as Dorian and I stood in the center of Jo's room living an uninterrupted moment with each other.
