# Ascendant
_Thursday, July 30, 2015 7:00 PM_

The doors to Apex Unlimited were full of summer shoppers.  Men and women scurried to and fro from the department stores inside to the parks and gardens outside.  I watched the glass plate elevator rising from the ground floor up the many stories.  A woman stood beside me looking up at me.  She smiled waiting for me to acknowledge the fact that she was there watching me.  I was inclined to just let her stare, but women had been crawling out of the woodwork these past few weeks.  I can only imagine it had to do with Asher.  

I looked down at her with her blonde hair and green eyes sparkling with a matching shade of green and ruby red lipstick.  She offered me a perfectly manicured hand in a matching shade on her finger nails.  "Sarah Bently."

I grinned at her.  "Do I need to introduce myself?"

She blushed.  "Nox SÃ©tanta."  The red faded quickly as she regained her composure.  "I've heard a lot about you."

I winked.  "All good I'm sure."

The woman blushed again and I knew exactly what she'd heard and the rumors that seemed to be percolating through the compound with women my age and then some.  I could stand in line in the cafeteria and there would be all sorts of whispers from the gaggle of teenage girls studying their text books at a near by table to the women gossiping over a cup of coffee.  Everyone seemed to forget that I was a jerk to most people.  I was like an eccentric celebreity given leeway in the attitude now.  Fuck them is all I could say.

The rumors were not much different from when I was a kid - he's a horn dog, he's willing to do it with anyone.  Just now they are more like - he's available to sire offspring, he's not going to be the real father of X's kids.  But the rumors are hardly the truth.  I have slept with a grand total of one woman in these past two weeks with the express intention of fathering a child.  I have a second offer out, but Dae'lin has yet to respond.  I expect she will now that I'm oh-so-extra special now.  Higher the prestige which seems to be growing by the moment with me.

The woman next to me took my hand I hadn't relalized I'd offered in return and shook it gently in soft fingers.  It was almost a sensual caress from the way her touch lingered and brought me back to the present and out of my own thoughts.  She smiled up at me and despite her exterior appearance I saw the tell-tale signs of a smoker.  She couldn't hide the fading yellow on her teeth as well as she could cover the smell on her hair and clothes.  That was when I noticed the over powering scent of super flowerly perfume wafting my way from Ms. Bently when the door opened behind us.

She said, "I was wondering if you'd like to get coffee sometime?"

I laughed and it made her frown.  "That's not really what you wanted to know is it?"  The sweet smile started to fade as I leaned in to whisper, "You want to know if I'll sleep with you."

As I stood straight I felt the soft skin of Ms. Bently's hand meet my cheek rather violently.  "How dare you!"

I refused to act like the slap to my face hurt, despite the fact I was sure her hand left a nice pretty red mark on my cheek.  I chuckled softly.  "You aren't the first, Duckling."  I gave her a flourishing bow and jogged towards the stairs deciding I didn't want to ride the plate glass elevator up.  I had enough of women today.  

I didn't go to my apartment, I had plans with my boyfriend.  You'd think that fact would deter women from approaching me like that, but it didn't.  I knocked on Dorian's door and waited for him to answer thinking to myself how things had changed from the prior months.  I first of all had a boyfriend - a first for me.  And for Dorian to acknowledge that I was his significant other made me think it's a big thing for both of us.  Prior to me, Dorian didn't openly socialize with men in a romantic setting - except for his best friend and ex-lover.  That still bothers me, but it's only been a few weeks since I found out.

Since then though Todd has moved out officially taking up residence in London, leaving Dorian to his own means and us alone without fear of his unannounced return.  

Dorian was taking an active role in both Aidan and Drake's life.  He routinely picked them up from school, which was something Garrett had been doing for Aidan.  It killed two birds with one stone - Garrett is no longer alone with Aidan which made both Dorian and I happy, and Dorian gets closer to his son with the added help of Drake being there to help the transition for both of them.

I hadn't seen Garrett since dinner two weeks ago and for that I was grateful.  My dreams were erratic and I was spending more and more nights in Dorian's bed than not.  But the nightmares continued when I wasn't with Dorian which is why I was leaning more and more towards the arrangement.  Dorian didn't seem to mind.  I was grateful for that.  I think he liked me cooking for him.  Though he did quip at me about gaining weight.  Which was probably not true as he was eating healthier than he was before.  

I was brought out of my thoughts with a gentle touch to my check as Dorian turned my face to see the hand print I imagined was blushing rather nicely right about now. "Who did you piss of this time?"

I grinned at him as he moved aside and let me inside.  "One, Ms. Sarah Bently.  Just told the truth.  I'm tired of the women beating around the bush when all they want is to to have my children."  The joys of being an experiment.  Asher was pushing the women at me.  And they were all the more eager to have a prominent child.  If Asher Eriksen was interested in their progeny surely it meant more for their family.  Such was the life of a Venatori.

Drake and Aidan were running around Dorian's couch and skided to a hault when I stepped into view.  They walked around and then off down the hall way where they started running again.  They knew my rules, even if Dorian didn't follow them to the letter.  He was a lot less strict without me here but he was sucking up to be the better parent.  He claimed I had an advantage I don't know what he thought it was; he would never tell me.  

I felt his arms wrap around my waist as he put his head against my back.  I turned in his embraced and Dorian kissed me softly.  We'd gone from a non-existant relationship to full blown significant others in the two weeks it had been since I was discharged from suicide watch on the pschye ward.  I still wore that damned ankle monitor and as long as I stayed away from the roof and my vitals remained normal I was good to go.

We had a few false alarms on the monitor.  The first when I'd been called up to see Asher in his office on the very top floor and a second when my vitals spiked after a particularly grueling spar with my father.

I'd had a good night's rest in Dorian's bed and I was up before my alarm sounded so I didn't wake him.  My father was up and he was working out in the little gym on our floor to an 80's playlist.  I stood and watched as my father moved from form to form faster than a human, or myself, ever could.  When he looked up through his sweat drenched hair that fell over his eyes he beckoned me to join him.  It was a taunt of sorts.

We danced through the various positions of the forms we had both been taught.  His Venatori speed and strength augmenting every move and my natural ability to fight with my own gift to bend all the elements at the same time countering one another.  But I was not as good as my father despite all my bragging about it.  He had me bloodied and heart racing which sent the alerts off quicker than either of us could calm me down.  

The sensors were thusly calebrated and my father and I had attempted to set them off again the following morning.  Needless to say we couldn't and I was more sore that second day than the first.  

Dorian took my hand and I followed him into the kitchen.  "You're doing it again."

I shook my head.  I'd drifted yet again.  "Sorry, it's been happening a lot more lately."

"Why do you think that is?"  Dorian asked.  We'd had this conversation before.

"I think it's because I'm not spilling my guts to Margo every week."

Dorian nodded, "So tell me what's on your mind.  I can be impartial.  You know this."

I grinned at Dorian.  "And how am I to talk about you when I'm talking to you?"

Dorian laughed.  "You can save that for Margo if you don't want to tell me things."

I turned to Dorian.  "I can tell you whatever.  I just don't want to burden you with my problems."

Dorian pulled me close to him.  "You aren't a burden.  I'm here to help."

"I hope you are more than here to help my mental stability." I joked.  I knew he wasn't my therapist.  But my therapist was weaning me from her to live a more fullfilling less dependant life.  

Dorian grinned.  "Yeah.  Just like you are more than my new cook."  He handed me a glass of water.  "But seriously Nox. Talk to me.  Margo said you just need to talk through it you do most of your own sessions now."

"You've been talking to her about me?"  I asked.  I knew the answer before I asked.  I knew he'd talk with Margo about me.  He had been talking to her most of my life keeping me on the straight and narrow.

"You know the answer to that.  Talk to me."

I sighed as I pulled out the ingredients for our dinner.  The boys were playing in the hall way running cars on Dorian's pristine walls. He didn't care, but he'd be scrubbing them the next time he was alone.  "I keep just thinking through things.  Worrying I guess.  This whole Ascendant thing on top of Garrett's interest in making me doing things.  And then there is this guy.  I've fallen completely in love with him.  We've been spending more time together but we've not shared more intimate pleasures."

Dorian snickered.  He knew the latter part was me picking fun at our relationship.  "And why is that Nox?"

I shrugged.  "I guess he doesn't like me that much.  Everytime we get somewhere close something happens.  The first time his ex-lover stopped by.  And the second well...."

"What did you think when his ex-lover stopped by?"  Dorian tapped his finger to his chin much like Margo would do.  He was curious but he was making a joke of it.  It was a touchy topic.

"Honestly.  I was a bit pissed off.  But the more the interactions went I noticed that my guy was keeping his ex-guy at arms length.  He was careful not to touch him.  The flirting was kept to a minimum even though I could see it was a strain.  I have never seen him like that before it was enticing and awkward all at the same time.  I wanted to watch him in his element with his true friends.  But I wanted him to do that with me more."

"Are you still angry?"  Dorian asked.

I nodded.  "Yes and no.  I'm angry I was lied to.  But no, I can deal with his ex-lover.  I'm clearly the priority.  I'm the one in his bed.  I'm the one cooking him dinner and making his morning coffee.  I'm here, he's not.  **That** is enough for me."

"What happened the second time?"  Dorian asked as if he didn't know what had happened.

I sighed.  "We worked ourselves up into a frenzy at lunch between work sessions.  He's a stickler for not letting others know and we kinda stopped before things got started."

"Who stopped then?"

I grinned.  "I did."

"Why?"

I smiled.  "Because I knew how he felt and I want to keep him happy.  I want to do that more than I want to have sex with him."

Dorian laughed.  "Is that so?"

I nodded and smiled.   "Yes, love."  I felt strange calling Dorian that, calling anyone that but it kinda just came out.  Dorian's eyebrow quirked up as he heard my term of endearment.  His grin said he was more than happy for the slip of my tongue.  "I don't want to lose him.  I'm a mess.  He's so put together.  I just don't know why he'd stay after too long.  I'll screw something up.  But the only thing I can do is work on being a better boyfriend."

Dorian continued to listen intently not interrupting things he clearly wanted to say.  He really was trying to be a good therapist.  "And do you have a plan for that goal?" he asked.  I knew it was to keep me talking

I shrugged.  "I don't know.  I need to stop being me."  Dorian was about to say something but I kept talking and he clamped his mouth shut.  "I need to stop worrying whether or not I'm going to screw up and think about him more, what he'd think of me and my actions before I actually do them.  I don't want to hurt his carefully crafted image.  I don't want to make him hate me because I say something wrong at the wrong time or worse do something to embarrass him.  I'm just afraid he'll leave when he sees me for who I am really."

Dorian nodded.  "I think Margo would tell you, you are too hard on yourself.  You always see the worst in yourself."

"Doesn't everyone Dorian?"  I asked.  "I mean, you hide behind your mask of perfection because you don't feel you are good enough for your parents love and admiration because of the way your brain is wired.  I hide behind the obnoxious person, the loud outgoing kid who starts trouble because I don't want people to see the scared little boy that is always present.  I push people away because I don't want to get hurt.  I'm risking everything I know because I want **you** to be the one, Dorian.  I'm scared as hell you'll see that little boy and run away again.  I'm scared that without you I'm bound to live a tortured life.  You make me feel safe.  And each day that goes by I grow more and more in need of that feeling.  If I lose it..."

Dorian was turning me to face him before I could react.  Venatori speed be damned sometimes.  He was taking my face in his hands.  His fingers were soft against my skin as he pulled me in to kiss.  His lips caressed mine and he tasted wonderful.  He pulled from the kiss only to stare into my eyes.  His eyes danced with emotion I could barely read.  Dorian whispered.  "I'm not going anywhere, Nox.  **We** will get through this."

I grinned and chuckled.  "Some therapist you are; kissing your patients."  He rolled his eyes and I kissed him softly.  "Thank you.  And I know we will.  But you can't tell that to my brain it doesn't beleive you.  But I do."  I pushed Dorian gently way.  "Let me finish this."

Dorian chuckled and pretended to straighten his shirt as if I'd ruffled it in the push as he sat down.  "You mentioned Garrett and being Ascendant.  Do you want to talk about either of those?"

I shrugged.  "Garrett, no.  I've not seen him in weeks.  I'd like to keep him out of my thoughts despite what my brain thinks.  I did what he asked.  He's not done anything since."

Dorian nodded.  "And being Ascendant?"

I sighed and stared at Dorian across the way.  "Tell me what you think of the fact that I'm now classified as my own species.  I think Asher put it I was a preamble to a new race."

"Me?  This isn't about me?  You tell me what you think."  Dorian didn't want to weigh in.

"Please?"  I asked as I pushed a chicken salad sandwich at Dorian.  "Aidan, Drake.  Wash your hands."  The boys scappered off into the golden bathroom and Dorian set drinks on the bar we used for our meals.

Dorian shrugged.  "I don't know.  You are as you've always been.  Except now, people seem to notice you more.  The whispers and rumors have changed and they change daily."

I didn't care what other people thought of me and I let Dorian talk as I was pretty sure he was aware of that fact and was slowly getting to the point of his own views.  

He sighed as he sat down. "And those rumors and whispers are more positive.  I would be lying if I told you that it didn't made me feel better knowing that the guy who I was openly with wasn't looked down upon as much now."

I grinned at him.  "So I do hurt your image?"

Dorian frowned.  "Nox..."

"Dorian it's okay.  I know I do.  I will do my best to not embarrass you."

Dorian shook his head.  "No Nox.  This is not a one sided relationship.  You aren't the only one who needs to change.  **We** both have our issues and we will work on them together."  He grinned.  "You said I was so put together.  Do you know that I'm not what you see in me.  I'm not perfect, I don't even try to be. I'm just as much a mess as you are.  Insecure in my life choices.  Unsure of myself."

I laughed.  "You are a very good actor, Dorian. You fool everyone."

He smiled.  "I try."

Drake and Aidan came out flicking their still wet fingers at each other.  Then at Dorian who grimiced as a drop landed on his face.  They flicked at me and I flicked back, except mine wasn't a water droplet, as a small spalttering of water errupted from my fingers.  The boys giggled in delight which earned me a stern look from Dorian.  I grinned at him, "What, just cause you won't."

Dorian flicked his fingers at me to prove he could.  He'd been practicing with the boys, learning to craft the patterns he could see.  The pattern Dorian created was erratic and squirted all of us.  I grinned at his effort.  The boys tried to recreate what we'd done, but they weren't as fast at picking up patterns as Dorian was.  It was funny watching them try.  

Drake looked at his plate in front of him and then back up at me.  "Sandwiches for dinner?"

I smiled at him.  "Yeah.  You two ate too much this week.  We have nothing left."  It was a lie, we hadn't run out of food, it was what I had intended for the day to begin with.  Dorian and Drake had started complaining of the same thing every night.  Which wasn't the case every night, but they remembered all the vegetables I made them eat.  Neither really caring for them.

Aidan happily snacked away on the homemade sweet potato french fries.  He didn't eat with us every night.  Though he had been starting to this past week.

Drake started eating his sandwich making disgruntled noises as he ate boring food.  Dorian didn't look much happier and I grinned, maybe now they would be happy with what I made.
