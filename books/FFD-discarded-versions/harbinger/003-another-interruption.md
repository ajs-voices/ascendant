# Another Interruption
_Thursday, July 30, 2015 11:35 PM_

Our evening progressed as it usually did after dinner except this time we were in my apartment.  There was a distinct difference between my place and Dorian's, the biggest was mine didn't looked lived in.  I'd had it for only a few weeks and Dorian and my father had picked out the entire decor for it.  Nothing was mine.  

The segmented picture above my couch was that of New York City which Dorian thought I'd like.  It was a cool picture but not me.  The stone ware in my cupboards was picked out by Dorian too - a pristine orange and brown set which was really cool looking.  The floor was hard wood and painted a soft beige color.  It wasn't as bad as the color I had first lived in the studio a few floors down.  But still it was beige.

There were accents of orange all over the apartment, mostly in my bedroom, but still I found it everywhere.  It made me wonder how much Dorian had paid attention to the little things when I was a child.  He certainly knew I liked bright colors and orange was my favorite.

Drake happily played for a few hours before he was sent off to bed.  Dorian and I worked for a few hours more lounging on my couch.  Dorian working on whatever records he was maintaining, he kept flipping from the Academy database to his personal files.  I was flipping through pictures with my head resting on his leg and sprawled out on the rest of my couch.  

The pictures were drawing my attention.  I was seeing something but I couldn't pin point it.  Not really.  Dorian yawned as he was closing his laptop my cue to get up and go to bed.  I could stay up a little later, but  I'd still be up early no matter what time I went to bed.  My dreams either woke me early or my alarm did.  Either way I was up before the sun.

My thoughts from the previous conversation started.  Why did we not initiate romance in the wee hours of the evening when we could retire for the night.  No one would know.  But it was almost always the same.  Dorian would grab a shower and I'd end up in bed and nearly asleep by the time he returned.  I vowed to stay awake this time.  I didn't immediately climb into bed.  I sat on the edge of the bed while Dorian prepared for his shower.  I enjoyed watching him walk around gathering things, bending over and letting my mind wander.

He stood in the doorway to the bathroom.  He didn't move past the door frame, his hands gripping the molding.  I wished I could see his face to read what was going through his mind.  He spoke softly, "You know I was jealous of Anabel."

I stood up and walked over to Dorian and wrapped my arms around his waist resting my chin on his shoulder and whispred, "Why?"

Dorian chuckled but there was no humor in it.  It was a nervous laugh.  "Because you'd slept with her.  And..."

I kissed Dorian's ear and whispered, "We can fix that."

Dorian turned around and we stood staring into each other's eyes.  I pulled my t-shirt over my head and I could feel Dorian's eyes on my body.  His grip on the molding grew tighter as he refrained himself from touching me.  I grinned at him.  "Afraid love?"

He shook his head.  He licked his lips and just kept watching me.  I reached for him and he pulled back with a shake of his head.  "Not yet."

"What do you want of me love?"  

Dorian's leaned his head back and I watched his eyes roll back up in his head before he looked at me again.  There was fire and passion in his eyes and there was nothing more he wanted than me.  I wanted to touch him but he was not going to let me yet.  I unbutton my jeans and Dorian's eyes watched each movement.  I was not shy and I let Dorian watch as I removed my clothes slowly.  

My phone rang.  Dorian glanced at it and then back at me and when I continued to remove my jeans without reaching for the ringing nusance on the bed side table Dorian smiled.  The phone went silent leaving the room in a deadened silence.  I stood in front of Dorian in just my boxers.  

Dorian moved quickly.  I didn't have much chance to react before he had me against the bed post nearest us.  His fingers were tracing circles along my body when my phone rang again.  This time it was Margo.

We sighed.  Dorian scrambled across the bed and picked up my phone and answered it.  "This better be important, Dr. Silverman."

I could hear her on the other end.  "It is, Dorian.  I need to speak with Nox.  I'm sorry if I interrupted something.  But LouAnn Strickland said we had to call him."

Dorian slide the phone to speaker phone.  "You are on speaker phone Margo."  Dorian sat the phone in the middle of the bed and we both sat down away from each other, staring across the expanse that now separated us.  We were never going to get anywhere without interruptions.

"What's so important Margo?"  I asked fustration clear in my voice.

"Again, I'm sorry but it's Jo.  LouAnn Strickland says you need to be here now.  The full moon is approaching and Jo is worse than ever.  The pschye ward is no place for a werewolf to change."

"What do you want me to do?"  I could hear another voice in the background. 

"This is LouAnn.  Nox.  You are her Alpha you have to help."

I sighed.  "I don't know what I can do but I'll be there."  I looked at Dorian who was clooking at me with concern.

Dorian snatched the phone up and removed it from speaker phone.  He spoke in a white hot voice I hated.  "If you two get him killed I will find it with in my power to return the favor."  Dorian hung up my phone and looked at me with concern.  "You don't have to do this, Nox."

I frowned.  "Yes I do.  If she's my responsiblity I can't let her hurt someone else."

Dorian crawled over the bed and sat with one leg over my lap the other curled up underneath him against my back.  "Why is this so difficult for us?"

I laughed.  "It's not difficult for us, Dorian.  The cosmos are conspiring against us.  Keeping us from the best sex of our lives."

Dorian kissed my neck softly.  "Don't go."

I looked at him with pain in my heart.  "I want to stay."

Dorian nodded.  "I know.  And that's me being selfish.  But the little wolf makes me feel more jealous than Anabel."

"Dorian.  I've never done anything with Jo."

He placed a hand on my chest over my heart.  "I know.  And if there is oppurtunity for offspring, Nox, that is a sacrfice I will make but if she's tied to you in a way a true Alpha is tied to his pack then she is more than just a passing fling.  She's family."

"And that bothers you?"  I asked.

Dorian shrugged.  "I don't know.  I honestly don't know, Nox."

"If I go now, will that hurt us?"  I had to know.

Dorian leaned in and kissed me softly.  His lips brushing against mine, "No.  We are fine.  I know you, you are being torn up inside right now."  He wasn't wrong.  I was going through hoops in my head.  I wanted to stay with Dorian.  I didn't want to hurt him.  I couldn't let Jo hurt anyone else, but I couldn't hurt Dorian by leaving.  I knew my body was reacting to the anxiety.  "Calm down, Nox.  We will be okay.  I will stay with Drake.  You take care of Jo.  I will miss you and I might have to do something about certain things, but we will be okay."

I grinned.  "Don't have too much fun without me love."  

Dorian unfurled from my body with a kiss to my forehead before he strode into the bathroom.  "Call me if you need me, love."

My heart soared at the term of enderament he echoed at me and I nodded with a goofy grin on my face.  I got dressed, the same jeans and I pulled one of my clean hoodies over my naked chest, there really was no point for being more put together.

I checked in on Drake before I left.  His door was shut tightly and I opened it only a crack to see how he fared.  He was sleeping soundly and I could see the gentle rise of his chest which made me feel slightly better that Dorian and I wouldn't have distrubed the little dragon and had to explain what we were doing.  I sighed as I shut the door.  Everytime we tried to push the relationship beyond the beginning stages we were thrawted.  I didn't beleive in fate, but it seemed more and more like someone was trying to stop us from being together.

I took the elevator to the Psyche ward which wasn't really part of the Infirmary, it was a small subsection in the adult residences that was specifically designed to house the mentally ill and extremely dangerous Venatori abilities.  It amazed me that fire-starters weren't housed here, but there really wasn't anything mental about the issues a fire-starter has it's just education. 

I was greeted as the eleveators doors opened to a crowd of people standing outside waiting on me.  LouAnn Strickland, local were-creature educator and the only resident were-wolf besides Jo, Dr. Margo Silverman, mine and Jo's current therapist as well as Maddison Pratt, a nurse here in the ward.  She wasn't supposed to be on this late, but emergencies were just that and you called in everyone you needed to - which today included me.

Maddison took me by the arm.  "She's been acting more and more agressive each day.  I don't know what to do, we've had to restrain her and earlier tonight she broke them."

LouAnn stepped in beside me and shook her head.  "You can't restrain a change.  You'll hurt her and lose valuable equipment."

Maddison shook her head, "Too late for that."

LouAnn looked at me.  "The moon won't peak until tomorrow, but she's a fledgling, if she's going to turn she'll do it soon."

Maddison sighed, "She's never been this bad before."

I couldn't see the look on LouAnn's face as we were standing outside Jo's door and I was peering in.  "You shouldn't have kept her caged so long.  If I'd known I could have helped sooner."  LouAnn took me by the arm.  "If you are her true Alpha only you can help her."

I shook my head.  "I'm not a were anything I can't be a true Alpha."

LouAnn sighed.  "You better hope you are enough, or we will lose this girl tonight."

That wasn't going to happen.  I was going to make sure she didn't hurt anyone including herself tonight.  "Open the door and let me in."
