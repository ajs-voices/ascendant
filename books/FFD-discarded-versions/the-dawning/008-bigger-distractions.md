# Bigger Distractions
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 6:30 PM_

The walk to the hotel only helped my mood slightly.  It was good to finally walk somewhere instead of having to drive everywhere.  I passed two pizza places and a few Starbucks.  I stopped in at a Starbucks on the corner and grabbed a Tall Caramel Cocoa Cluster Frappuccino with coconut milk and no whipcream.  God, I missed this!

I sipped at my coffee as I walked into Pennsylvania Hotel and stopped at reception.  I probably should have changed, my 'Wanna screw?' t-shirt was hardly appropriate.  I pulled the zipper on my hoodie up to cover the image.  At least I could do that.  I hoped it wasn't hot up in Stella's room.

The woman at the front desk looked bored, she stared at her screen twirling her long straight brown hair.  She needed to pull it away from her face and neck, a pair of dangling earrings would look good against her long neck.  I sighed, seriously needed to get laid...

I smiled at the woman, her name was Elaine.  "I'm here to see Stella.  I didn't ask her last name, she's a toddler with her."  I pulled out my phone and looked for Stella's last call.  "She's in room 405?"

Elaine smiled at me, her teeth were yellowed from smoking more than likely I tried not to roll my eyes.  "Ms. Row said someone might be stopping by.  She said to send you up."  The woman nodded to me and pointed to a row of elevators, "You can take those up and you'll be almost there."  She looked down at some notes on her desk.  "Are you Nox?  You look like he described."

I laughed softly, "I was described how?"

She blushed, it was endearing.  "Tall, wearing a navy blue hoodie, blue jeans and a pair of worn Nike's - likely covering his offensive t-shirt."

I couldn't help laughing out loud.  I got shushed from a woman with a pettite little dog under her arm.  I smiled as I unzipped my hoodie and showed her the saying, she blushed again.  My smile grew wider as I put my elbow on the desk.  "Yes I'm Nox.  What did you need Duckling?"  I used my most seductive voice and was rewarded with a blush and a figdet from her hands.  

But she recovered quickly.  "Your friend called, said to bring this up with you."  She handed me a chilled bottle of wine.  Dorian... "It's paid for."  I grinned, of course it was.

"Thanks Elaine.  When he calls back, and I know he will, tell him exactly this, 'Thanks love, would rather drink with you.'"  I winked at her, let her figure that one out.  I headed towards the elevator that I was told to and sipped at my coffee as I tried not to think about the elevator.  I had plenty of other things to occupy my mind.  Dorian was trying to get me laid, I must be really bad if the proud and proper Scrin was trying to insure I had a good time on my not a date.  I had a perfectly good human girl waiting on me and I couldn't get that man out of my head.  He was almost as confusing as Stella was.

I knocked on room 405 and I heart "Shit!" called out from the otherside of the door.  I was chuckling to myself when Stella opened the door with a plush white tower wrapping her red locks and another wrapped around her chest.  My eyes wandered down she wasn't wearing much underneath the towerl either.  I let my gaze rise slowly and grinned at her.  I wanted to her to know I approved but I wouldn't take another peek, or at least I'd try not to.  

She laughed, "At least you aren't trying to hide it."  She opened the door wider, "Come on in, let me get dressed."

I walked in to her posh room.  It was hardwood floors, the bedding was already rumbled in her single queen size bed, there was a couch and a table, and the playpen in the middle of the floor held a sleeping baby.  I walked back towards the bathroom and leaned against the adjoining wall.  I could have stood in the doorway she'd left open but I'd behave myself on this not-a-date.

I grinned happily, "You didn't have to shower for me."

Stella laughed, it was infectious and my smile grew.  "If I told you it wasn't because you were coming over I'd be lying, but I showered a few hours ago.  Aidan has been a royal terror since we got in."

I chuckled softly, "We'll at least he's sleeping now."

She poked her head out the door, her hair was still wet but she wore a green camasole and a pair of black jeans.  I could see the straps of her panties over the top of her hip huggers and grinned to myself.  She smiled at me as she snuck back into the bathroom, "Thank god.  I really didn't know what I was going to do with him."

"He would have been fine.  I'm not breakable."  I teased.

She laughed, "He can bench press his truck now.  Did you get things straightened out?"

I shook my head but I knew she couldn't see, "No.  My day got worse too."

Stella came out with a black see through wrap over her green camasole but that was the only other change to her attire that I could notice since she poked her head out before.  She had taken the time to put on a little make up and I felt slightly underdressed now.  

She plucked the bottle of wine from my hand.  "Wine and coffee?"

I laughed softly as we walked into the other room.  "I bought the coffee on the way over.  My friend called and ordered the wine."

"Jason?" she asked with a flip in her voice, like she expected there to be more to us than meets the eye.

I laughed, "No, like I said he went home to his wife.  Just another friend, who knew you'd like wine."

She grined at me, "At least he understands women better than you."

"You have no idea, Stella."

Stella frowned, "Don't tell me he's gay?"

I nodded with a smile, "He is."  I handed her two plastic cups from near the ice container.  "The best I can offer."

Stella took them and poured two glasses of wine and took a big swig of it before she refilled hers.  How easy it would be to get her in bed.  I pushed the thought away as quickly as it came as I took a sip of the wine.  She commented, "Good vintage."

I smiled, "If you say so.  I'm more a beer guy."

"That doesn't surprise me.  Food should be here soon."  Stella walked closer to me and smiled up at me.  I swallowed hard she was making me want to do bad things to her just by standing near her.

"Your friend.  You like him?"  She was ever inquisitive about my life.

"You sure are curious about me."  She smiled up at me and I sighed, "Yes.  I like him.  He's far more attractive than I remember."  Not to mention the fact that Dorian just has something about him right now that pulls me towards him, but I didn't say that.

She sighed with releif and I knew what was coming next, "I want to set the stage right now before you get the wrong idea."

I closed the distance between us and put my finger to her lips to quiet her.  "You don't have to say it.  I know the words already.  You want to be friends.  It's not you, it's me."  I grinned at her and she looked like I'd hurt her, I stepped away.  "It's alright, I really didn't come her looking to get laid.  Disappointed a little, if you hadn't traveled with Aidan I would have tried, but I'm not _that_ guy."

She still looked hurt, "You hear that a lot?  Why did you come then?"

I took a deep breath, "I was encouraged by my friend to clear my head.  And no, I don't hear that a lot.  I don't hit on people who would generally say no."

She frowned, "So you weren't hitting on me?"

I shurgged, "I was, I didn't expect to see you again.  It was safe.  I didn't think you'd like some punk kid."

"You aren't a punk kid."  She put her hand against my cheek and I pulled it way.

"I am.  You just don't know me."  I stepped away, "I should go, this was a bad idea."

Stella caught my arms and I froze, the painful memories started to come to the surface and I stamped them down with a large hammer.  She moved around to look up at me, "You don't have to.  We can be friends."

I rolled my eyes, "I'm not that gay friend every girl has."  I pulled my arm from her.

Stella laughed but it was strained, "No, but you know New York better than I do.  If I get the job you'll be the only person I know. Please don't go like this."

A knock came and Stella smiled, "And besides the food is here now, there is no point in it going to waste.  If you want to go when we are finished that's okay."

I nodded, "Alright."

The bell hop pushed the cart into the room and lifted the lid.  I smiled burgers and fries.  Stella smiled shyly, "I figured everyone likes burgers."

"Not wrong there."  I tipped the bell hop and set the lids to the side and pulled the cart close to the couch.  I took a bite and found it passable.  I could do better.  But I kept my thoughts to myself.  Stella had thought I'd come to take advantage of her.  She dressed to kill and she turned me down, my self esteem was just plumetting.  I really needed to just go home, throw a few more fireballs or punch the bag.  I could call Margo.

"Tell me about your friend?"  Stella inquired, more questions about me.

I sighed, "I'd rather not talk about it."  I felt like crap, it was showing through my normal upbeat exterior, I needed to go home.

Stella frowned, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..."

I shook my head, "It wasn't you, my day has gotten shittier and shittier since I woke up."

"Do you want to talk about it?"  

I laughed, "Why does everyone think I want to talk about things?  Thanks but no.  I've an appointment with my shrink tomorrow, I'll talk then.  I should go."

Stella frowned, "You didn't finish."

I shrugged as I stood up, "I lost my appetite.  I'm sorry.  Call me tomorrow, I'll be in a better mood.  Let me know how the inteview went."

She was looking down at the plate, she was frowning, "I'm surprised you care."

I frowned, "I'm having a bad day.  I care if you get the job, I am just not good company.  I'm sorry."

I headed for the door and I could hear Stella make some sort of sound.  I turned around and I saw a tear sliding down her cheek.  "I'm sorry.  Please, call me tomrrow.  But I'll understand if you don't."

Stella frowned, "I'm sorry this didn't go as planned.  I..."

I smiled at Stella and walked back to her and knelt down in front of her, "Shhh.  It's okay.  I'm not the kinda guy you want to get to know, Stella.  I've not had a solid relationship in... ever.  And you know more about me than most people I've slept with already. You don't want to know me."

She punched me in the shoulder, she looked like she wanted to yell.  I could feel the panic rising inside and I put on a grin.  I fought to keep my calm around me, to stay in my happy place.  "You are a shit you know that.  You can't say one nice thing about yourself, it's no wonder you've never had a relationship, just meaningless sex."

I shrugged and stood up, she had me pegged already and I smiled.  "I'm okay with that."

Stella frowned, "Get out...."  She turned away from me and I sighed.  "Please."

I did as she asked.  I dropped some cash on the cart and hoped it was enough to cover the whole bill.  As I walked out the door my phone buzzed.  I shut the door and once I stepped into the elevator I looked at my phone, Dorian sent me a text, 'She's getting antsy, you should come back soon.'

I sighed of course I wasn't going to get to calm down.  I typed Dorian a message, 'On my way.  Thanks for the wine.  Got shot down before I got in the door.'

The elevator dinged and I stepped out into the lobby and started my walk back to the compound.
