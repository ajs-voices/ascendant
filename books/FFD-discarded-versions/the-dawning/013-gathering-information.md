# Gathering Information
_Monday, June 15, 2015 10:30AM_

I could go see Jace and his class now, but it was probably better to get some more work done.  I didn't really get anywhere yesterday, but I did have some new thoughts now.  What if among the Exuli there were Magnus who were working with one of the two that Kai and Emilio had a hand in?  It was a thought, and one that I'd have a hard time making ends meet without my computer.

So I headed towards the Archives.  The archives was full of written records and up until recently had been run by the old fashioned card catalog systems.  Now everything was digitized and searchable, but the archives were still up todate with every record ever created, even digitally.  It was some lowly technical savvy Scrin's job to print the reports and make sure everything was up todate in the archive records.  An audious task but necessary.  God forbid the apocolypse happened. And yes, the Venatori beleived one day technology would fail.  A long lived supernatural race beleived in a great many things, and it was that fear that kept us on task.

As I walked into the Archives I was still amazed at the shear number of books and tomes that lined the walls.  There were rows upon rows of shelvings, all filled to the brim with books.  We may not live forever like the Aeternus that started this mission, but their records lived on in us and we followed our purpose without hesitation. 

In the center of the first room there was a woman, she had goregeous green eyes that were only enhanced by the bronzing of her skin and the white of her smile.  Her eyes sparkeled as she smiled at me when she noticed I'd walked in.  I'd been in here before but I was much younger.  I recognized the woman but I couldn't put a name to the face.  She had aged well, but you could tell she tried to dye her graying hair.  She smelled like honey dew melon and something sweet I couldn't place, but it wasn't offensive in the least.  It was oddly comforting.  

I smiled at her as I approached the desk. I noticed the long emerald green pendants dangling from silver chains along her long neck, she was exquisit.  Though not a woman even remotely in my ball park as the ring on her left ring finger spoke of her holy matrimony.  She looked a faithful woman.  

She smiled, "I didn't expect to see you here."

I frowned playfully, "Why not?"  She knew who I was, I was at a disadvantage, I disliked that feeling.  But she was friendly enough my defense mechanisms didn't kick into gear, at least not right away.

"Your father was very adamant you not be brought into this.  But you are probably one of the most tech savvy of the hunters, I expect your computers could do the work faster."  The smile never left the woman's mouth, she was kind and motherly and she clearly knew me well.

I stated the obvious, "So you know who I am then, and why I'm here?" 

The woman nodded, "Yes.  You are Nox SÃ©tanta.  My son speaks highly of your abilities as both Magnus and venatori alike."

There was only one person who spoke highly of my skills and that was Dorian Vega.  He was the only one who thought I was special and unique.  Everyone else pretty much thought I was inferior, unworthy of breathing the same air.

I grinned at her, "And that would make you Dolores Vega."  She offered me her hand I shook firmly and then kissed the middle knuckle.   "You are exactly the person I need.  I'm looking into family history.  Viddens, Vegas and as many Exuli as I possibly can get my hands on.  There is a connection, I just need to find it."

Mrs. Vega put a finger to her lip and I noticed the matching emerald nail polish adorning the long finger nail.  She tapped he finger against her lip and I was only reminded of her sons lush lips.  I sighed and she gave me a glance.  I shook my head, nothing was wrong, only that the man I'd grown up trusting my life too was now plauging my waking thoughts in very uncharateristic ways.

I had to keep my mind on task.  But being with Mrs. Vega that was going to be difficult.  The similiarites in the two were too much.  Dorian was not a girly man.  He was very much the perfect image of masculinity.  If you didn't know him you'd hardly suspect he preferred the company of men.  Such was his image, and I was well aware that his image was his life.  There was no room for a little punk like me.  

My mood fell but Dolores Vega smiled and the world lit back up.  I would have to do something about this infatuation with Dorian, but right now I had work to do.  "Come with me, I think you'll find all the information you need in the Ancenstry room.  I won't be easy.  Why are you doing this by hand?"

I grinned, "My laptop went for a tumble.  And this is the least likely place for my father to find me."

She nodded, "Perhaps that is true.  And avoiding him is key?"

"Not really.  I figure if I stay away from him he can't beat me over the head with the whole not wanting me around."

She lead me down a few aisles and to a room with nothing on the door.  She opened it and flipped on the light.  The florscent bulbs flickered and blinked as they finally clicked on fully.  I had always hated those type lights, they were hard to read by and they made everything yellow.  But beggers can't be choosers and I was certainly not the one who had control over renovations.  The musty smell of a unused room hit me like a wall and I tried not to let it show on my face.

On the table just inside the room there was a pile of books.  She smiled at me, "I think what you are looking for might be on the table.  Dorian was here two days ago searching through Kai's and his father's records.  He too thought this was a good place to hide from those who didn't want him poking his nose into things."

I grinned, "Of course he would."  

Mrs. Vega then pointed to a section in the back corner, "Over there is where you will find the records on the Exuli most recently exiled - with in the past 100 years or so."

I nodded my thanks.  "I thank you for your help."

I started into the door but Mrs. Vega caught my arm and I turned to her, "You beleive Dorian is correct?"  

I nodded, "It makes sense, he is the reknowned expert on Cesari.  I trust his judgement."

She nodded, "Kai beleives that it is coincidence it is our families are being targeted, high profile hunters."

I nodded, "It's possible.  But then the Rivera's should also be targeted yes?  They are high profile too."

"Possibly, don't limit yourself to one belief or another.  I heard through the grape vine that a certain young man is awake.  And I also have it on good source that your father and my husband are out of the building, if you wished to speak with him about what he saw.  Your time with the boy will be limited, now is the perfect oppurtunity.  These books can wait."

I smiled.  "Kai's son...I think I'll do that."  She nodded. "Thank you Mrs. Vega for your assistance."  

I turned off the light and shut the door and we walked back to the front of the Archives chatting about nothing in particular.  It was good to speak so freely with someone.  It wasn't something I would usually do.  She reminded me very much of her son, someone I could confide in and know he wasn't judging me.

I left Mrs. Vega with a flourishing bow which sent the young girl at the desk into fits of giggles Mrs. Vega had to shush.  I chuckled to myself as I walked out the door.

The Infirmary was several flights below but I took the stairs anyway, it was habit.  It was also good exercise and I didn't have any panic attacks.

Life with the Venatori had its ups and downs.  We didn't own anything, we didn't earn money as the outside world did.  There was no need, we were completely cared for with in the confines of the compound.  We wanted for nothing.  If we needed a new computer we could requisition one, sometimes you were told no, but most of the time you given everything at the mere request of it.

We even had our own research hospital on campus.  Most stations didn't have that, but they had their own infirmary - a place for emergencies and well care of us.  But here, our infirmary doubled as a research facility.  The research went from cures for cancer to the physiology of a dragon.  It was rather epic if you thought about it.  But I wasn't here for that.

I stopped at the front desk and asked, "I'm here to see Kai Vidden's boy.  I'm family."

The woman looked up with her smokey brown eyes and frowned, "Relation?"

"I'm his brother."  It felt extremely odd saying that out loud.  I of course had known I had brothers and a sister here in the compound.  I'd learned that when I had found out I had a father.  I hardly knew any of my blood relatives.

She handed me a badge that said visitor and directed me to ICU on the second floor, she gave me a room number too.  "Take care, he is awake, but don't over stress him."

I nodded at the instructions and took the stairs up to the second floor of the Infirmary.  I found his room and had to double check the room number because the name on the door said Nicholas Hampton - not a Vidden.  

I sighed.  Nick was my brother.  No wonder Dae'lin had done what she did.  I walked into his room after knocking on the open door.  "Hey man."

He looked up and his eyes spoke to the pain he was in.  Burns sucked.  I remembered mine all too well, they itched at the memories.

He smiled and it looked like it hurt to do that simple thing, "Hey Nox, what you doing here.  Only family's allowed."

I nodded, "Hey bro.  At least that's what you are technically - my half brother."

Nick processed the information and frowned.  "So... that's awkward."

I laughed as I pulled up a chair to sit closer to Nick.  I put my hand on his and patted softly before putting my hand on the edge of the bed instead of resting it on his.  He was my brother despite the intamcy we'd shared as young boys.  

It was harmless fun, but the knowledge that I made out with my brother makes me squirm and it apparently made Nick squirm too.

I smiled.  "You've looked better."

Nick grinned at me, "You look a bit worse for wear too."  He ran his finger down his own face indicating where my scar ran.

"Disgruntled ghost possessing a girl.  Her knife got a peice of me before I removed the culprit and extinqueished the poltergeist.  And that's not even the worst of them."

Nick nodded, "Anything as exciting as a bomb blowing up in your face?"  He was joking.  Nick was a tech consultant, he was damn good at his job too.  He set up a great number of the new systems in Boulder during the retro fit there this past November.

"Dragon fire comes the closest."  I lifted my leg and pulled my left pant leg to my knee and he whistled.  

"At least you healed."

I grined, "You'll heal too.  It doesn't feel like it now, but you look pretty damn good considering it happened only a short time ago.  I'd probably still be on morphin drip."  There was an uncomfortable silence as we pondered our own thoughts.  

I finally interrputed the silence, "I hate to bother you but can I ask you a few questions?"

He nodded, "Father said you might be by and that I could make my own decisions."

I laughed, "He did, did he? So may I?"

He nodded and he winched in pain and I frowned.  

"Thanks.  You remember anything about the package?"

Nick grabbed his glass of water and took a small sip from it.  I knew the pain I saw on his face all to well but he answered me anyway, "It was a regular package.  But it didn't look like it had come from the mailroom, but it was stamped and everything so I guess it had.  A kid handed it to me.  Had my name on it and everything."

"You don't think it came from the mailroom?"

Nick shrugged, "It was just a feeling I had, why else would a kid give it to me.  I guess it was delivered incorrectly.  It happens."

"The kid you remember who it was?  What he looked like?"

Nick shook his head, "I didn't know him.  He's new, still in high school, I think.  Dark hair, that's all I really remember."

"Thanks man.  I appreciate it.  I hope this goes quickly for you.  Burns suck."

Nick nodded, "Thanks man.  And thanks for stopping by.  Though I'd rather you weren't my brother."  He winked at me suggestively.  I grinned at him.  We would have had a good time.  I swallowed hard, that wasn't going to happen ever now.  Nick looked lost in thought, "Father doesn't like the fact that I'm gay."

"I can imagine.  He probably blames me for turning you gay."

Nick smirked, "He does.  He never says it in so many words, but when he speaks of it, it's always, if he hadn't kissed you like that, you'd be fine. I don't blame you.  You weren't even the first guy I kissed.  Just the only one I got caught kissing."  Nick added, "At least you actually like girls though."

I sighed, "It doesn't help that much really.  The fact that I like guys gets the most attention."

Nick laughed softly trying not to hurt himself, "Then stop being all 'oh I like guys' at every turn."

I grinned, "But that's me.  I like making people uncomfortable."

He nodded, "I know.  Thanks for coming by." I nodded and waved farewell.  

As I was about to shut the door Nick called out my name.  "Hey Nox?"  I turned to look at him and he smiled, "Maybe when I'm outta here we can hang out.  Just me and you - brothers.  Go dancing, have a drink, pick up some guys?"

I smiled, "Yeah sure thing Nick.  We can hang out when you are out of here, though the dancing and guys might have to wait a little longer than that."  I waved to him again, "See you round bro."

It felt odd, but it felt good too.  To actually have family that actually liked me that was blood.  I had enough family, but I might start liking having more.
