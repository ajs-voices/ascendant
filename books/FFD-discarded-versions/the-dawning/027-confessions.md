# Confessions
_Tuesday, July 14, 2015 7:15PM_

Sleep brought on my normal nightmares with a soft interlude that woke me from my sleep.  I blinked my eyes open.  My mouth was parched, my stomach hurt.  I had no idea what time it was.  There were no clocks in my room.

I glanced to the side when I heard typing on the keyboard.  I grinned.  "Hey stranger, glad to see you up and moving about."  

Dorian jumped at the sound of my voice.  A look of relief washed over his features.  Worry was not a good look on Dorian, but his eyes were bright now.  "You too.  Jason said you were awake, but when I got here you'd passed back out again."

"Sorry.  The drugs they are giving make me tired I think."  I grinned playfully at him.

Dorian shook his head.  "We've been worried about you."

"Who's we?"  I asked, really how many people cared if I lived or died.

Dorian frowned.  "Everyone."

I rolled my eyes.  "Now that's a lie.  Everyone doesn't care about me."

Dorain stood up with a sigh, "You are ever so hard on yourself.  Specifically, those worried about you were first and foremost - me.  Your father and mine have been here nearly as much as I have.  Jace spends his lunch hour and some time before he goes home here.  The doctors and nurses are all dumbfounded by you."  He grinned at me like he was not at all surprised by my miraculous healing.  "There is probably a line waiting outside the Infirmary of all sorts of people waiting on you to get better so they can talk to you."

"Oh yay!  I'm a celerety now."  I rolled my eyes.  There were several bags and a tray of food on the table by the door.  "That all mine?"

Dorian looked at the table and nodded.  "You hungry?"  It was rhetorical because he hadn't even waited for me to answer before he picked up the bags and the tray and carried them over to the bedside rolling table.  He set the tray down first and then started pulling containers out of the bags.  "Jace, your dad, me and I think the Doc all brought you food.  I guess we all thought you would be hungry."

I laughed.  "I'm famished."

Dorian nodded.  "With all that energy you've been expending I'm surprised you aren't skin and bones, your body turning on itself."

"So you understand what's happening?"  I asked before stuffing a peice of bread in my mouth.  It was stale and soggy but it was food.

Dorian pulled the chair over and sat down.  "Not really.  I only know what I see."

The hospital food was just boring.  I opened one of the containers Dorian had unpacked and found a bow tie pasta with garlic lemon shrimp sauce.  It smelled to die for even though it was cold.  I searched the mess of stuff in front of me for a fork and didn't find one.  So I used my fingers.  

Dorian laughed and pulled a fork from the tray and handed it to me with a roll of his eyes.  "Thanks.  What do you see?"

Dorian smiled, "Patterns converging in on you.  Like a steady stream of them."

That's what I thought was the cause of my miraculous healing.  Though I wasn't sure how that worked without someone actively supplying me the raw resources.  I shrugged.  "Like what I did to you and Emilio?"

Dorian shook his head, "I don't know, I didn't see what you did to me."

I nodded and took the fork and drew it across my forearm.  Dorian jumped to my side but I told him, "Just watch."  I laid all the elements over my skin and Dorian watched as my scratch knitted itself back together faster than any Venatori.

He nodded but stared at my arm.  He ran his fingers over where it had been, smearing blood along my arm.  His touch sent shivers down my spine.  He had no idea what he did to me.  Dorian picked up the napkin and wiped his fingers then my arm and threw it in the red bin in the room.  "No need to worry someone else."  He said absently.

Dorian sat down still staring at my arm.  "Exactly like that."  He looked up at me with more questions.  "People are going to have a lot of questions."

I sighed, "The doc has already said she wants to run more tests.  I reluctantly agreed.  You will want to know more, I already expected that.  Do I really need to talk to more people?"

Dorian moved closer putting his hand on my arm, "This is unprecidented, people will want to know."

His touch was electric, my heart raced and I heard the monitors recording it.  I tried to pull my arm from him, "Please don't do that."  Dorian looked confused and then pulled his hand from arm.  I missed his touch.  I put the topic back on track, "I'm not some guinea pig to be tested and scored."

Dorian looked at me with sadness in his eyes.  "I know, but..."

I shook my head.  "No, Dorian, you and the doc.  No one else."

"Nox..."

"Dorian.  No." I didn't mean to raise my voice and Dorian pulled away completely from me sitting in his chair proper.  I turned away.  I didn't like the look on his face.  He was looking at me like I was a stubborn child.  Maybe I was being one, but I didn't like that look on his face.  His lips pursed together, like he was fighting heated words.  A heat to his eyes I'd only seen once before.  I sighed, "Fine."  I looked at him and his face was still angry with me, "If it means that much to you.  Whatever you want Dorian."

He frowned, the anger fleeing with it.  "I... Why?"

I stabbed the pasta in the styrofoam container and the fork poked four tiny holes in the packaging and was now dripping all over me.  I sighed.  "Because I can't stand that look on your face.  I never liked when you were disappointed in me as a child, and right now I don't want to make you unhappy."

Dorian offered me a napkin and took the container from me, and transfered the contents to an extra plate on the tray.  He was treating me like a child.  I sighed.

"Why would you not want to make me unhappy?"  Dorian was truly and utterly oblivious.

I sighed, "You really don't know?"  I shook my head.  "Just friends, I got it."  I tried to hide the bitterness in my voice.

"That's why you'd talk to people you don't want to.  Because you think I want that?"  He almost sounded angry at me.

I looked over at Dorian, I wanted to stand up or throw something at him.  But that would just prove to him I was just being childish.  I was such a child sometimes.  I shook my head and frowned, "No Dorian.  I would do it because you asked me to."  I whispered, "I'd do anything for you."  I turned away and poked at the plate Dorian had given me.  My appetite was gone again.

I could feel Dorian staring at me as he sat there in silence.  So I filled the silence, "But I get it Dorian.  It's not going to happen."  I turned to him and I don't know what I saw on his face - it was empty of anything I recognized.  My heart fell in my chest.  "But I'd still do whatever you asked of me.  I always will.  Call it our history, whatever you want.  But you mean more to me than anyone else who calls me family."

It was a simple question, quietly asked, "Why?"

"You saved me."

Dorian laughed, "I have done no such thing."

A tear slide down my cheek, he really didn't know, "You have done so all my life.  You rescued me from the hatred of my mother.  You were there the night I lost my best friend when I got here.  You were there the day I found out I was Cesari and the only one to actually sit down with me and explain anything about what it meant.  You encouraged me to conquer my fears.  You were there at my Ad Aetatem when I was freaking out because of the drug.  You keep away my nightmares.  Just the scent of you makes me feel safe.  And every one of those things happened when I was just a kid to you.  But every one of those moments pale in comparison to holding you when **you** needed someone.  So don't tell me you haven't saved me."  

My voice rose with the heated emotion.  I don't know if it was anger at him or at myself, "I fell fucking in love with you after sleeping on your couch.  Dorian, I don't want to be **just** friends."  I turned away from him wiping the tears away that were falling from my eyes.  I hated admitting my insecurities and every last feeling inside.  I wanted to walk out of the room but I didn't think I'd get very far.

We sat in near silence, the beeping of the monitors the only sounds.  My stomach rumbled despite feeling sick to it.  I picked up the pasta again and started eating slowly.  The sound of my fork hitting the fake china plate adding to the beeps from the machines monitoring my vitals.  I chewed slowly.  I wasn't trying to savor the taste, I was trying to keep it down.  Energy needed to be replenished.

I ate in silence.  Dorian started to fidget.  I was making him uncomofrtable.  He started to say something, he only got out "I" before he stopped himself.  I turned and gave him a weak smile.  "Don't say anything.  If you don't want to be here just go."

Dorian leaned forward in his chair and ran both of his hands through his hair.  I was glad that he was having issues with the whole situation.  It could be hope, or fuitile, but at least there was hope.  He sat there while I finished the plate of pasta and I started opening up another container.  It was the same dish I'd had with Dorian a month ago.  I smiled as I picked out a piece of chicken with my fingers and started eating it.  

Dorian looked up at me with a sad look on his face.  He needed to go, to think, I could see it written all over his face.  I nodded and Dorian stood up and moved for the door.  My heart fell.  His hand was on the door knob but I didn't want to leave it like that.  My anger was rising but I had beared my soul to him and I felt raw and empty now, but the hurt on his face made me weep inside.  I looked down at the foot of my bed, "Dorian."  He looked over his shoulder, he didn't really turn to look at me.  I looked up at him.  "I'm glad your Dad made it through this okay.  I wouldn't want you to lose them both so close together."  I saw a tear slide down his cheek as he nodded and muttered thanks and slipped out the door.

My anger unfurled itself as I flung the rolling table with all the food on it across the room.  The containers scattered and there was a mess.  I tried to curl up but it hurt too bad so I put the pillow over my head and wished I'd died.
