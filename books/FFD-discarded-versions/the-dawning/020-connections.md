# Connections

I was half way to my rooms when I caught the distinct sight of a small gym.  I stopped outside the propped open door and peired inside.  I could use a short work out, vent some of my fustration.    My neck was a little sore from sleeping on the couch.  I was surprised my back wasn't sore too.  I smiled at the memories of what little dreams I remembered having.  I remembered the scents most, but that had been Dorian's pillow.  I rubbed the back of my neck out of reflex.

A voice from behind me made me jump, "Rough night?"

I turned around and saw my father smirking at me.  He was carrying a bunch of files, a towel and a bottle of water.  He was dressed to work out.  He looked like he was going to work and work out at the same time.  I had done it many times, apparently it ran in the family.

I grinned at him, "Sleeping on the couch does that."  I stepped away from the door but Kai stood where he was.  He looked at me like he knew where I was and he thought I was lying.

"While you are here."  Kai handed me the files he'd been carrying and he went inside putting the rest of his things on the bench as he started warming up with stretches.  "Talk to me.  Why are these files important to you?"

I took a look at the files and noticed that these were the same files I had been working.  I looked down at my father stretching and he just shrugged.  He didn't bother explaining why he'd taken my work.  

"These are Dorian's files on Cesari and me and others like me.  They are how he came to his theory.  These files are from Mrs. Vega about the two cases of yours and Emilio that could possibly fit Dorian's theory.  But since none of them can bend all the elements only thing I can figure is it's Exuli helping out.  It would fit with Dorian's theory."

"I haven't had time to go through the files yet as the fire alarms went off, and then we went on a scavenger hunt for the baseball hats."

Kai had moved from stretches to shadow boxing.  I watched him as he moved flawlessly from form to form.  He moved with precision and speed I was envious of.  I could have the precision, but the speed not so much.  "What are these two cases you think are connected?"

"They are two exiles you were party to.  One was a woman whom you carried out kicking and screaming.  The other you escorted calmly to Texas."

Kai nodded.  "Okay.  But none of them are Magnus."

I nodded my head in confirmation, "Correct."

"Where are they located?"

I looked through their files.  "Mrs. Cox hasn't checked in for about 30 years.  She was last in Chicago with a daughter and her son was exiled with her.  The others checked in two months ago still in Africa where they fled to." I smirked, "Preaching the word of God!"

Kai laughed, "How ironic.  Looks like Chicago is our link."

I nodded.  "Seems to be a good start."

Kai took the papers from my hands and set them down on the bench, "You came here for a reason?"

I smirked, "I was doing that when you rudely took the files away."

Kai laughed and shook his head, "I meant the here and now.  Outside the gym."  He still looked like he thought I was lying about sleeping on the couch.

"I guess.  I was debating it."  I sighed, "Haven't had a good workout in a few weeks.  Sleeping on couches and on the ground isn't good on the back.  And trees don't make good workout equipment."  I grinned, "Too many splinters."

Kai smiled at me, "Show me what you got boy."

I laughed, "Yeah I learned along time ago not to go up against a full Venatori.  I prefer to keep the bruises I get to a minimum.  Not too good for picking up the ladies"

"Or the men, I imagine."  Kai said dryly.

"Ha!  Kai making a joke at my expense, how new." I spouted before I could catch myself.  I was mildly surprised to see that Kai was just grinning at my comment.  I sighed, "Fine."

I took off my shoes and socks, it was easier to work on the mats barefoot, and there was something freeing about not having socks on.  I pulled my shirt over my head and heard Kai whistle. "Damn Boy!"

I frowned.  I was a little concerned about my father when he nodded towards my chest. I looked down and saw the black and blue bruise from where Aaron had landed his lucky punch.  "Like I said, I like to keep my bruises to a minimum."

"You get into fights often?"

I laughed, "Not as often as I used to.  I was beat on pretty regularly by my roommates."

"You let them hit you?"  He sounded concerned, like I was letting myself get beat.  And in a way I was.  At times I had let them hurt me, but I didn't have control.  They'd triggered the reflex Garrett had instilled in me.  But that didn't happen often.

I shrugged, "It's better that way.  When the big black man punches me first my defense of myself does't come off as me being the bully.  Because I will always win."  I grinned at Kai.

He flashed a proud smile.  "I'm sure you do."

Kai was done talking as he threw a punch and I barely moved in time.  I still wasn't fast enough as my father's fist landed in my chin.  I could feel the bruise starting to form.  I rubbed the spot.  "You really do suck at this."

"I told you I learned along time ago I wasn't going to win with my skill and speed alone.  I needed a little help."

Kai laughed, "You cheat, in other words."

I shook my head, "Not realy.  I use my gift."

Kai nodded he looked lost in thought.  I wondered if he was remember what I had done to him in the hall way."  "If you singe a hair on my head I will kill you out right."

I grinned and laughed, "I'd like to see you try, Kai."

"Stop calling me Kai."

I sighed, "Would you prefer sir, or Mr. Viddens then.  Because I'm sure as hell not calling you Dad or Father or any other such endearmeant.  I could call you a few choice words if you prefer."

Kai sighed, "Is that the only other option.  You either insult me or take such formality I search for my father?"

I laughed, "And yet another thing we have in common.  But yes, that is the only other options."

Kai nodded, "Fine.  Kai will work - for now, boy."

I laughed, "Do I dare ask you not to call me boy?  I've not been a boy for several years now."

Kai nodded, "Fair is fair.  Now if you don't mind, Nox.  Let's spar."

The use of my name caught me off guard as Kai threw a series of punches.  I managed to block the blows with a shield of air and Kai exclaimed, "That will take getting used to."  I grinned, "Wipe that grin off your face."

We started circling one another.  Kai threw another punch and I dodged his hands would have made contact if I hadn't put the shield of air up to deflect his course.  

Series after series of punches came at me, he was trying to whip the grin off my face.  I couldn't help but grin wider.  It was more fun to taunt my tormentors than not to.

Kai was so focused on his mission that he wasn't expecting it when I dropped to the ground and swiped my leg underneath him and he fell to his back.  I stood above him and tried not to smirk as I offered him a hand up.

He took it out of spite I'm sure.  He probably didn't like the idea of me helping him, but it was sportsman like and we were trying to be civil to one another.

We started again this time Kai started a series of blows faster than I could see.  Many were blocked but a few landed as I wasn't quick enough to move the shield from place to place as Kai changed directions.  I was having a hard time breathing and I needed to end the onslaught, I pushed my hands in front of me a wave of air moved towards Kai and he flew backwards landing on his back again.

I gasped for breath as I walked over to him and offered him a hand up again.  He took it and sat up, "Air benders see you a mile away don't they?"

I nodded.  I couldn't breathe still.  Kai stood up and tossed me my shirt.  "One day I'd like to watch you work all the elements like that."

I nodded finally able to talk again, "I'm sure you'll have ample oppurtunity once we catch this guy."

Kai smiled and headed for the door with his bottle of water and his towel around his shoulders.  "Let me know what you find in the files.  I'll leave it to you since you have a handle on the theory.  I will be questioning our inside man suspects again today.

I sighed.  My father was gone just as fast as he had come into my morning.  I was left with the need to shower even more than before, but I'd found a bit more respect for my father.  I would try to do better around him.
