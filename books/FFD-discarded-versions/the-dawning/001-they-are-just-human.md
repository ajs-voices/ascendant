# They Are Just Human
_Saturday, June 13, 2015 8:35 PM_

The air in the room became thick with testosterone as the men who had been placid before took up arms for their fellow local.  She'd called to two men - a Barry and a Lex, but three men approached me, including the bartender and he had a shotgun.  

I barely had time to stand up before they were descending upon me.  I raised my hands to show I was defenseless.  "I'm not here to kill her.  I swear to god."  I knew wasn't defenseless, I had learned to hide my gift in a fight, but they didn't know that and I really didn't want to reveal too much about my own kind.  That could land me on the other side of the Venatori as well.  

My back was to the bar.  The room was shrinking around me. I turned and now my back towards the door and started backing up before they could close in around me.

A scraggly man wearing overalls and a John Deer hat moved towards the door and tried to block my exit. He looked the quintessential redneck.  Another man spat on the floor as he moved to get behind me as the bartender walked around the bar to stand in front of me.  They were slowly surrounding me.

My heart started to race.  I didn't want to have to fight these men, but it looked like I had little choice.  I had to keep telling myself they were just human.  While I was not super strong or super-fast like true Venatori, I had trained my entire life with them.  I could hold my own in a fight against nearly any monster.  But I didn't want to hurt these men.  They were after all doing what they thought was the right thing.

"Look.  I don't want any trouble.  I just need to talk to Naomi.  She's been doing some pretty bad things.  I don't want to hurt her."

The spitting man had been the one who was thought I was a high priced and fancy gay man.  He was now sneering at me over the pouch of tobacco he was still chewing.  

I swallowed my disgust at the habit and the idea of kissing a mouth like that.  I pitied any woman who loved him.

He threatened me, "I think you want to do more than that.  Naomi's a good woman.  Known her my whole life.  Sweet lady."

The bartender hitched the shotgun making that familiar catching sound as he loaded the gun. The man in the John Deer hefted a pool stick I hadn't noticed him pick up.  The other man was unarmed.  They slowly closed in on me as the bartender stood back aiming the double barrels at me.

I let my senses go wide.  The smell of their cologne hit my nostrils; the smell of tobacco nearly overwhelmed me.  A single fear-filled memory threatened to encompass my mind.  I had to stomp it down before fear tried to take hold of my body.  I could pull the gun from my holster, but I only did that if I truly meant to kill someone, and I'd rather not add to the potential body count.

Everything happened in a blur.  The two men rushed at me at the same time.  The pool stick was the first to connect. It hit my arm as I was dropping to the ground in a crouched leg swipe of the man in front of me.  I reached for the gun at my hip and had it out as I stood up.  I pointed it at the man with the shotgun.  "I don't want to hurt you."

The man I'd laid out on the floor was slowly getting up.  The man with the pool stick was glancing down at him.  The bartender started to shake in fear.

I was most worried about him.  If the gun went off, I'd give myself away truly.  The blow to my arm only ached because of the air shield around me.  But stopping the shot at this close range was going to difficult to explain.  "Drop the gun before you do something stupid."

I turned my head to the redneck with the pool stick, "And you might want to drop the stick."

He stammered at me and took a step closer.

I pulled the trigger on the gun and nicked the bartenderâ€™s  ear.  "That's far enough too.  Don't make me hurt you.  Back away from the door and just let me go.  I'm not going to hurt you.  And I'm not going to hurt Naomi unless she tries to kill me too.  I don't take kindly to being attacked.  I will defend myself." 

I waved my gun for the gunman to move and he shuffled to the side with his hand to his ear.  "You hit me."

I grinned at the man, "I did.  Imagine what I could shoot of next."  I adjusted my aim to indicate a general direction.  

The man paled.

My aim moved passed his most prized piece and I grinned at him.  "Maybe a foot?"  I chuckled, "Nah..."  

I didn't have time to adjust my aim again before he sidestepped out of my way completely.  The others kindly remained where they were.  For that, I was thankful.

I never took my eyes off the four men as I made my way to the door.  I had lowered the gun to point at the floor and the men stayed where they were.  I turned only long enough to pry up the spent bullet from the wall and stuffed it in my pocket as I walked out the door.

I heard a scramble inside but no one came after me.  If the human police came I knew how to handle them, it wasn't the first time that I'd had to do it - just the first time on this case.

Now I had lost precious time in following after Naomi and her cohorts.  I was back to square one.  But there was one thing I knew about dragons.  They never roamed far from their hoard.  If the locals knew her, that meant her hoard was close.  I only had to find it.
