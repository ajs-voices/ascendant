# The First Death
_Monday, June 15, 2015 1:00PM_

I was left alone on top of the roof.  It had been a long time since I'd been up here, and even longer since I'd been completely alone.  Once people caught word I was jumping I usually had a pile of people joining me for the spectical of it all or to jump themselves.  

I had missed the scenic view, I could see for miles and miles up here.  I could do that in the mountains, but I was never without my two feet on the ground.  Here it felt different.  I don't know what it was but I realy missed this.  I took a deep breath and closed my eyes and absorbed home.  

I had to make myself walk into the door and down the stairs to the Archives.  I had work to do.  

The Archives were much the same as they had been when I left yesterday, the biggest change was a distinct lack of Mrs. Vega.  I would have liked to see her sparkling green eyes and her bright smile before heading into work.  I knew it was a replacement for what I wanted.  And I was sure Margo would have a field day with that information.

I followed the same path we had taken earlier and I found the room empty, the lights off.  I opened the door and reached inside and fumbled for the light switch that I knew was there.  The lights flickered on with their sickly yellow light illuminating the walls and rows of books and the lone table in the room.  

I shut the door behind me and sat down at the table and browsed the books that were already out.  Sure enough they had been records of the Viddens and Vegas.  I flipped through the most recent volumes.  I wished for Dorian's photographic memory as I tried to remember the dates of the cases that had been the most interesting.

There was a knock at the door and a small girl of about sixteen came in sulking and frowning as she dropped a folder on my table.  "I was told to give these to you."  She sneered and stood there like I was expected to do something.

I smiled brightly at her and she blushed as she scampered off in the direction she'd come.  I sighed, I wished they'd make up their mind as whether or not they hated me or were in love wih the idea of the bad boy I proclaimed myself as.  It was tiring.

I took a look through the new files and saw that it was exactly what I had been looking for.  I wondered if this was Dorian's or his mother's handy work.  But it really didn't matter.  I now had the names of the two families that were exiled by Kai and Emilio.

I got up from the table and walked to the far corner with the names of the familes jotted down on my phone's note app so I didn't forget them.  

It took me a while to find the right records for the families, they were intermingled with other things cases in that year.  And with the records always changing the binders were always growing, or the books were being repirnted with added information when the spines grew too large for the added pages.

Ironically I also found Levi's family in one of the binders that one family was in.  Exiled around the same time.  I glanced through the Hughes files briefly taking note that they'd left voluntarily not exiled.  That could explain a lot.  But that was for later.

I sat down with the two volumes and the records and I really couldn't find anything of note.  These two familes had no Magnus going as far back as I could trace.   I had to even rummage around in tomes so old that I was afraid every page turn was going to rip the pages.

I glanced at the time on my phone and found that it was far later than I'd thought.  I didn't have time to pounder long as I heard the sirens go off.  There was a fire - but it wasn't a fire that required evacuation.  The siren's were different, this was an elemental fire typically a fire starter or an accident.

I listened to the pattern of the siren and knew exactly where it was.  It was in the adult residences, that was odd.  Unless a bomb went off.  I scrambled out of my chair and I headed to the third floor of the adult residences where the alrms said the fire was.  

As I neared I knew exactly where I was going, only the Vegas lived in the direction of the pandamonium I was seeing around me as I jogged towards the location of the alarm.

I rounded the courner and I saw Emilio wrapped around Dorian's tall muscular frame.  It was really an interesting contrast.  Their Spanish decent was apparent between the two of them, but where Dorian was only an inch shorter than I was, Emilio was two or three shorter than Dorian.  He was wider and far less pretty than his son.  But they were kin there was no doubt about it.  

My admiriation soon faded as I took a step inside the room and saw a charred corpse of a woman.  I swallowed hard.  Mrs. Vega...

I turned back to the Vegas outside in the hall just as Sahara joined Dorian and their father.  She was wearing nothing but a sports bra and gym shorts, and she looked winded like she'd just run up the stairs from where ever she had been.

She gave me a frown and put her hand on her father's shoulder and his tears fell even harder and faster and my heart lept for him.  I wished I could do something.  Mr. Vega wrapped his arms around Sahara and she comforted him.  It was awkward watching the family dynamic.  Dorian looked at me and I gave him a sad smile.  I wanted to go to him to let him cry, but I had to see more.  I nodded to Dorian to indicate I was going in, he nodded knowingly as he put his hand on his father's shoulder and turned his attention back to the family.

I walked inside and Kai was standing there yelling at the fire squad.  "I don't care just get out."

I had no idea what he was yelling about and I tried to ignore him.  I looked at the blast radius and the disarray of the perfect house.  It had been perfect, now a charred blast circle and the corpse of a woman I'd spoke to only a few hours ago lay on the carpet.  I fought the bile and tears that threatened to reveal my emotions.  This was going to stay with me a while.

"Another package?"  I asked to no one imparticular.

Kai didn't look at me he only nodded.  He was trying not to get angry at me, I could tell by the way he clenched his jaw and the fire and earth moved around him.  He looked at me with questions in his eyes, I smiled and cocked my head waiting for him to ask.  It took him a while to find the right words, maybe he was trying not to yell I don't know.  I didn't know the man well enough.  "Any residual affects?  Something someone else might miss?"

I shook my head, "I don't think so.  The patterns are still here, dissipating quickly without their cohesion they are slipping back into their natural states.  If someone were more adept at forensics they might be able to peice it together.  I've never tried to."

Kia nodded, "Can you try?"

I shrugged.  "Yeah I guess."  I started pulling the scattered patterns to me and finding the missing peices.  I sat there for an indeterminate amount of time as my father watched me.  I wondered what was going through his head.  

I shook my head, "No, they are going too fast, I put one together and another dissipates.  I'm not fast enough."  

Dorian from the doorway asked with sadness in his voice, "You think it's a limit of yours?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I don't think it's a physical reaction time.  We'd need to slow the decay rate.  I don't know how to do that."

Kai nodded, "At least you tried."  

He looked at me and headed out the door with a slight nod.  It was better than I had expected from him.   I turned and noticed that it had grown dark.  What time was it?

Dorian looked at me, I could see the saddness in his eyes.  I closed the distance between us and whispred to him, "I'm so sorry."  He gave me a weak smile.  I put my hand on his arm and he relaxed under my touch.  I could wrap him in a hug, and be the rock he needed like he'd been so many times for me, but that was not Dorian.  Dorian was strong in the face of anything.  There were no tears, just glassy eyes rimmed in red.  He looked sad but he had not let loose yet.  He did not break down.  

I remembered the day my mother had died.  It wasn't in the cave that she'd been attacked in, no it was an Infirmary much like the one Nick was in right now.  Except there was nothing they could do now.  Even Venatori are not immune to the venom of a were creature, but she was just human.  While they don't turn on the full moon, it is one of few venoms that override the antibodies that allow them to heal quickly, it's not quick enough.  It was almost like lycanthropy (and vampirism for that matter) were designed just to kill Venatori. 

I remembered watching my mother writhe in agony from the window outside her room.  She didn't want anything to do with me.  I could hear her blaming me for the pain when the nurses left the room.  My heart sank each time.  That was my mother, and that was how she felt about me.  She died from the transition from human to werebear.  She survived the birthing of a half Venatori child but couldn't survive the change.  Ironic.

I had to push the thoughts from my head.  I whispered to Dorian, "I don't think these are coming from the mail room.  I think there's an inside man.  Nick mentioned a kid gave him the package."

I took Dorian's hand and pulled him away from the crowd and into the hall around the corner.  It wasn't that I cared if someone overherad but I knew Dorian would.  "If you need anything, for you or your family.  Let me know."

Dorian nodded, my heart went out to him.  He'd just lost his mother and he was trying to put on a good face. "You already are doing more than necessary.  I don't think ..."  Dorian hesitated a moment.  "still up for discussing patterns later?"

I was shocked to think he still wanted to do that.  But that he felt I was better company than his own head, maybe there was hope.  I nodded, "Sure thing, anything you need.  I'm going to hit the mail room and give the orders myself.  And scan what I can while it's there.  I'll see you later."

Dorian nodded, "Later it is then."

I patted Dorian's arm as I walked past him, I wanted to hold him, tell him it would get easier, but I didn't want to step past my bounds.  I walked away from Dorian and Emilio stepped in pace with me and nodded, "Come with me."

I blinked at him and nodded.  I wasn't sure what was going on.  We walked out of his home in silence.  I walked with Mr. Vega down cooridor after cooridor and waited for some indication of what was going on.  The silence was unbearable, "I'm sorry for your loss."

Emilio stopped and turned to look at me.  I couldn't tell what he was feeling or thinking.  He looked so much like Dorian yet, he was harder, the fine lines of Dorian's face were not present but he was his father's son.  I watched as emotions played across his face, the man before me was always so strong, he was at a loss right now.  The man stared at me, seeing through me, and I felt like squirming under the scruty.  He eventually nodded, coming to terms with whatever had plagued his mind as I said my condolances, "Thank you."

Strangly Emilio put his hand around my shoulder and he pulled me back towards the direction we'd been going.  We walked in silence a few more steps before Emilio added, "Your father..."

I didn't want to hear the next phrases but I didn't say anything.  "Your father is calling an all hands meeting.  He asked me to bring you with me.  To scavenge through the video footage.  I found it ironic that he'd ask you considering his venomous outrage at your being here in the first place."  He patted my shoulder, "You've grown on him I think.

I laughed, "I don't know about that.  He thinks it's an inside man too?"

Emilio laughed, "I would say the two of you were two peas in a pod but if Kai heard me I'm sure he'd disavow any friendship we ever had."

I grinned.  "Nick said a kid handed him the package.  The one on Kai's counter wasn't delivered by the mailroom.  We could check that footage, and the hand off of Nick's, and back track to see when Mrs. Vega got hers."

Emilio nodded, "Smart boy.  That's what we are going to do.  We have a lot of footage to sweep.  Though seeing Nicholas was probably not very smart.  There are certain things that Kai blames you for."

I nodded, "Nick and I discussed the biggest issue.  Nick was gay before I met him."

Emilio nodded, "I know that, and Nick knows this, but it's highly ironic that both of our youngest boys are ..."

I grinned, "Gay?  And Kai has me to offset things even worse."

Emilio nodded, "Yes, he is not happy you and Nick got caught."

I laughed, "Imagine if we hadn't."

Emilio paled.  "I didn't think of it that way, and I honestly don't think Kai has either.  If Dae'lin hadn't caught you things could have been worse off."

I grinned at the best friend of my father, "Oh it would have been a grand night.  Worse thinking about it but damn it woulda been fun."

Emilio actually blushed.  I chuckled to myself mostly as Emilio shook his head, "You really do like to abuse that knowledge don't you?  That's what Kai hates you know.  You are everything he is and was and no one likes you for it."

I smiled, "That has nothing to do with being Kai's son.  I push people away.  It's what I do."

Emilio nodded knowingly, "Not everyone."

It was my turn to blush.  Emilio waved it off.  "My boy will find his own way.  These new regulations are playing havoc on his soul.  He needs someone."

I grinned, "Well... "

Emilio paused in front of a door and opened it.  In side was a darkly light room with a ton of monitors, Security room # X. I didn't know the actually number but they all had numbers.

The guard looked up and nodded.  There was no exchange of words he already knew he needed to step out - two hunters meant business.  It was interesting seeing the default line of heirarchy play out in the NYC compound.  I had missed the way it worked together unlike the one in Boulder.

Emilio sat down and I took the other chair, I asked, "Do you want to start in front of the apartment, or at her work?"

Emilio waved me off, "You start at the apartment I'll watch her at work."

I nodded and started looking for the cameras in front of the Vega's apartment.  This was going to be a long night.
