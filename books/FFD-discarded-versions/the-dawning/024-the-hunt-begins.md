# The Hunt Begins
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 12:40PM_

It was difficult to say where Levi might go.  I really didn't have a clue.  A cold draft reminded me my shirt was now with Dorian and I didn't have a hoodie with me.  I could walk around only so long before even I got tired of the looks I'd received.  The epic bruise was still yellow and green from yesterday.  And the rather large scar running across my chest always received weird glances.  I was proud of my scars, I survived!  That's what they meant to me, but to others they were a reminder of what I was.  It didn't matter if all venatori hunters had scars, I was half human.  I reminded them they weren't all they were cracked up to be.  I sighed at my own inner thoughts and pushed them away.

There were too many directions to check.  My plan while good in theory was not going to work.  I needed a starting point.  I needed to go to the cameras too.  But first I should probably get a shirt.  

I started for my room.  My clothes were still lying on the floor and bed in a heap.  I still hadn't gotten around to cleaning anything but the towels up after the trashing they'd received.  But that was a problem for another time.

I unlocked my door and found a clean shirt.  It was probably the only branded shirt I owned.  Someone had given it to me with the comment that said something like So you have a clean shirt to wear.  In other words it was not offensive.  But I liked the color, it said indigo when you looked it up online, but it was blue to me.  It would work.

I pulled it over my head and tried to remember what room Emilio used the last time and hoped that he was there.  Thankfully I remembered how to get there.  I still didn't bother with remembering the room number once I'd found it.  I had been correct Emilio was there scanning through an area I didn't recognize.  Emilio jumped when I opened the door.  He had a gun pointed at me before I could even say anything.  I put my hands up out of instinct.  Emilio shook his head, "Don't do that to me."

"Sorry."  I sat down in the other chair in front of the screens.  "Any luck?"

Emilio shook his head.  "Not yet.  I can't bring myself to watch Dorian's attack."

I nodded.  "Alright.  I'll do it."

Emilio put his hand on my shoulder, "We can get someone else to do it."

I shook my head, "Nah that's okay.  I want to do this."

Emilio frowned but let me be.  He went back to his own work.  I had learned a thing or two from the last time I'd done this.  It was much easier to navigate through the cameras this go around.  I hoped I didn't have to do this too often.

I easily found the camera, there was someone there cleaning up the blood stains.  I had to give it to the venatori they were quick on clean up.  Stupid humor filled my mind, 'clean up aisle 6'.  I shook my head at myself.  I had to focus, but I knew I was procrastinating.  I didn't really want to watch what happened to Dorian.  

I heard the alarms.  Finally some idiot finally got off their ass and initiated lock down.  Emilio looked up and nodded, "Bout damn time.  That took forever."

Lock down was meant to happen quickly if you could talk the right person into the idea that lock down was necessary.  Two stabbings didn't seem to pull as much weight as it should have.  If it hadn't been Vega and Viddens I was beginning to wonder if it would have happened at all.  How many innocents would have to die before the council would get off their ass.  The Imperordo was worse than the US government at times - red tape sucked!

Emilio got up, "Bahtroom break."  I nodded in acceptance.  Necessity was necessity no matter the situation.  It would give me time to get past Dorian's attack without worrying about Emilio seeing his son being gutted.  I swallowed back the bile that rose in my throat.  I wasn't looking forward to it either, but I did my job and I started the feed backwards.

It was interesting watching things in reverese, but watching myself was something else.  At least I wasn't listening to the feeds.  Though that likely could help in the future.  I wondered if we recorded sound?  I would have to ask later.

I watched everything happen in reverse.  I saw the paramedics come in with Dorian on the stretcher.  Lay him back down.  I watched myself being pulled back to him and kneeling down.  I speed it up slightly I didn't want to watch what I'd done in reverse but really the camera couldn't see anything.  I saw the blood pool lessen and return to Droain's body.  I wished whole heartedly that I could do this for real, reverse the course of time and never let Dorian out of my sight.

I watched as Dorian was alone afterwards.  He was in pain, gasping for air, and then he got better and better with each breath.  He stood up awkwardly and I saw Levi step into the screen.  I watched in reverse everything that happened.  I watched as Dorian took his phone and dialed my number from memory.  Damn his photographic memory.  But Levi was yelling at him and Dorian was ignoring him it looked.  I wished for audio at that moment, I sucked at reading lips and in reverse it was even worse.  I saw the initial confrontation and I started the feed forward.  I watched everything again at normal speed in the correct order.  

It looked like Levi was telling Dorian to call me.  This was a trap.  I was a target.  I looked over to tell Emilio but he still hadn't returned.  I shrugged, biological functions took a while sometimes.  I went back to my work.  I watched as Levi looked directly at the camera with a smile I could only call as evil.  He was taunting me.  He put his hand on the wall and left a bloody hand print.  How had I not noticed that before?  I was going to have to pay better attention.  But Emilio hadn't either.  

I started fast forwarding and folloiwng on different cameras.  I hadn't realized it but time on the machine had finally caught up to real life.  I knew where Levi was right now but I had no one to watch the monitors to tell me where to go afterwards.  He was going to move, he was moving now.  Where was Emilio?

As if his name in my thoughts summoned him, Emilio stumbled out of a room holding his hands to his sides.  I saw blood blooming along his body.  Stupid, stupid man!

I needed help.   I called Dae'lin, but she didn't answer her phone.  Fuck!  So I called Gary.  I had to look up his number in my phone it wasn't exactly one I called frequently.

"Kenyon here."

"Gary, I need someone in Security Room #310."  Wow, I actually remembered the number on the door.  "Emilio's down.  I have his 20.  But I need people to track at least two suspects.  The more the merrier."

"Nox?  Yeah, alright.  I'll send someone up.  But you should be with your father."

"Fuck that.  Emilio needs help I'm going to him.  The feeds are currently centered on the door I know they are in right this moment.  You'll need to track them from there."

"Nox, your father."

I sighed, "My father is in surgury, when he gets out I'll happily go see how he's doing when he wakes up or this is over.  Until that time I'm doing my job."

Gary sighed, "You are too like your father."

"Thank you.  Send someones here now."  I hung up I didn't wait for an answer as I got the location of the camera and sprinted towards the doors.  I dialed the internal emergency number.  If they could beat me all the better.  

"What's your emergency?"

"Emilio Vega has been injured, stabbed I assume.  36th floor, camera hub 3.  I'm enroute, but if you get their first be careful, assailants still might be there."  I moved quickly through the building.  I wasn't hampered by security, it made me wonder who was on my side up there watching me.  Someone had to be watching.

"Can I get your name?"  The woman on the other side asked after she'd relayed the message to someone in the room.

"Nox SÃ©tanta."  I clipped as I rode the elevator.  I could feel my own inner panic rising, but I pushed it down, there were other things to worry about right now - like Emilio Vega dying like my father, or Dorian.  I couldn't let that happen on my watch.

"Alright Nox, we have dispatched a medical crew they have an eta of 3 minutes.  What's your eta?"

"With the help of whoever is up watching my progress I should be there as soon as the elevator drops me on the floor.  It's not too far away I think."  I hoped.

"Stay on the line with us."  I nodded but knew they couldn't see it.

"Alright.  I'm putting my phone in my pocket though I need my hands."  I wished for my gun right then.  Why hadn't I taken it with me?  Because I wasn't intending to hunt right now, I was in research mode.  I hated research mode, but it was preferential to this particular situation right now.  I should have grabbed it when I went to get a clean shirt.  Stupid, preoccupied mind!

I heard an alright from the other side of the phone as slipped it into my back pocket.  The elevator stopped and I moved to the side so that I wasn't in direct line of fire.  Thankfully bullets didn't fly or any patterns either, I was in the clear for the moment as I tried to remember to breathe.  But it felt wonderful to feel the thrill of the hunt.  I truly did live for this.
