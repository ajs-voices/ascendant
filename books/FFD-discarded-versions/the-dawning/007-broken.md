# Broken
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 around 5pm_

I rounded the corner with too many thoughts in my head.  Each one vying for top billing.  There was the mission at hand that was running through my head, how could one of our own target Venatori.  It was unheard of.  Venatori went rogue sure, but usually not against other Venatori.  And then there was Stella and the confusing signals she was sending - dinner and a kiss yet but not a date.  Maybe that was the reason I was eyeing everyone I'd had been close to growing up.  Was it the vast expanse of emptiness that triggered this?  I was really going to need to talk to Margo now.

I wasn't paying attention when I ran into a large frame that barely moved.  The voice that spouted, "What the fuck!  Watch where you are going!", registered just as the man recognized who I was.  I was looking into the dark pools of chocolate that were my father's eyes.  

With a quick and effortless motion I was pinned against the wall.  My heart jumped into my throat and I could feel the panic set in as my body relaxed out of reflex.  My father weilded his magic like an ogre, his speed and strength were his best weapons and he was using them against me with ease.  But I could see the anger in the patterns around him.  I could hardly breathe between the panic in my body and the pressure of his fist against my chest.

I croaked out "Kai".  

He spoke in a quiet voice, it was eirie and frightening, "I don't need your help son.  Go back where you came from.  I told Dae'lin I didn't need you snopping around here."

He continued to hold me against the wall and yet my panic didn't settle into compliance, his angry made me on edge.  I could barely breath, I focused air around my father and flung him across the hall to the other side of the wall.  I fell forward and I smiled at my father, I'm sure it was less than friendly, I could feel the years of bullshit I had endured here building up, I needed to leave before I took it out on the man who gave me life.

I walked away from my father and headed towards my temporary home.  When I got far enough away I released my father and prayed he didn't try to follow me.  I leaned against the wall and tried to catch my breath and let the feeling return to my hands, I hadn't realized were balled in a fist.  I hate this feeling.  I hated it with a passion.  I needed to let it go...

I need to break things.  Really break things, but that wasn't good for me either.  Margo suggests I workout, or to go for a run, so that's what I would do, but I'd do it my way - and break things.  I started towards my room as my phone rang.  I stopped and grabbed it from my pocket it was an unknown number.  I answered, "Yeah?"

A sweet voice swept over the line, "Hey Nox.  You figure out your plans?"

I sighed, I wasn't in the mood and I wasn't sure I would be good company.  "Hey Stella.  I can try to make it over in a few hours."  I said I'd go, so I'll try to make it.  "I will call if I can't make it."

Stella laughed, "Fine be like that.  Go hang with Jason and leave me."

I grinned, "Jace went home to his wife.  I have something I need to do and then I'll be over.  But I sometimes lose track of time."

Stella smiled, "Sure, sure.  I'll see you in a few hours.  I have to go Aiden is crawling up the fridge."

"Alright, I'll see you then."  I hung up the phone feeling a little better.  But not great.  I unlocked the door to my room and walked in.  

The room was bland.  Even blander than my room in the dorms.  It was beige in every direction.  The carpet, the walls. The celing was the only thing that was white.  It was small but it was quaint.  

There was a full size bed off to the side, a table and two chairs in the middle of the room, a small kitchenette to the left, a door that had to be the bathroom to the right.  A small couch, and a TV hung on the far wall.  It was cozy.  But it was mine for now.  It would do, I would likey be on my way again after Mark found I was in town.

I saw my bags sitting on the bed where Jace left them, a note sat on top of my laptop bag.  "Hey babe, Glad you are back.  Will stop by for breakfast - Jace"

Jace was still calling me endearments, which meant that people still made comments about it.  The rumors the last few years had us sleeping together and much worse.  None of it was true, at least not completely true, we hadn't actually slept together in the sexual sense, we'd shared beds for sleep and with other women or men between us.  But we personally never actually did more than share a touch or a kiss here and there.  

Our friendship was important to us both and we didn't want to ruin it with sex.  Neither of us at the time were looking for that perfect someone.  Jace had of course already found her, he and Mia had been on again, off again for years.

I grabbed my laptop and the files Dorian gave me and started wandering the halls of the compound looking for the right place.  I headed back towards the classrooms and found one of the fire starter training rooms.  I stopped in front of the orange door and my heart speed up.  Behind one of those doors my nightmares started.

I watched helplessly as the memories came back while I was awake.  Each movement I made mimic ones I'd dreamt about every day for most of life.  I opened the door, I felt like the five year old I had been.  So naive and unafraid.  I could see Master Garrett standing in the middle of the room waiting for me.  He looked kind.  He could be trusted I was told.  Everyone said he would help me control the fire.  

I shut the door behind me.  He'd smile at me.  The first day he tried to make me spark, tried to get me to start a fire uncontrolled.  He tried everything.  He tickeled me.  I squirmed at his touch.  I didn't spark.  He tried to make me sad, and he made me angry, and then without any warning, his hand flew across the front of his body and the back of his hand made contact with my cheek.  I could feel the bruise blooming.  I sparked, and I cried.  I was lost in my tears as he comforted me and that was the end of that session.

The next day I came back and he smiled again.  He told me what was to follow was for my own good - to teach me.  He took no pleasure in it.  He weilded air, I could see the flailing pattern around him as he told me to take off my shirt.  I didn't obey, I was afraid.  I felt the fear course through me like it was that day.  He pushed me up against the wall and hit me with his fist, "Listen boy, Do as I say or this will go badly."  

He was no longer kind.  I remembered thinking what had I done to make him so mad.  I scrambled out of my shirt and listened flawlessly the remainder of the session as he brought the strings of air across my back.  He muffled my cries when I started sobbing.  

Every day since then ran through my mind.  The strength and change in his demeanor, my willingness to give up the moment I walked in the door.  The fear...

A hand touched my shoulder and I jumped, a pained cry escaped my lips before I regained control of my body and pushed the fears away.  I looked in the direction I had been touched and I saw peace.  It wasn't my hormones speaking this time, I could smell the safety of home on Dorian.  I could see the calm concern in his blue eyes.  He'd moved away from me the moment I cried out but he stayed and watched me.

I turned my back on him as I wiped away the tears that fell on to my cheeks.  I wove a ball of air and fire into a perfect pattern and hurled it across the room and watched the pattern scatter into a billion bits and peices as the ball shattered on the wall.

I threw another and another until the tears stopped falling.  I could feel Dorian's eyes on me.  I chocked out through fireballs, "Can I help you?"

Dorian didn't say anything as I heard him pull a chair over and sit down to my left, not too close, but close enough he didn't have to shout to respond to me.  "I saw you standing outside, you looked lost."

I took a deep breath and gathered my strength, "I'm not lost.  Just haunting memories."

"I can tell.  Do you want to talk about it?"  The concern in his voice, the patience I grew up with reverberated in everything he said to me.  My heart fell as the fear tried to take over.

I shook my head, "If I talk about it, it'll get worse."

"Whatever it is does Dr. Silverman know?"  Dorian asked.  I shook my head.  "You need to talk to someone, it's clearly upsetting you."

I shook my head again.  "I came here because of my father."

Dorian chuckled softly, "I saw that as well.  I swear I'm not following you."  His voice went back to the calm demeanor that meant I was safe.  "Your father upsets you?  This upsets you?  I see now why your standing appointment remains."

I turned to Dorian, I couldn't imagine the sight I was, my eyes were probably puffy and red, tear stains streaking my cheeks.  I was holding a fireball above my hand, the orange glow dancing in both of our eyes.  I gave Dorian a fake smile, "Are you still watching over me?"

Dorian smiled reassuring, it was soft and it did the job.  I could feel the childhood safety of his office.  Everything I said there was between us - and his records.  He recorded everything.  "You are cesari." He said.

That one statement alone made my heart sink.  He followed me because I was his niche - nothing more.  I frowned and turned around and threw a few more fireballs.  As I formed another I heard Dorian stand up, I saw him out of the corner of my eye as he stood next to me.  "I care what happens to you, Nox.  As every other child here.  I continue to keep tabs on you because you are cesari.  It does not change the fact that I care."

I threw the fireball and wove another pattern.  Dorian continued, "I will tell you what I think this is then.  I think the orange door reminded you of what Garrett did to you behind the veil here."

My world crashed around me. My breathing stopped, my heart speed up if that were even possible, it had already been cantering at high speed with the fear that coursed through my body.  The fireball I'd been creating fizzled in my hand.

Dorian put his hand on my shoulder, "Breathe, Nox."  

As if it were a command I took a gasping breath and fell to my knees.  "What do you know?" I whispered, I could barely hear it but it sounded like thunder in my ears.

Dorian sat down on the concrete floor to my left, just out of reach, he was being careful, but he was concerned, I could see the patterns shifting around him, this was upsetting him as much as it was me.  He put his hands on his knees, "I don't KNOW anything.  I suspect a great many things.  Garrett did something to you, and you set him on fire.  That is all I know.  But I know you wouldn't do that without provoking, it was no accident I know that much."

I felt five again.  My body hurt, I could feel the lashes across my back, I wanted to curl up into a little ball and die.  It had been a very long time since I'd felt like this.  I fell backwards to sit on the cold concrete instead of kneel.  I pulled my knees up to my chest and hung my head against them.  I could feel the fear and the pain again.  I'd moved past this.  It was a waking nightmare.  I hadn't had one in years.  I whispered, "He beat me."

I heard a hitch in Dorian's breath that indicated that was what he suspected.  He didn't react like I expected, he didn't move to hug me, try to comfort me, he didn't take pity on the grown man curled up in the fetus position crying.  He spoke calmly and softly and I could feel the tension leaving my body, "I moved you from his tutelage because I suspected.  I've watched him since.  I cannot pin anything on him.  All recordings of you were veiled."

I sat there listening to my breathing, and to Dorian's.  We sat there for a good while, thankfully I'd stopped crying.  I straigthened my back and I put on a grin.  "Was there something I could help you with?"

Dorian's smile was strained, he was putting on a good face as he shook his head.  "I had just come from seeing a new student's test when I saw you standing in front of this room.  You looked lost."

My lip curled in a half smile, "You said that already."  I stood up and took a deep breath.  "I'd rather anyone else not know."

Dorian nodded, "I will tell no one, you know this."  Dorian reached a hand to my arm and smiled at me, "You had a date, yes?"

I laughed, it felt hollow but it was there, I could feel it bubbling inside, knew it was good to move on, move past the depression that always followed the waking nightmare.  "She said it's not a date.  Though I doubt I'll be good company."

Dorian took a cautious step closer and put his other hand on my arm, "Go.  Forget about here.  Forget about what happened, be young.  I will make sure Dae'lin gives you some time.  I can't promise much, but I can promise some."

I shook my head, "You don't have to."

Dorian grinned, "Yes I do.  Go, Nox.  Free these memories. Speak with Margo tomorrow, tell her about it.  Please?  I think it'll help."  Dorian grabbed my things, he smiled as he noticed the papers were his.  "I will take these to your room.  You go.  I'm sure being early won't be bad."

I nodded and Dorian waited for me to walk out the door.  I grinned at him and brushed my lips against his cheek and whispered, "Thank you."  He smelled like he always did, of cinamon and vanilla.  I could get lost in that scent.  I wanted to.  The happy thoughts carried me out the door of the fire starter training room.
