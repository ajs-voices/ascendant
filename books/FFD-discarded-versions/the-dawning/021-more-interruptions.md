# More Interruptions
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 10:30AM_

The work out had been good for my soul, it always was.  I would likely have a few more bruises to show off later.  At least they'd be gone soon enough.  I reached in my pocket for my key and another voice interrupted my thoughts, it seemed the day for that.  "You seem awful happy with yourself."

I smiled at the short raven haired woman behind me.  "Been a good morning for a change."  

Dae'lin ran her finger down the length of my jaw, "As opposed to?"

I grinned, "That was mutually beneficial fight."  I turned and unlcoked my door with the key from my pocket.  I was surprised it didn't find itself in the crevices of Dorian's cushions.  The images brought very naughty things to mind and I had to push the thoughts away.

I opened my door and walked inside, Dae'lin followed and closed the door behind her.  "I had a good morning not much you can say that will change that."

She sighed, "I bet I can.  You and I never had a chance to talk yesterday.  You have time now?"

I sighed.  "I need a shower, but yeah I guess we can talk."

I sat down on the bed and Dae'lin pulled a chair in front of me. She crossed her legs to draw attention to them.  And it did, I followed what appeared to be long silky legs up her body and noticed that Dae'lin was dressed to kill.  The light blue dress she wore fit her curves in ways I couldn't have possibly imagined based on her normal dress.  She was trying to impress me.  

I laughed, "You try too hard."

She leaned forward not realizing what she ws doing, her cleevage revealed far more than she anticipated.  "I do what?"  She seethed at me.

I grinned and removed myself from the temptation that she was throwing in my face.  "You try too hard."  I walked over to the fridge and grabbed two bottles of water then a glass I filled with ice from the freezer.  "I'd notice you even if you didn't dress like that."

I poured one of the bottles into the glass and brought it to Dae'lin.  I drapped my arm over her shoulder and handed her the glass from behind as I leaned over to whisper in her ear. "You don't need to impress me Dae'lin."  I could see the color rising in her ear and smiled, "I'm not oblivous to your charms despite my feelings about this whole thing."  I brushed my lips against her neck and moved around to sit back on my bed away from her.  

She sighed, "You...."  She looked flustered, her normally tanned skin was rosy red from the rush of hormones I'd insighted in her.  It was good to know she wasn't oblivious to me if we were going to have any chance of making a child together.

I smiled softly, "I'm what?  Attracted to you?  Have certain tastes?  You think you need to grab my attention to win?  Would there even be anyone else in the running Dae'lin?  You are the only match the council will allow me to join in this particular union with."

I sighed, "They want Cesari and you are the only possible solution to that dilemia right now."

Dae'lin sighed, "It doesn't have to be like that.  There can be more."

I laughed, "You don't want more.  You want to do your duty and that's it.  You can override my limitations.  It's Genetics over love. I'm right aren't I?"

Dae'lin looked down.  I had nailed it.  She was embarrassed.  When she looked up I could see that she was far more rosy colored than before.  "Is that why you chose to be with men?  To sleep with who you want?  To fuel you limitations?"

I laughed, "Dae'lin I sleep with men because I enjoy it.  I am honest to god attracted to men.  I like women.  I find their bodies appealing in a way a man's is not.  I am not shy about my proclivaties because I want people to not like me.  I'm aware of my own limitations and my problems.  I like men Dae'lin  there is nothing you or anyone is going to be able to say or do that will change that."

Dae'lin laughed, "I knew you flaunted your sexuality on prupose.  But why just not be gay."

I laughed, "I like women, Duckling. It's not an either or for me.  I do like both."

Dae'lin sighed, "But..."

"But what Dae'lin?"

The woman blushed yet again she was going to remain beat red if she didn't stop it, "I saw you leave Dorian's room this morning."

"Did you now?  Who did you tell?"

She looked at me with confusion.  "No one.  Why?"

I shook my head, "No reason.  Dorian didn't want to be alone.  We went to dinner, talked patterns, watched a movie where I proceeded to fall asleep on his couch.  I made him breakfast and then I left."

"Rumors run around here like wildfire.  They said you looked cozy with him."

I smiled, "And what business is it of your's who I get cozy with?  You want my genetics, I am not going to get Dorian pregnant unless there is something I truly do not know about sex."

Dae'lin paled.  "You don't even deny it?"

"Deny what?  That I like Dorian.  That I want to sleep with him? What point would there be in that, Dae'lin?  I like men.  I _like_ Dorian.  It'll get around even if I deny it."

"But..."  

I stood up and walked around behind her again and whispered in her ear, "Do you want the deep down and dirty details, Dae'lin?  Do you want to know how we had sex all night long?" Dae'lin paled as I continued.  "Dorian has no fucking bearing on anything you and I do.  If he and I choose to do anything it's none of your damned business."

I backed away  "What are the terms?"  It sat back down on the bed and waited for Dae'lin go speak.

She sighed and steadied herself against the chair.  "My line, then your's provided they pass as Venatori, with your limitations being the only acceptable outcome."

"And if the children fail to have enhance senses and healing at minimum?"

Dae'lin sighed, "Death."

I shook my head, "No fucking way."

"They do not want to weaken the lines any farther, Nox."  She pleaded with me.  "I don't think they will negotiate that."

"Fine on the weakening the lines, I understand that, but there is no fucking way I'm going to agree to have my child killed because he doesn't meet some stupid rule.  Steralize him, remove him from the breeding programs, but death, if that is the only way, then they can go to fucking hell Dae'lin.  I will not do it.  I can't beleive you would let them do that to your child."

"It is my duty."

"Fuck duty."  I started pacing.  There was no way I was killing any of my offspring.  I watched the patterns shift in my room.

Dae'lin quickly moved her chair and rushed to my side.  She put her hand on my arm, "Calm down."

I looked at Dae'lin, "Calm down?  I'm not you."  I ws so pissed right now at her that she thought I couldn't control myself like she did.  "I'm not going to start a damn fire because I'm pissed off.  That shit was beat out of me as a child.  You may think it was all flowers and candy in my training.  But it wasn't."

Dae'li looked at me like I was lying.  "No one beat you as a child, Nox."

I yanked my arm free of her grip, "The fuck they didn't."

"Someone would have told me if other kids were getting abused."

I smirked, "Who said they told anyone?  I sure as hell didn't.  But I made sure he wouldn't do it again when I got control of my abilities.  Got another fucking year of fire starter training for that 'accident'".  I put air quotes around the world accident.

Dae'lin sound incredulous, "Nox!"

"What?  He fucking beat me every day for more than a year. I was half human female born minorem, no one would care about me if I died.  He beat me because I sparked when I was afraid.  The first time he was understanding, the remainder of them he beat me to make me stop sparking.  You know the only good thing about my abilities, the healing allowed him to beat me and hide the fact that he had been."

"So you what, lit him on fire.  I remember your last accident.  Your instructor..."  Dae'lin didn't finish the sentence as she covered her mouth in realization.  She reached out and touched my hand, "I didn't know."

I pulled away from Dae'lin and flopped down on the bed, "No one knew, Dae'lin and I'd appreciate it stay that way."

Dae'lin sat on the edge of the bed, I stared up at the ceiling, "If we have a fire-starter they won't go through that Dae'lin. I'll train the kid myself."

Dae'lin put her hand on my knee, "I understand.  I will speak to them about unqualified children.  They will relent."

I nodded, "What else do we have to go over?"

"We can talk about this later, Nox."

I sat up.  "No.  We'll finish it now I don't want to rehash this conversation later."

Dae'lin sighed, "I don't want to be a mother."

"You what?"  Nox raised an eyebrow.  "You expect me to do this?"
 
Dae'lin got up and started pacing, "The Venatori can raise my children, I don't want my mother's life."

I sighed, "No, Dae'lin they won't.  Your bloodline should be raised by you.  But if you refuse then I will."

Dae'lin sighed turned on her heel and stared at me like I was an alien, "You'd give up hunting to raise a child?  You would stay here?"

"I would stay here even if you wanted to raise the child yourself.  I will not be my father, and I will not be my mother."  I nearly spat at the thought of leaving a child to the will of the Venatori.

Dae'lin started walking for the door.  "Nox.  How is it that we see things so differently.  I thought...."  She opened the door and I shifted the patters to keep it closed.  She stared at me with heat rising in her eyes.  "Let me go, Nox."

I walked over to her and put my hand against the door above her head and whsiered in her ear.  I could smell the rose petals of her perfume. "You thought you'd raised me differently.  You thought because I had no parents, that I'd be okay with letting my children live the life I had."

Dae'lin looked up at me with pleading eyes and I shook my head.  My voice was quiet and distanct, I could feel the pain and the fear just below the surface.  I couldn't let another child have my life, ever.  "I will raise our children without the help of the so-called Venatori community.  I will be both father and mother if I have to be.  I will give you your blood line.  I will insure the survivablity of he Venatori race.  I will accept that my children may never have children.  But if they think for one minute that I will let my children die, or be raised by the Venatori without my guidance I will become Exuli.  I will remove my gift from the bloodline of the Venatori all together.  They will accept or they will not have my genes for thier use."

Dae'lin let out a gasp.  I could see fear and sadness in her eyes.  She nodded as she reached for the door knob.  "I will relay the message.   You are too important to lose, they will accept."

I removed myself and the patterns that barred her escape from me.  I saw pity in her eyes.  "For whatever it's worth, I'm sorry."

I shook my head, "Forget it.  You have my terms."

I wanted to bite bullets, everything that had calmed me before was gone.  A good nights rest, an understanding with my father, a decent work out - all of it gone and there was nothing but memories to calm my anger.  And I couldn't even relive the memories because they hurt just as much.  The wanting of Dorian, the need to jump with him, the feel of his body against mine.  I wanted him but...he didn't want me.  I sighed and pushed the thoughts away and focused back on Dae'lin.

"And Dae'lin, don't try so hard next time.  You are so just fine the way you are, even after a work out I'm sure."  I grined playfully, "And there is much less clothes to take off then too."

She yelled, "Nox."  She hit me on the arm as I smiled lewedly at her, "You are the worst ever.  I don't know how you talk so many girls to your bed."

I grinned, "I didn't have to talk too hard to get you in my bed."  She hit me again and I laughed, "Well I didn't."

Dae'lin sighed and lifted on her tip toes and kissed my cheek.  "I suppose you are right." She grinned mischeviously at me, "How hard did you talk to get into Dorian's bed?"

I winked at her, "I don't kiss and tell."  I couldn't exactly tell her nothing had happened, it would through my reputation out the door.  But the rumor would kill Dorian's.  It was a no win situation.

Dae'lin giggled, "So you did kiss him.  Should I be jealous"

I frowned, "We didn't kiss but yes you should be jealous." I wanted Dorian, I didn't want her.  I smiled to lighten the mood.  "Let me know how it goes."  

Dae'lin nodded, "I'm truly sorry Nox."

I nodded, "Don't worry about it."

I watched as Dae'lin left.  I knew why she didn't want to be a mother, but it had nothing to do with her way of life, it had to do with her petition for marriage.  She wanted to get married to a minorem and he was steralized so no kids.  She didn't want to flaunt it in his face.  I was okay with that.  

I wanted to know what Dorian thought about the situation.  I almost called him.  I wanted to hear his voice, I needed to.  I should call him.

I heard Dae'lin call out after me, "You aren't supposed to be checking me out Nox.  I hope to be married soon."

I nodded and grinned, "Like that has ever stopped me, Duckling."

I walked into the bathroom and started the shower just as a knock sounded at his door.  "Oy."

I turned off the water and walked out to the front door.  I was never going to get a shower.  I opened the door and Levi pushed his way inside, "Can I show you something?"

"Be my guest."  I was glad he'd come to me, and more importantly I was glad he was practicing.  

He looked around and laughed, "This is a boring room.  So not what I expected."

I laughed too, "It is and it's only temporary."

Levi nodded and sat down on the edge of my bed.  He put his hands in front of him, "I've been practicing.  I know I'm not supposed to but..."

In one hand Levi held a small smooth stone.  Levi morphed the pattern in his other hand to recreate the rock perfectly.  I was impressed, it wasn't just a replica it was identical down to the life sparks inside.  I grinned at Levi, "Well done."

I created a simple singular flame in my hand, "And this?"

Levi held his hand out and replicated the dancing flame without a flaw.  He struggled a little but he saw the patterns, "You see the patterns?"

Levi nodded, "I always have.  I just didn't understand.  I thought I was seeing things.  But when I listened to those kids described what they saw you do.  I was like, I see that.  I see you differently, you move differently.  Different than Mr. Hill or Dorian or any of my other instructors."

I laughed, "That's because I'm Cesari.  You do the same thing."

Levi nodded, "I have a class to get to.  Can we talk later?"

I nodded, "That's what I'm here for."  I was happy to help Levi.

Levi nodded, "Alright."  And just as he had arrived Levi was gone out of my bedroom door.  My mood was elevated again.  I glanced at the shower and shrugged.  I was never going to get a shower so I changed my shirt and picked up the files and headed to the Archives to do my research that Kai had approved.  I guess I had work to do now.
