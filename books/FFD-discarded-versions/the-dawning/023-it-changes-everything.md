# It Changes Everything
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 11:30AM_

I finally made it back to the Archives, it was nearly noon and I hadn't made any progress on what Kai asked me to look into.  But that was hardly my fault.  Before I started I figured it was a good time to call Margo's assistant and set up a time for her and my father to meet.

I dialed her number from memory.  I called her that often before there was such a thing as a cell phone.  I wasn't even that old, I'd had a cell phone since I was in my early teens.  But I called Margo more as a child then I did now.  And I still called her regularly.

I called her direct line, but it apparently forwarded to Megan's desk.  The chipper voice answered.  "Dr. Silverman's office, how can I help you?"

I grinned, "Hey Megan.  Margo's busy?"

Megan laughed, "A big client is in a three hour session.  She is not to be disturbed."

"That's fine, I need to set up an appointment for my father to sit down with her and chat about me and how he can _fit_ into things."

I could hear Megan tapping away at the keyboard.  "She's got an hour next week Wednesday for a lunch discussion, since I assume he's not here to talk to her about his issues."

I laughed, "Not to my knowledge.  Can you have the paperwork ready when I get in next week so she can legally let him see my file?  He'll ask, he's as anal about things as Dorian and Dae'lin."

Megan tapped away at her keyboard again, "I can.  It also looks like you need to update your permission for that all around.  Who else should have access so I can set that paperwork up?"

I thought about it.  There was no reason for anyone to ever need to look at my files except me again.  I wasn't a minor.  But ... habits, "Just my father and Dorian."  Dae'lin lost the rights when she told my secrets to someone else, but I didn't say that outloud - I hoped.

I could hear Megan smile, "Alright Nox, I've got that taken care of.  Next Wednesday, Jun 24th at 12pm, Dr. Silverman will see your father.  Would you like me to send you a reminder for your calendar?"

"Yeah, I can forward that to Kai."

"I will send it to him as well, to save you the trouble.  Is there anything else I can do for you?"

"Nope, my standing appointment is booked still?"

Megan laughed, "You know very well that Margo would not overbook that slot.  You've been seeing her every Monday at 9:30 for 16 years.  It's penciled in until the end of time."

I grinned, "Just making sure.  I'll see you then."  And then I hung up the phone and sighed, it was time to actually get back to work with that taken care of.  It was nothing that had to be done right then, but I'd likely forget and I'd hate to disappoint my father.  And I really was procrastinating.  I had to do research, the most dull of things a venatori hunter can do.  But it was necessary.

I pulled the large book of Exuli towards me and wished I had my laptop to access the digital records.  I could hunt down a free to use one but that would waste time I could be doing this.

Thankfully there were books for indexing and I was able to find all the Exuli currently living in Chicago.  There were five families - including Levi's.  It was a small fact that I had forgotten and that nagging feeling like I'd missed something stopped.  It was the missing peice. And that meant I had to go find Levi.

I grabbed all of their files and set out to Dae'lin's office to have someone track down their whereabouts, but I didn't really think it was necessary.  But it was Dae'lin's  or Gary's job to do this and Dae'lin was just easier.  

The annoying ring tone of an unknown caller swept through the stair well.  I was getting tired of not having people in my contacts, I was going to have to fix that.  I answered, "Yeah?"

"Nox?  Have you heard?"  A familiar voice sounded on the verge of anger and concern yet I couldn't place the voice.  

I shrugged as I continued my ascent to Dae'lin's office, "Heard what?"

"Your father..."

I interrupted, "What about my father? I just saw him."

"He's...", my phone beeped in my ear and I pulled it away to see who it was.  It was another unknown number.  

I had to interrupt whoever it was, "Hold on a sec, someone's trying to beep through."  I heard the voice stammering as I put them on hold.  "Yeah?"

On the other side of the phone I heard two voices.  "Turn around."  I recognized the voice, but my mind was already focusing on the heavy breathing of the unknown caller.

I knew that voice, just the sound of it brought back memories from last night.  Dorian...  He spoke softly, "You don't have to do this Levi."

The kid groaned, "Yeah, I've heard that before.  Right before my parents tried to send me here."  I heard a commotion on the other side of the line and Levi shouting, "I'll just do it this way then.  I didn't want to see it in your face."

I don't know what happened but I heard a cry of pain and then footsteps running away.  FUCK!  Dorian... "Shit, Dorian." I shouted into the phone.  I didn't even know if Dorian was alive still.

I was frantic, I fumbled through the apps on my phone and found the tracking application.  Not all monsters were afraid of tech, some that were newly turned were actually pretty tech savvy, it came in handy.

I started the application and then remembered the other caller.  I switched my phone to their call, "Sorry.  But make it quick.  I have to go find Dorian."

"What's wrong with my son?"  He heard the worry in my voice.

FUCK!  Emilio!  "I'm on the line with him.  Something happened, a kid he knows did something.  I'm tracking his phone now.  What's wrong with my father?"

Emilio's voice was seething, "You father is in surgery, he's been stabbed."

"Fuck!  I'll call you back when I've got Dorian."  I hung up I didn't wait for an answer.  I switched back to the tracking app and I followed that signal to Dorian.  It wasn't hard inside this building, we had repeaters and the likes everywhere to make sure the wireless signal was strong everywhere including the basement.

My mind reeled with possiblities.  I didn't know what to expect, I had patterns at the ready just in case Levi was still there.  I knew I had to find Dorian quickly.  I found Dorian lying in a pool of his blood.  I was no healer by any means but I saw the slowly expanding blood stain on his pale blue button up shirt and knew that would kill him later if the stab wound didn't.  I smirked out of habit and Dorian looked at me with relief, but he did give me a questioning look, asking me what's so funny with just his eyes.  I smiled down at him as I pulled my nice clean shirt off and bent down to press it to his bleeding wound.  "I was just thinking that the stain on your shirt was going to kill you later."  He smiled but it looked like it hurt and his head fell into my leg.  "You've lost a lot of blood."

I grabbed my phone and called Emilio back.  "WHAT!" He answered.

I tried not sound bitchy too, it was not a good day for his family - mine either it seemed, "Dorian's been stabbed.  We are outside the elevator on Dorian's level.  Hurry, he's lost a lot of blood."  I hung up the phone as I started hearing Emilio shouting orders around whereever he was.

"Dorian.  You have to stay with me, man."  Damn, he had to stay with me.  "You can't die on my like this.  Not with blood all over.  Old age would fit you sooo much better."  I tried to keep Dorian awake.  I felt him holding in a laugh.  "Oh come on, you can do better than that."

Dorian's voice was low and croaked, "It hurts."

I lifted his head, "Do you trust me?"

He nodded slightly and I smiled at him.  "It might hurt."  I did something I had only done once in my life.  I had to stop the bleeding.  I was no biologist or doctor, but I knew enough.  Enough that maybe he wouldn't die. I didn't do any thing really.  I just gave Dorian's body fuel and resources for the little sparks of life to use.  Raw resources it could use to heal itself.  I feed the patterns to it.  An endless supply.  It drank my power like a dry sponge.  I could feel it sapping my strength but I could handle that if Dorian lived right now.

Dorian cringed against me biting back a howl of pain.  "It's okay.  I'm here.  No one will know."

But the elevator dinged open and Emilio and a medic team rushed out basically calling me a liar.  I was pushed out of the way with ease.  I stood up and towered over the team as they worked on Dorian.  I heard one say "Its not as bad as we were told."  There was releif in her voice.  My only hope was that I hadn't made it worse.

They got Dorian on a stretcher and started wheeling him away but he grabbed my arm and pulled me along until they stopped.  

"We have to talk." Dorian's voice was soft and he sounded as bad as he looked.

I grinned. "I figured as much."

He nodded but they pulled him away before he could say more.  "You can talk later."

I watched as Dorian was wheeled into the elevator.  He smiled at me, reassuring me.  Always the protector.  The look on my face must be bad.  

Emilio put his hand on my arm.  "We'll get these bastards."  I turned to him with a frown.  He was pissed.  So was I.  

"How is my father?"  I asked, I knew I didn't sound as concerned as I really was.

"In surgery.  We won't know for a while."  He looked at me with questions in his eyes. "What did you do?"  

I shook my head, "Saved him."

Emilio pulled me into a tight embrace and held me.  I hesitated before putting my arms around him.  He smelled of pine and a sweetness I couldn't identify.  He made me think of Dorian.  He whispered, "Thank you."

We stayed like this for countless minutes.  I lost track of time while the senior Vega tried to collect himself in my arms.  My thoughts drifted to Dorian and I couldn't help the silent tear that fell.  If he hadn't called me?  If I was just a little longer?  What if I didn't answer the phone?  All the wrong things kept coming to me.  

Emilio finally pulled away with am embarrassed grin.  "Sorry about that."  

I grinned "No problem.  I won't tell a soul."  

Emilio gave a curt laugh, "At least not your father."

I smiled, "No one."

"You are too kind."

"Fair is fair."  I wiped my cheeks with my fingers and Emilio nodded with a weak laugh.  I didn't really care one way or the other but Dorian was so much like his father I knew Emilio would care.

"I'm going to the camera room to find these bastards." 

I nodded.  "I'm going to check around here a while.  Levi was here I might be able to find him.  He couldn't have gotten too far.  We need to initiate lock down."

Emilio nodded.  "I'll call that in.  Find the bastards that is hurting our families."

And that was what I intended to do.  Hurting my father was one thing, but Dorian... that was a completely different story.  It changed everything.
