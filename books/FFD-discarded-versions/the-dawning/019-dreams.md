It was a strained silence as we finished the walk to his apartment door.  I was highly impressed with his status.  The money he'd dropped was impressive but the moment he opened the plain door to his apartment, I was in awe.

The floor was large gray slate tiles, the walls were white except for the accent wall of wood that was a bookshelf and tv stand all in one.  The bookshelf had a few decorative books, glass sculptures and other elegant looking figurines.  I felt like I had walked into a show peice, I didn't want to touch anything.  The furniture was all modern sleek lines in whites and greys, in the middle of the room a white long shag rug was the situated under a low black coffee table, the two couches and an ottoman surrounded the table. 

I gave a long whistle of appreciation.  "Sweet digs." It was more enthusastic than intended with my prior mood.  The kitchen was open, it sported the only color, a deep blood red accent on the bar stools and light fixtures hanging from the ceiling above the bar.  The same color vases and other small items were placed strategcially around the kitchen which was otherwise white and grey with stainless steel appliances.

Dorian was in the kitchen opening a cupboard and pulling out a few things, he was true to his word, popcorn, and of course he was opening a bottle of wine while the popcorn steadily popped in the microwave.  

When the popcorn was decidedly done popping Dorian opened the microwave door and poured the bag into a glass bowl and sat it on the bar.  He looked up at me with his bright blue eyes. "Show you the rest?"  I nodded I didn't trust my voice, I knew I couldn't hide my admiration or my other slightly more obvious reactions.  I had to fight the urge to worry about Dorian wasting his money and status on me.  I was nothing compared to him...

Dorian lead me down a short hallway and opened the door the bathroom. It was elegant too, white with gold accents on everything including the faucets, it was only a half bath.  The only other door in the hallway lead to his bedroom.  

Dorian opened the door and I took in the difference of sceneary.  Instead of the blacks, greys and whites with little color as everything else the walls of Dorian's room were painted a deep blue, the floor was the same throughout the house, all grey tiles made of slate, the bed was dressed in white except for the accent pillows, I was fairly certain that the sheets underneath the white comforter would match the walls.

I smiled, "Not what I expected."

Dorian gave me a weak smile, "Few see my room.  Few get to see the difference."

I turned Dorian and grinned playfully at him, "The playful and colorful side?"  I was slowly returning to my default state.  I disliked showing someone what I was like alone.

"Something like that."  

I turned and headed back towards the living area.  I could feel Dorian's eyes on me as he asked, "What would you like to watch?"

I shook my head and grabbed the bowl of popcorn and a glass of wine.  Dorian picked up his own and the bottle and we sat down on the couch in front of the flat screen tv.  It was far larger than any I had owned myself.  "I haven't seen anything recently.  What do you have?"

Dorian grabbed the remote from the table and flipped the TV on and mashed a few buttons and the Xbox One logo floated through the screen and in a few more taps of the keys on the remote we were scrolling through an impressive list of movies.  I wondered how much of that was from a torrent and I chuckled to myself.  

I saw Dorian look at me with a questioning look, "Was just wondering if you'd illegally downloaded any of the movies."

Dorian laughed, "Oh you know me."

I smiled, "That's why I was laughing.  Such a proposterous thought.  Jace might but you... never."

Dorian scrolled through the movies.  "Wait, go back, I've not see that."

Dorian smiled, "Good choice.  Fun and heroic."

I laughed.  "And it has a cute raccoon in it."  Dorian laughed and pushed play.  The lights automatically dimmed until we were left with only the glow from the movie starting, "Ain't that a sweet trick.  I bet you use that on all the guys."

I had let my mouth run again too long and the uncomfortable silence was quickly filled by Dorian. "You're the first.  I'll have to keep it in mind."  I chuckled and Dorian's voice became even more serious, "I don't typically bring them home.  And I don't think the ones I might have would be so easily impressed by the dimming feature."

I laughed, "I've got simple tastes, what can I say."  We started Guardians of the Galaxy.  The movie jumped straight into the emotional crap.  A kid with a dying mother was probably not the best opener.  I watched Dorian from the corner of my eye as Peter ran after his mother slipped away.  Even I felt that pain slide over me, I couldn't imagine what it was like for Dorian.  The event so raw.  

I picked up the bowl of popcorn that sat between us and set it in my lap as I moved closer to Dorian.  I didn't do it to make a move, but I put my arm across the back of the couch and draped it over Dorian's opposite shoulder and pulled him closer to me.  

He adjusted slightly and leaned against my shoulder.  We watched Starlord dance through trouble and then the fun started Rocket and Grout showed up.  

Things were going well until the prison escape.  I was starting to drift with the comforting scent of Dorian everywhere.  Peter went back for the Walkman he treasured as a child and I felt Dorian shatter.  It was only noticeable because I was holding him against me when his body started to shake with silent tears.  I knew the feeling well, I'd done it too many times to count.  

I pulled Dorian closer and wrapped my arms around him.  He shift with my guidance until we were almost laying down together.  He silently cried in front of me while I buried my face in the back of his neck.  I listened to the movie and hummed quietly in Dorian's ear.  

He relaxed and quieted as the action ramped back up.  I was pinned between him and the back of the couch.  I was warm.  I felt safe holding Dorian against me.  I drifted in and out of consciousness as the movie finished.  

I felt Dorian move away from me but not what he said as he did.  He leaned over and kissed my cheek with a muttered thanks.  I felt the blanket fall over my shoulder before I drifted completely off into a deep dreamless sleep.

The first ray of light in my eyes caught me off guard as I started awake.  I sat up and blinked away the sun as I tried to gather my bearings.  Where the hell was I?

The greys and blacks and whites reminded me I was with Doian.  I found myself under a blanket with a blue pillow underneath my head.  I picked it up and inhaled deeply, it smelled of Dorian.  I could feel my body stir with the scent.  I relaxed into the pillow.  I was lost in his scent.

I made myself put the pillow down, I had to take care of things.  I headed towards the gold and white bathroom.  I noticed Dorian's door was cracked open.  I peeked inside and saw Dorian's sleeping form lying in the bed.  The sheets had been blue as I'd thought.  He looked exquisit lying against the sheets in nothing but a pair of green boxers.  He'd kicked off the blankets and I had full view of his tattoo.  It covered half of his body from neck to ankle.  I wondered how long it had taken and where the tattoo went inside his boxers.  I couldn't help the thought that passed through my mind.  I pushed it away wondering if Dorian was always a violent sleeper or if he'd had nightmares last night.  I hope it wasn't nightmares.

I went back to the bathroom and releived myself.  After I cleaned up a little, wetting my face, washing as best I could I went into Dorian's kitchen and started rummaging around looking for coffee and what other suitable breakfast I could provide the sleeping Scrin in the other room.

Surprisingly I was well rested and coffee didn't seem quite so necessary, but I craved that morning ritual at the minimum. 

I found some  but they were high end beans.  I started them anyway in a coffee maker that looked like it had been used maybe twice.  In the fridge I found eggs and bacon.  I hoped I was't runing any of Dorian's plans, but I was starving and intended to cook for Dorian.

I found my hoodie drapped over the couch, Dorian had helped me get comfortable, I wondered how much I had helped. Because I didn't remember much.  I took my ear buds from my pocket and plugged it into my phone.  It was much later than I thought it was.  8:45.  I'd never slept that late in my life, even if I had a late night.

I started frying bacon in a pan and had eggs ready to go.  I was dancing around cleaning and cooking as I went along and I noticed Dorian sit down at the bar with a smile on his face as he ran his fingers through his dishevealed hair. I smiled at him but I had to pull my gaze away from Dorian's naked upper torso to watch my bacon.  I knew I was smiling like a mad man.   Dorian continued to watch me as I poured two mugs of coffee and set one down in front of him and started working on the eggs.  He never said anything as he sipped at his coffee and watched me cook in **his** kitchen.

I made two plates and set one down in front of Dorian.  I wanted to run my fingers along the top of Dorian's boxers as I walked back behind him but I kept my hands to myself as I sat down next to him to eat my own food.

Dorian took a bite of the eggs and he let out a gracious sigh, "Oh my god.  That was in my kitchen?"

I laughed, "Yes, yes it was."

Dorian took a bit of the bacon he held between two fingers of his left hand.  I never thought I'd see the day that Dorian Vega was eating with his fingers.  I was a bad influence on the man.  He looked at me and grinned, "No one has ever made me breakfast before."

I grinned playfully at Dorian, "That's because you never bring them home."

Dorian nodded, "You are right.  I'm glad you made yourself at home."

I wasn't sure if I detected sarcasm or truth but it didn't matter Dorian was happily enjoying his breakfast, "I was hungry.  And I didn't want to leave without saying anything."

Dorian smiled, "Well thank you for staying.  And thank you for breakfast."  Dorian finished the bacon in his hand and looked back at me, "And thanks for last night."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Anytime."  Dorian started to get up and take his plate with him.  But I was already standing and I ran my fingers gently across his back.  It was probably too bold but I wanted to flirt with him so bad. "I got it.  I made the mess I can clean up."  I reached across his body and grabbed his plate from behind.  I was careful not to press against him.  He watched me, I could feel the caution in the air.  

It was too much, but I heard Dorian laugh, "I think I like this."

I set to cleaning up ignoring the fact that I knew Dorian was watching every move I made.  I felt safe under his watchful gaze.  I didn't want to think too hard about it, or too long.  I knew I'd ruin it somehow.

Everything was cleaned and put in their correct places.  Dorian only corrected me once on the placement of something.    I walked around the bar and stood in next to Dorian in his green boxers as he sat on the blood red bar stool. "I should go grab a shower and change clothes.  I should probably get back to work." 

Dorian looked up at me and nodded, "Yeah.  I have work to do myself." He stared at one another for a while before Dorian broke the silence. "Thank you for spending the night with me.  I appreciate it."  I watched his lips as he spoke and I wanted to kiss them.  I wanted to do so much more but I reminded myself I don't sleep with my friends.

I nodded slowly before I could manage to speak without sounding like I was breathless, "You are welcome.  Anytime.  And I won't tell anyone I was here"  I found it very difficult to walk away from Dorian.  I eventually made myself, "I'll see you later."

Dorian got up and followed me to the door.  I turned around with my hand on the door knob and I smiled at Dorian.  "We need to do this again."

I didn't wait for answer before I opened the door and stepped outside.  There was a woman walking past.  Dorian stood in the doorway as I started down the hall.  I turned around and saw him standing there in only his green boxers.  I can't imagine that was in his normal image but he watched me leave. I gave him a flourished bow and blew him a kiss and heard the woman scoff as she hurried on her way.  I laughed.  Dorian was shaking his head.  I grinned, "I'm sorry I couldn't help it."

Dorian was still shaking his head, "Uh huh."  I gave him a wave of my hand and turned around and headed back towards my rooms.  I needed a shower.
