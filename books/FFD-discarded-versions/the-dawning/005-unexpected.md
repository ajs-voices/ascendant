# Unexpected
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 midday_

I definately wasn't thinking I'd be picked up by a girl at the airport.  Flirting yes?  That much I do anywhere I go, but she asked **me** out.  Granted it isn't a date.  I shook my head to clear the images of the cute little red head with green eyes and a toddler on her hip from my mind.  It was time to head towards baggage claim, needed to grab the rest of my things.  I could have fit everything as a carry on, except for the gun, I'd still have to check that - liscense or no.

When I got down to baggage claim I saw a familiar sight.  There was dirty blonde haired man wearing a pair of faded blue jeans, and a tattered t-shirt of an american flag holding a sign that said, "Nawt Ghay".  The only thing that would complete the picture were if Jace was wearing a straw hat and chewing on a strand of hay.  I couldn't help but laugh.  His sun glasses were propped up on his head and he hung his leather jacket over his shoulder.  He would stop men and ask "Not Gay?"  like he was oblivious to what he was saying.  And in his southern drawl it was clear others weren't exactly getting it either.

A small hand tugged on my ear buds that hung around my neck still.  I turned in the direction and Stella smiled back at me.  Damn she was short.  I grinned down at her.  She asked, "You know him?"

I chuckled to myself as I turned to watch the carosel for my things.  "I should claim that I don't.  But sadly I do."

She grinned at me, "Does he realize what his sign says?"

I grabbed my last bag thankful it made it through just fine, "He does.  It's an inside joke."  I offered Stella my hand, "I'm not gay."  

Stella giggled.  "You should go up and give him a big kiss."

I laughed, it took me a long while to finish laughing, she was a trip.  "Maybe I should."  Maybe I shouldn't.  But it would definately make a scene and that was truly what Jace was after.

I grinned at Stella.  "You asked for it."

I walked up to Jace with a knowing grin on my face.  He looked up at me with ease and I leaned in and kissed him softly on the lips.  He tasted like cinnamon gum.  It overrode his naturaly clean sent, like he'd been hung out to dry on the line.  I pulled back and glared at him and he grinned.  I took the gum out of my mouth with two fingers and offered it back to him and he laughed.  "Hi," I said with a faked breathless grin.

Jace laughed, "Hey lover."  

I rolled my eyes at him and waved Stella over.  "Jace, this is Stella and her son Aidan. That was her idea."

Jace turned to her and offered his hand, "Jason Hill at your service."  His southern drawl was completely gone when he introduced himself.  "You told him to kiss me?  How very daring of you?  Did you know he would really do it?"

Stella laughed, "He told me about his affliction."  She grinned up at me with a teasing smile.

"My affliction...."  I rolled my eyes.

Jace flicked my shoulder with his fingers, "That's a nasty habit.  Be nice to the lady.  Your affliction is contatious afterall."

I smacked Jace in the head, his sunglasses fell to the floor.  He glared at me as he picked them up.  "Stella, you need a lift?"

I refrained from sticking my tongue out at Jace as Stella nodded her head, "That would be wonderful I could catch a cab, but if you are going that way."

Jace grabbed her bags and smiled, "We are going anyway you need us to go.  He ain't in no hurry.  Are you lover?"

I rolled my eyes at him and Stella hit my arm this time.  "What was that for?" I asked shocked.

She smiled, "You rolled your eyes at him."

I stuck my tongue out at her and she smacked me again and I couldn't help but laugh, "He called me lover, he better stop or he's going to find a foot up his ass."

That got a pointed stare from Stella, "Watch your language."  It wasn't a joke.

Jace wrapped an arm around Stella, "Don't mind him.  He's a troubled youth.  He has no manners, and no couth.  Come on Darling, I'll get your bags and we'll take you where you are going."

Leave it to Jace to pick up the girl I was after.  I'd have glared at him if I'd cared really.  To be honest, Jace wouldn't go anywhere with her either, he was married now.  Mia had finally wrangled him into asking and she was pretty intense about his being faithful.

I followed the pair out the doors and listened to Jace bad mouth me some more, Stella looked back with a sheepish grin and I rolled my eyes.  She shook her finger at me and I gave her a dirty look, it was all in jest, I hoped.

I opened the door for Stella as Jace took her bags to the back of the black SUV he'd brought down.  Stella climbed in.  I shut the door after Stella got Aidan strapped into the carseat that seemed to be in the back.

I took my bags to the back of the SUV and Jace was waiting for me.  He grinned up at me, and mouthed, "Damn!"

I grinned back at him and leaned in and whispered, "She asked me out on a not a date."  I beamed at him.  Jace smiled back.  I spoke louder so Stella could hear me, "I see Mia lets you take Naya out and about."

Jace laughed, "She better with another one on the way."

I was impressed Jace had enough prestige now to own his own car, that was a rarity.  Jace smiled, "We live in Brooklyn, kinda need the space."

"Really.  Why the f..."  I paused in my thoughts and corrected my self, "Why would you want to do that?"

"Mia wants a house.  I gave her a house."  Jace confided.  "The woman gets what she wants."  He waved his left hand in front of my face like I didn't remember he'd gotten married.  

I grinned at him, "Seems like you got sucker punched."  I walked around to the passenger side of the car.  

Jace called out, "What you don't want to drive?"

I laughed, "Not on your life."

We both climbed into the SUV and Stella grinned at Jace in through the rear view mirror, "So the sign, tell me about it."

Jace laughed and I had to roll my eyes, Jace loved to tell stories.  He blurted out rather quickly, "We like guys."  He added automatically, "And girls.  I introduce Nox here to a few of my gay friends.  I'm the odd ball out till Nox joined the crew.  They'd ask, 'So you're gay?'"  Jace laughed, "He'd always say, I'm not gay."  Jace poked me in the shoulder and I turned to look out the window, I hated the story.  "He always adds, I like girls too or something to that affect.  Like he's defending his choices."

I sighed, "I defend every decision I make, in everything Jace."

Jace patted my arm, "I know.  You know I tease."  He turned to Stella with a smile, "He had a rough life.  I don't know why he tolerates me picking on him.  Anyone else and I'd be gagging on my tongue."  He grinned playfully, but in reality he wasn't really joking, I was known to stuff air in bullies mouths when they called me names.  I was young then, but the reputation stays with you.  I spent many days in detention for that.

Stella nodded, but I wasn't sure she understood what Jace had been getting at, and really it didn't matter.  Jace smiled at her, his boyish southern charm was not lost on her as she grinned back at him, "So where to madame?"

Stella scronged around in her purse for an address and handed Jace a peice of paper with her reservation on it.  Jace whistled as he showed me the paper, "That's near us, you aren't out of the way at all.  Shall we?"

Jace pulled out into the parking lot and headed towards the City proper.  I looked out the window and remembered my first time fondly.  I was glad to be on solid ground.  I was with Dorian, he smelled of vanilla and cinamon with a hint of pine and musk underneath.  It was comforting.  I hugged Mushu to my little body as Dorian drove me home.  He left me to my thoughts.  

As we drove through the streets of the skyscrapers I was in awe of them.  I wished I was Batman, or Spiderman.  But even then I was afraid of heights, more so than now and the thought terrified me.  The daydreams of a small boy filtered through my head as Stella and Jace chatted about things.

At a stop light Jace punched me in the arm, "Penny for your thoughts, man."

Stella added, "You've been quiet."

I grinned back, "Just thinking about the first time I took this route."

"Tramatic?"  Stella asked with a bit of pity tinging her voice. 

I hid my disgust behind a playful grin, I didn't need anyone's pity, "Hardly.  I was lost in thought most of the way.  It's the last good memory I have of Mushu."  I smiled fondly.

Aidan chirped, "Mushu - rarrrr"

I laughed, "Yes, little man, rarrr.  He was my favorite.  Sadly he burnt the next day."

Stella asked, "Burnt?"

Jace sighed, "There was a fire.  He doesn't like to talk about it.  Our roomate stole Mushu and in the ruckous it created a fire started and the little stuffed dragon became its only casualty."

I sighed as I looked out the window, "It was the first of many such instances."

"You mean losing your toys?"

We both laughed, but I answered her curious questions, "No, of being bullied."

Jace stopped the SUV in front of the Pennsylvania Hotel.  "Nice digs, I'd definitely work for them if they are putting you up here."

Stella laughed, "My mother said it was some fancy rich firm that needed help."  She started packing things up to prepare for her departure.  I got out of the vehicle and pulled her bags from the back.  

"Well maybe we'll just order in then.  I'll foot the bill, if you order for two and a half."  I called from behind.

She turned and beamed at me, her smiled lightened my heart.  "Still keeping me company tonight?"

I grinned, "But of course."  I closed the back door and waited on the sidewalk for Stella to walk over.

She stood in front of me and I russled the boy's hair and he swatted at my hands.  I grinned at him and Stella smiled at me.  "I'll call you later and we can set up a time."

She winked at me as she walked away.  This girl was more confusing than any other.  I don't know why I was seeing her again.  I really should back away before I make things impossible.

When I got back in Jace commented, "Damn!  You haven't even been home an hour yet and you've already got a date."

I rolled my eyes as Jace pulled out into traffic as we headed towards the compound and headed home.
