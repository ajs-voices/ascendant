# Dragon Hunting
_Saturday, June 13, 2015 8:15 PM_

Two weeks in and I was still trying to find my quarry. I stared at the picture in my hand hoping to find some inspiration of where to go next if tonight's jaunt into town was unproductive.

The image depicted a woman with obsidian skin and golden hair. She was not what she seemed. She was a dragon in human form, and there was no doubt about it; she was a beautiful creature. It was frustrating finding her trail and then losing it just as quickly.

However, tonight was not like any other night these past few weeks. I did find myself in another rural town chasing my lady dragon. But this time, a lady in a convenience store around the corner in **this** podunk town just south of Apache Peak knew my lady's name. So tonight, I sat outside a bar with brown peeling paint avoiding the inevitable – going inside. But it was getting late and I was starving.

Inside made me rethink my plans. The smell caught me first thing. It reeked of stale beer and body odor underneath layers of pine scented air fresheners.

I almost turned around and walked out to find some other place to gather information, but my choices were non-existent. I forced myself to walk in and made my way to the bar.

The bartender was just as rough looking as his place of employment. He rubbed his gray peppered beard while he appraised me. "What can I get you, son?" His voice was as gravely as his appearance.

"Just a beer – whatever you've got in a bottle." I flashed him my best smile.

The man gave me that look that said he didn't trust me, but he nodded his head and turned on a slow heel towards the cooler that kept their cold beverages. He called over his shoulder, "What brings you to town, stranger?"

I grinned; I did love it when people pointed out the fact that I was not from around these parts. I may have been born not too far away, but I grew up in Midtown Manhattan and I spoke like a New Yorker no matter how hard I tried to hide it.

I lied to the man, "Just some hiking."

The grisly man turned with an opened beer bottle in his hand. He slid it across the bar with a frown, "Hiking alone is dangerous."

My grin widened as I saw the fresh bottle was a Sam Adams, my brand of choice. I took a quick sip and sighed with refreshment. "Damn, I missed a cold beer."

I looked up at the bartender and lied again. "I'm not alone. I got a _buddy_ sleeping back at camp. He’s a bit worn out." I winked at the bartender; it was always fun making people squirm.

"City slickers like **you** shouldn't be holed up in these woods, likely to get yourself killed."

I could almost hear the threat in his words as I chuckled to myself. "I can handle myself. Trust me, Cowboy." And I meant that in more ways than one.

He turned back to his regular customers with a disgusted look on his rugged face. I could see the hatred for _my_ kind rolling off him in waves.

I grinned; I could have said more, but I had work to do and I couldn't play with the locals. I extended my hearing beyond my optimal range for pretending to be human and listed to the snippets of conversations around me.

The pair of men at the bar with the bartender started talking about me. "What's a queer city slicker out in the woods for? Ain't they all fancy and high priced?"

I chuckled to myself. I was hardly _that_ type of man. I liked men, but I was not like half the gay men you see on TV. I couldn't tell Prada from Gucci even if my life depended upon it. And none of them here had to worry about me making a pass at them, but that was every straight man's fear. _What if he hits on me?_ The easy answer – be flattered and say not interested. I hated bigots. I could turn around and flirt with the woman three stools down, but it wouldn't matter now. I was gay in their eyes. Such was life.

The door jingled its welcome to a newcomer taking me from my thoughts. 

I looked up into the plate glass mirror that was the other side of most bars and saw a stunning woman walk in. My information paid off.
 
She walked towards the bar, and coincidentally me. She moved with the grace of a cat. The patterns were shifting around her – fire pulling in, everything else pushing away forming the shadow of her dragon shape. Each individual scale was almost visible in the pattern. She was gorgeous. It was a shame no one else in the room could see her true beauty.

I gave her a silent catcall. She was even more impressive in person. Her skin was black as night, and her golden hair looked fake but I knew it was soft and as real as the hair on my own head. I wanted to reach out and touch it. The pattern surrounding her was beautiful too. The mirror did not do her justice. I marveled at the sight of her. She wasn't the first dragon I had met – just the prettiest.

She sat down to my left and was waiting for the bartender to come on down to her. She was staring at me with caution.

The man finally came over and spoke to her, "Your order will be right up, Naomi. Don't mind the city slicker here." He threw a nod in my direction, "He'll do you no harm."

I snickered; he thought I only liked men. I turned to face her. I already knew she'd know what I was as I smiled brightly at her and spoke, "That's right, Duckling. I'll not do you any harm." I knew I sounded like an arrogant prick - it was part of my charm.

Naomi's eyes went wide with recognition as she took in the tattoo at my right temple. The pair of crossed swords spoke to exactly what I was, and what I was there to do. She blinked her eyes sideways - a thing only a reptile can do. She was forgetting herself. She hissed at me, "How dihd you find mhee, Ferasss?"

I smiled as I lied through my teeth, "Not hard really." It _had_ been a difficult journey. I had followed her from Denver through some backwater towns to New Mexico. I didn't even know the name of the town she'd stopped in there. She eventually hit a bank in Boulder before I caught back up with her. I suspected she'd been flying. She hit two more small-town banks before I found her here, but no, really it wasn't hard - not at all.

Her words were colorful to say the least. Savage Thing – but so very not human. "But really, Feras? Can't you think up something a bit more human to call me? Like Bastard or Asshole? You **are** pretending to be human. Aren't you, Naomi?"

That was when things went dangerous. Naomi opened her mouth and lunged at me.

I fell backwards landing on my back as I created a pattern of air to shield me from anything she could dish out. My instinct to protect myself was at its highest. I was grateful I had practiced that defensive move as often as I did.

But no fire erupted from the woman's mouth.

I'd learned the hard way that a dragon in human form could still breathe fire. Who-da-thunk that a man could shoot a volcano of flames out of his throat, but I bore the scars to prove it.

She leapt from her place and ran for the door. "Barry, Lex, he's going to kill me, help!"

She bolted out the door and I heard her shouting "Get that thingstarted, we gotta run. There's a Venatori here!"
# They Are Just Human
_Saturday, June 13, 2015 8:35 PM_

The air in the room became thick with testosterone as the men who had been placid before took up arms for their fellow local.  She'd called to two men - a Barry and a Lex, but three men approached me, including the bartender and he had a shotgun.  

I barely had time to stand up before they were descending upon me.  I raised my hands to show I was defenseless.  "I'm not here to kill her.  I swear to god."  I knew wasn't defenseless, I had learned to hide my gift in a fight, but they didn't know that and I really didn't want to reveal too much about my own kind.  That could land me on the other side of the Venatori as well.  

My back was to the bar.  The room was shrinking around me. I turned and now my back towards the door and started backing up before they could close in around me.

A scraggly man wearing overalls and a John Deer hat moved towards the door and tried to block my exit. He looked the quintessential redneck.  Another man spat on the floor as he moved to get behind me as the bartender walked around the bar to stand in front of me.  They were slowly surrounding me.

My heart started to race.  I didn't want to have to fight these men, but it looked like I had little choice.  I had to keep telling myself they were just human.  While I was not super strong or super-fast like true Venatori, I had trained my entire life with them.  I could hold my own in a fight against nearly any monster.  But I didn't want to hurt these men.  They were after all doing what they thought was the right thing.

"Look.  I don't want any trouble.  I just need to talk to Naomi.  She's been doing some pretty bad things.  I don't want to hurt her."

The spitting man had been the one who was thought I was a high priced and fancy gay man.  He was now sneering at me over the pouch of tobacco he was still chewing.  

I swallowed my disgust at the habit and the idea of kissing a mouth like that.  I pitied any woman who loved him.

He threatened me, "I think you want to do more than that.  Naomi's a good woman.  Known her my whole life.  Sweet lady."

The bartender hitched the shotgun making that familiar catching sound as he loaded the gun. The man in the John Deer hefted a pool stick I hadn't noticed him pick up.  The other man was unarmed.  They slowly closed in on me as the bartender stood back aiming the double barrels at me.

I let my senses go wide.  The smell of their cologne hit my nostrils; the smell of tobacco nearly overwhelmed me.  A single fear-filled memory threatened to encompass my mind.  I had to stomp it down before fear tried to take hold of my body.  I could pull the gun from my holster, but I only did that if I truly meant to kill someone, and I'd rather not add to the potential body count.

Everything happened in a blur.  The two men rushed at me at the same time.  The pool stick was the first to connect. It hit my arm as I was dropping to the ground in a crouched leg swipe of the man in front of me.  I reached for the gun at my hip and had it out as I stood up.  I pointed it at the man with the shotgun.  "I don't want to hurt you."

The man I'd laid out on the floor was slowly getting up.  The man with the pool stick was glancing down at him.  The bartender started to shake in fear.

I was most worried about him.  If the gun went off, I'd give myself away truly.  The blow to my arm only ached because of the air shield around me.  But stopping the shot at this close range was going to difficult to explain.  "Drop the gun before you do something stupid."

I turned my head to the redneck with the pool stick, "And you might want to drop the stick."

He stammered at me and took a step closer.

I pulled the trigger on the gun and nicked the bartender’s  ear.  "That's far enough too.  Don't make me hurt you.  Back away from the door and just let me go.  I'm not going to hurt you.  And I'm not going to hurt Naomi unless she tries to kill me too.  I don't take kindly to being attacked.  I will defend myself." 

I waved my gun for the gunman to move and he shuffled to the side with his hand to his ear.  "You hit me."

I grinned at the man, "I did.  Imagine what I could shoot of next."  I adjusted my aim to indicate a general direction.  

The man paled.

My aim moved passed his most prized piece and I grinned at him.  "Maybe a foot?"  I chuckled, "Nah..."  

I didn't have time to adjust my aim again before he sidestepped out of my way completely.  The others kindly remained where they were.  For that, I was thankful.

I never took my eyes off the four men as I made my way to the door.  I had lowered the gun to point at the floor and the men stayed where they were.  I turned only long enough to pry up the spent bullet from the wall and stuffed it in my pocket as I walked out the door.

I heard a scramble inside but no one came after me.  If the human police came I knew how to handle them, it wasn't the first time that I'd had to do it - just the first time on this case.

Now I had lost precious time in following after Naomi and her cohorts.  I was back to square one.  But there was one thing I knew about dragons.  They never roamed far from their hoard.  If the locals knew her, that meant her hoard was close.  I only had to find it.

# Nightmares
_Saturday, June 13, 2015 9:00 PM_

Camp was not too far from the little podunk town but far enough none of the locals bothered me and the lights didn't interfere with the starry sky.

I lay in my sleeping bag staring at the night sky through the tree branches wondering what I was going to do about my little dragon problem.  I wasn't going to sleep anytime soon anyway; might as well think about it.

But as I stared up, my eyes drifted close and sleep soon came.  And with sleep came the nightmares.

It always started the same.  The orange door opening slowly to reveal the darkness inside.  A pair of glowing red eyes, tentacles of air and earth pulling me inside and thrusting me against a wall.  My shirt ripped from my body just before the tentacles lash my back and I feel the tearing of my skin.  Followed by the creepy crawly feeling of my skin knitting back together.

The smell of tobacco and patchouli oil permeated the air as a voice spoke in the darkness, "You are an abomination."  The voice grated with hatred that sounded a lot like what I remembered of my mother.  More strikes followed.  The voice has changed to something much more masculine and something far darker.  "I will control you."  Fear lanced through my sleeping body.

_Sunday, June 14, 4:35AM_

I started awake like I always do just before the face comes into view.  My heart was pounding.  Sweat drenched my skin and hair. Phantom pain danced along my back as if old wounds had been broken open.  I lay in my bag trying to catch my breath and slow my breathing at the same time.  

The panic attack doesn't subside as quickly as I'd have liked.  I look for five things I can see in the dim moonlight – the ring of rocks around my fire, the stars in the sky, the leaves of the tree above me, my gear bag, and the moon lighting my vision.  

My breathing slows a little as I look for four things I could touch.  I reached out reflexively to the ground and grabbed a handful of dirt and leaves; two with one go.  My sleeping bag , and the hair on my head as I run my long fingers through it and get caught on a knot from all my tossing and turning.  It reminds me I need to cut my hair.

I could feel my heart rate slowing.  I continued the exercise I had been doing since I was six years old.  Three things I could hear – the crickets in the night air, a wolf howling in the distance.  I had to strain, but I could hear the quiet babble of the nearby creek.  The water was soothing and I could feel my breathing slow.

I took a deep breath and searched for two distinct smells; there were always so many.  The scent of pine was everywhere.  The forest smells were almost the smell of being safe – almost.  Underneath I could smell the decay of dead leaves on the ground.  

Finding one taste was always the hardest to get but I could feel my body slowly returning to its natural state.  My heart was not racing anymore; my breathing was shallow as I focused on it in meditation.  I knew that there was coffee in my bag and I could almost taste it. 

My phone lay next to me and I picked it up and glanced at the time.  It was close enough to dawn to rise early.  

The night was still cold as I pulled myself out of my sleeping bag.  The fire had long since gone out.

I reached for the patterns of fire I had memorized as a child and created fire from nothing.  

The fire burst into a small flame that took the chill off the night air.  The orange flickering light made the shadows dance around me.  The smell of the campfire soon overrode every other smell around me. 

I could get lost in the comforts of the forest.  This was the only time I didn't miss the city.  I prepared a pot of coffee in the percolator and set it on the fire to brew while I did my morning routine. 

My routine was part of my coping mechanisms.  I had **a lot** of coping mechanisms.  The morning strength training and yoga helped establish my mood.  Without them and coffee, I grew anxious.  My schedule had always been my lifeline – in the field it was hard to keep one, but I managed.

The coffee started to smell wonderful on the night air.  

It invigorated me without a sip.  The smell was intoxicating.  But I didn't rush through my routine, it was slow and each movement was done with precision.  Perfection was demanded.  Dae'lin, my mentor, had demanded it of me as a child, and I now demanded the same of myself.

The smell of coffee soon turned bitter as the fire overcooked it and it started to evaporate in the percolator.  It was ruined.

I finished my workout with disappointment.  After cooldown, I lifted the pot out of the fire with a pattern of air and poured the burnt coffee into my tin cup.  It would have to do; I didn't feel like brewing another pot.

I had a decision to make – rather a plan to figure out.  Last night had been a bust.

The map I pulled out was littered with all sorts of notes.  It was a local hunter’s guide map to the supernatural.  There were houses marked as haunted, were bear caves.  But nothing ever said Dragon's lair. 

I had scanned the map several times already, but one more time wasn't going to hurt as I sipped the burnt coffee and poked at the last of the roasted rabbit from yesterday.  I'd actually have to hunt again soon or I'd be stuck with canned beans and I'd rather not.

The world was full of myths and legends based on reality.  Reality was a lot less dramatic than it seemed in the movies. Supernatural creatures care a great deal about the humans they intermingle.  Most were formerly human.
I leaned back against a log that I was using as a makeshift table, chair, whatever furniture I needed at that moment and stared up at the lightening sky.  Dawn had been closer than I thought.

My thoughts drifted through myths about dragons. Dragons were magical creatures.  If only the fairy tells did them the justice they deserved.  Naomi had been beautiful – dangerous but beautiful.

In King Arthur, maidens were staked in front of caves for dragon sacrifices.  And in other stories dragons used caves to stash their hoard.  If I recalled correctly in Pete's Dragon - a Disney flick I had been obsessed with as a child, the dragon lived in a cave.  Caves seemed to be a running theme.  It was at least a good place to start.

The thought of the childhood movie brought back fond memories.  My nanny had been a dragon.  The day I had sparked she'd been sick.  I made a mess.  My mother got angry.  The fear pierced my calm and I pushed it away.  I didn't need to think about that.

I pulled the map close and started scanning the topography.  Reading maps had finally come in handy – another stupid class that finally is paying off.  It had been a while but I looked at the map and I searched for the best possible place a dragon could hide her hoard.
# Treasure
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 6:00 AM_

Narrowing down the exact location hadn't been hard once I had a place a general idea of what I was looking for.  It was still early; there was barely enough light to see by but I packed up camp anyway.  I had every intention of going home once this was all said and done.  Home being a relative term - back to where I was staying - to a real bed - that was my goal.

The roads were narrow and had steep inclines and declines on both sides.  They were cracked and gravel strewn across them like someone had just dumped buckets of grit and grim on them.  The Jeep was a great vehicle for driving on these roads.  The four wheel drive came in handy, but even that didn't make me feel any better as I navigated the near ledges that these mountains called roads.

I could feel my heart racing as I drove carefully along the crooked roads of Apache Peak as I neared the closest location to where Naomi could be hiding.  I was careful not to look over the edge too often as I drove past a particularly narrow turn.  

By the time I had reached the closest possible point the road could take me my anxiety was through the roof.  My heart was racing.  I was probably ash white and covered in sweat.  Heights were not my favorite and after the night I had I was more than ready to walk through the woods for a while.

The forest was normally full of woodland sounds, but this dreary morning there was not a chirp of an insect or even the ruffling of leaves as a critter would pass by - nothing was making a sound.  

I could feel the adrenaline rising with each step - the quiet only made things more eerie.  I was not only stalking my pray, I knew she was stalking me.  It was a game of hide-and-seek and we were both 'it'.  

My phone started singing happily along as it rang in my pocket.  

I jumped.  I hadn't been expecting anyone to call me and I'd forgotten to put my phone on silent.  I struggled to untangle it quickly from my pocket to silence the obnoxious noise that felt louder than it really was.  I swiped my thumb across the answer button and was putting it to my ear when I saw a blur of motion.

I started to say, "What do you want, Dae'lin?  I'm kinda busy at the moment."  But I barely got any of it out as sharp claws dug into my shoulders and legs and I flew backwards.  I landed on my back with a small black and gold dragon perched on top of my body. She started to open her mouth.

I could feel my body tense as I prepared for the inevitable volcano of flames while at the same time I wove a pattern of air so strong that she was flung from my body in one horrifing gush of air.  I could feel her talons ripping through my flesh as she launched herself into the sky.

I lay staring up at the trees above me where the dragon had once been trying to catch my breath.  I could feel my wounds knitting together.  It was a feeling I hated almost as much as getting hurt.  I heard in the quiet of the forest a tinny voice yelling my name, "Nox!"  I couldn't help but roll my eyes.  Dae'lin had to call right then.  I sighed as I rolled over.  The blood was making my clothes stick to my body and would soon hardern and make things even worse of a mess.  I could still hear Dae'lin's voice calling my name.  I hoped she kept it up as long as the line stayed opened.  

I searched where I had fallen but couldn't find my phone.  I had to draw on my extended hearing to locate the pile of leaves my phone had fallen into.  I collapsed against a tree and dusted off my phone before putting it to my ear.  "I'm here."

I could hear the small brunette's anger and her concern as she vaulted into yelling at me.  "What the hell was that, Nox?  What happened?  Are you okay?"

I smiled to myself, Dae'lin would forever and always be my mentor before she was my boss.  "I'm fine.  I'm close to the end game here, what do you want?"

Dae'lin harrumphed over the line and I could almost see the fury on her face as she laid into me.  "Never do that again!  I didn't know what had happened."

I rolled my eyes.  "Dae'lin it's part of the job.  You know this.  You called in the middle of a hunt.  What did you expect?"

The small sigh from the other end of the phone made me a little anxious, she really had been worried for my safety and I was not exactly playing nice.  I apologized, "Sorry, I worried you.  I'm fine, nothing a little R n R won't heal.  You didn't call to chat, what did you need?  I need to finish this hunt before she gets away."

"You'll have to leave it Nox.  Come home.  We need your talents here."  I could hear the command in her voice, she was no longer my mentor or caretaker, she was my boss now.  

I sighed.  "I'm almost done."

Dae'lin's voice rose to her angry pitch.  "Now, Nox.  We need you now!  I expect you here at tomorrow morning's briefing."  There was a small pause before Dae'lin included, "And that's an order, Nox."  She hung up the phone without my consent to come.  She knew I had no real choice in the matter.  

But I was so close.  I leaned against the tree while the wounds finished healing  and I thought about exactly what I was going to do.  This wasn't a dangerous dragon - not really.  She was robbing banks and got caught.  But it was my job to take her down.  I had no intentions of killing her, but she didn't know this.  I wasn't exactly playing by typical Venatori standards.  

I used my phone to check out flight arrangements.  I still had to get to the Denver Airport - a 2 hour drive.  Briefings were usually around 9am.  The only non-stop flight was at midnight.  So I had several hours to kill.  I booked the flight.  I could still make the damn meeting and at least try to catch my dragon.  I felt better about that.

My new wounds were as healed as they were going to get.  Add some new scars to the running total.  I had to think up a fun story about that.  But that was for another time.  I pushed myself up from the ground and headed in the direction Naomi's dragon form had flown.  Thankfully it was the same direction I had been going before, my theory had been correct.

The noises of the forest didn't return as I'd hoped.  She still lurked in the shadows and I was still prey.  The sun was moving higher in the sky as each minute passed. 

I glanced at my phone which I now had on vibrate just in case Dae'lin decided to call me again to remind me.  She'd been known to do it before.  It was nearly two hours since she'd called and I was just not peering over the edge of a rise looking into the crag that I beleive to have Naomi's hoard.

A piercing wail came from inside.  It wasn't pain or fear, was just a squalling child.  All sorts of things ran though my mind, but Naomi hadn't been a bad woman... dragon.  She'd only been caught on camera doing impossible things while doing what dragons do - collecting things for her hoard.  

I doubted that inside the cave there would be mounds of gold coins or even gems, but I expected that she had a tiddy little sum stashed inside.  She'd robbed over two dozen banks that I could connect to her.  We would try her publicly as a human court - she'd been caught by human servalene it was protocol if they were caught.  Most Venatori didn't catch their marks.  It was shoot first, ask questions later.  I didn't work that way.  I'd hurt enough people in my life already I didn't need to do it to strangers too.  I only killed when necessary.  I hoped today wasn't necessary.

I crept into the cave, it was dark and smelled damp and mildewy.  It took me a moment to focus past the scents and peer into the darkness.  The entrance was narrow and I scrapped my arm and knees on a few outcroppings before the opening gave way to a large cavern inside.  The wail echoed inside the cavern again, my ears rang from the resonance.

I created a small ball of light above my head, it was a simple pattern, one every child magnus knew.  The yellow pool of light let me see enough to see a small child sitting mere yards from where I stood.  My light caught his attention and his cry cut short as he peered up at me.

The child had a much lighter version of Naomi's golden hair and the skin of soft alabaster.  I could see the faint red glow of hot embers peaking out from behind his shirt.  It pulsed with each pounding heart beat.  There was no form of dragon behind the toddler, but the patterns shimmered like nothing I had ever seen from anyone.  He lifted his nose in my direction and sniffed the air, much like a dog might do when trying to catch their prey's scent.  

The boy struggled to stand and I wanted to go to him but I didn't want to be distracted.  He toddled towards me and I let him come close but I watched the surrounding cavern with my back to the nearest wall.  I wasn't going to get jumped again.

He came to me and held up his arms with a soft whimper.  I smiled down at him, "Where are your parents?"

The boy stared up and me and urged me again to pick him up.  I reached down under the boy's arms and lifted him gently and settled him against my body.  He buried his face in the crook of my neck and shoulder and purred.  The boy was extremely warm to the touch.  

I heard a rock skid across the floor as a bullet flew wide of my location.  "Set the boy down," a voice echoed through the cavern.  

The boy curled closer to my body and squeezed his arms tighter around my neck.  "I don't think he wants me to do that.  Come out and we can talk about this."  I doubted he would listen to me, but the boy really didn't seem to want me to let him go.

A figured moved in the shadows in front of me.  I brightened the small floating light above me and I could see the cavern in its full glory.  It was filled with paintings along the wall, priceless statues and there were even a few small safes sitting precariously throughout the cavern.  She was more than a bank robber it seemed.  I asked, "Where is Naomi?"

The man shook his head like he was confused by what I said. "Let the boy go," he demanded.  He took aim with the pistol at me and the child.

I shook my head.  "You'd endanger your son like that?"  I pulled at the little boy but he clung to me like I was saving him.  I whispered to him.  "It'll be alright.  Nothing will hurt you.  I promise."  He looked up at me with those orange eyes and blinked sideways.  He let go and I set him down on the ground.  "Stay there."  I wove a shield of air around the boy, he wouldn't get hurt.  I promised him that and I meant it.  

I turned to the man who was tracking me with his pistol as I moved away from his son.  "Alright.  I put him down.  Now where is Naomi?"

The man continued to point the gun at me as he hurried towards the toddler.  He bounced off the shield of air and he looked at me with daggers in his eyes.  I released the pattern.  "I was only protecting the child from any stray bullets.  You can reach him now."

He tried to go towards the boy again and this time didn't find my barrier in place.  The boy didn't reach for his father but let him pick him up.  "Where is Naomi?" I asked again.  I was getting impatient.

"Not here.  And why would I tell a Ventori where she is?  You are just going to kill her anyway."

I sighed. "No.  She'll go in for a trial.  I don't kill my marks unless they try to kill me first."

He laughed at me.  "Yeah right.  I don't believe you.  Naomi says all you do is kill her kind."

I nodded, "Most of us do.  But I don't."  I could go into details but I doubt he'd listen nor care what I had to say about the Venatori way.  "Where is she?  You can't show off your abilities and not be punished.  I'm only here because she revealed herself to humans.  We can't have that."

He wrapped himself around the boy.  "If you take her away, who will protect us?"  He sounded lost and sad. 

"Protect you from whom?"  I wasn't sure why they would need protection.

"From other dragons."  He said it like it was the only obvious answer.  

"Why do..."  I didn't finish my sentence as dragon lore 101 came into my head.  Dragons kill their hybrid offspring.  "He's half human?"  _Duh!_

He nodded his head.  "I'll make sure no one hurts the boy.  But I need to take you and Naomi in."

He frowned and turned to run away with the boy in his arms.  I quickly made a barrier of air around him and the child and shook my head.  "Sorry.  You are staying right there.  I'll be back once I get Naomi."

I left the cavern to the sounds of the man screaming for me to let him go.  No one would harm him or the boy as long as I lived.  The shield keeping him in, would keep anyone out.  

I still didn't know where Naomi was, but she couldn't be far.  I called out, "Come on, Naomi, let's talk this out.  You got caught.  You know the rules."

I placed a barrier of air on the cavern door.  She wouldn't get in and no one would get out.  I wished I could just enclose a net around the area and confine her, but I didn't know where she was.  And I didn't think on as little sleep I had I'd manage that much power without passing out.  I knew my limits.

I took a few steps away from the cavern and a not so human voice called out from someplace in front of me, "You smell like Drake.  Why?"

"Drake?"  I asked confused.  Her son?  "The boy?"

Out of the sky she swooped down and knocked me over before taking flight again.  She'd learned one lesson anyway.  "He's fine, with his father."

She flew at my fallen form on the ground and I wove a net of air and wrapped her in it just as she was about to dig her talons into my body for a second time.  Her wings tangled with the filiments of air and she collapsed to the ground.  "Sorry Duckling.  But you aren't going to win like that."  I got up slowly and then knelt down by her dragon form head, "Your son is fine."

"They'll kill him." Even in dragon form I could tell she was sad.

I shook my head, "No, they won't.  I won't let them."  You don't fucking kill children!  You don't give them away, you don't treat them like nothing.

Naomi shifted to human, still inside my net of air.  

I watched in amazement as the bones shifted and the scales turned flesh.  I could see the shadow of her dragon form take shape and hide in the patterns around her.  I stared in awe.

She glared at me, "What are you looking at?"

I laughed, "Nothing.  Never seen a shift before."

She cocked her head at me like I was some strange vision before her.  "You are a strange, Feras."

I grinned at her.  "I'll let you go if you come with me.  You know the rules Naomi.  I could kill you now, or you can plead your case.  I'd prefer the latter."

She nodded and I let the net of air go.  "Why would you do this?  For me?  For Drake?  Why stick your neck out for us?"

I smiled.  "I have my reasons.  Your son will be safe.  I'll do everything I can to insure that."  

Now I only had to take them back to HQ and deal with paperwork.  I'd still make my meeting and Dae'lin would be happy.  
# Small Distractions
_Saturday, June 13, 2015 11:00 PM_

Things at HQ had gone as poorly as I had anticipated.  They were pissed I'd brought home yet another monster.  It meant more paperwork for them.  I didn't mind doing my side of things. Three hours filling out the required forms for three prisoners was better than having to kill a mother and a father of a small child.  Poor kid.  I knew he'd be sent to New York and watched inside the Academy - much like I had.  He'd grow up like I did.  I wished there was something I could do.

I took a cab to the airport.  It was a joy not having to drive around.  I was going to enjoy being back in the city without the need to focus on driving.  I could get lost in my own thoughts.  That is when I went anywhere, everything I really needed was inside the Apex Unlimited Building.  There was really never any reason to leave.

The closer we got to the airport the more apprehensive I became.  I could feel the tension in my shoulders, the tightening of my jaw, I felt like I could split wood with my teeth.  My palms were sweaty and I was snappy.  I hate being snappy. 

The lady at the ticket counter brought a smile to my face, she was a cute blonde with green eyes.  I mentioned a pair of emerald earrings that had once caught my eye as they dangled from some woman's ears.  "I bet they'd be divine against your neck."  She thought I was hitting on her and she grumpily handed me the ticket and checked my bags.  If I had been hitting on her I would not have mentioned another woman I sighed to myself.  It didn't really matter I was going home - by plane.

And then every bit of panic in my body started to show again.  I reigned it in quickly as I walked through the security check points.  Arms out, patted down because my gear was dangerous.  I only had one gun, but still I declared it at the counter and it was now safely stored in my luggage, but now I got the special treatment.  It could be coincidence, but I don't beleive in coincidence.  Everything happens for a reason, you just don't know what it is until later.

I found my terminal and sat down, there were several passengers waiting around already, I still had an hour to wait.  This was almost the hardest part - almost.  It came a close third.  I hate waiting.

There was an elderly couple sitting across from me.  The man kept glancing at me and I'd smile.  I couldn't figure out what he was doing.  Do I look that threatening?  I glanced down at my shirt and laughed.  I hadn't realized what shirt I'd pulled on.  "Wanna screw?"  A hand was holding out a screw.  It wasn't a lewd as some of my other shirts were, but I could have chosen better for a public situation like this.  I zipped up the hoodie that I was wearing to cover up the offending saying and the man nodded in thanks.  I couldn't help but chuckle to myself as I pulled out my phone and started reading whatever book was currently open in my queue...

It wasn't long before my section of rows was called and I was heading to the back of the plane.  I hated the back of the plane.  I hated the front and the middle too, but I really despised the back of the plane.  Thankfully I was not near the engine but still I hated the back of the plane.  I stowed my gear in the upper bins after grabbing my ear buds so I could listen to some tunes to calm down after we got in the air. 

I looked down in the seats and saw a cute little red head scrambling to fasten her seat belt as a small auburn haired kid started shuffling with the things she'd carefully balanced on her lap.

Someone tapped my shoulder, "Can you put this up there please, son?"

I smiled down at the elderly woman who'd been with the man who'd been offended by my shirt.  "Yes, ma'am."

"Such a poliet young man."  I heard her husband scoff at the thought.  "Oh hush Henry, it wasn't that bad."  She turned over to him and said ever so sweetly, "Wanna screw?"

I couldn't help but bark out a laugh as the old man blushed.  "Sir, I think you've got a keeper."

"45 years my boy, 45 years.  And she'll never change."

I grinned down at her, "There you go, ma'am.  I'll help you get them down when we land."

"Such a kind lad."  She patted my hand as she sat down across from me.

The cute little red head was busying herself with prep work for toddler in her arms.  I had to step aside to let a few other people pass before I could finish what I had been doing.  I pulled out the magazine I'd picked up inside the terminal.  I sat down with magazine and ear buds and the little red head next to me tapped my arm and I turned to look at her bright green eyes.  "You sure you don't want the window seat."

I shook my head and hoped my skin didn't turn that wonderful shade of white that gave away my fear.  I wanted to say there is no way in hell you'd get me that close to a window, but I didn't.  "No, this is okay."

She smiled and sat down working on the things she had been doing when the little boy climbed into my lap.  She scooped him up in her arms before I could even react, "Aidan, no."

I smiled at her, "It's alright, he won't hurt me." I winked at her, "Pretty sure a kid can't dent me."

She grinned, "You'll regret that later.  He is quite strong.  Seem him bench press his truck."

I laughed, "Have you now?  I'd like to see that."  

The preflight checks started and I listened to the tinny version of the annoying details.  I fought with the feelings of dread as they talked about the oxygen masks and the seat cushions as floatation devices. A little hand tugged at the ear buds that hung around my neck.  He pulled out of his mothers lap and into mine.  She reached for him with a disapproving frown, "It's okay.  You are sitting right here, the plane's all closed up I'm not going anywhere.  He won't hurt me or the ear buds.  And besides he seems like the perfect distraction while we take off."

She sighed with a nod but she watched me warily.  I didn't blame her.  Though I don't know why he wanted to crawl into **my** lap.  Kids always seemed to like me.  I have no idea why, maybe it was the relative age difference.  Margo and Dae'lin are always telling me I'm a child.  I grinned at the thought.

The little one tried to put my ear buds in his mouth, I pull it gently from his fingers, "Your ears, not your mouth."  I held the bud to his ears.  "When we get up higher I'll show you."

The plane jolted forward and I went backwards into my seat. My heart jump into my throat.  I hated this part.  Up and down were always the worst, down the hardest, but I had a little one in my lap right now.  I focused everything on him.  I could see small patterns around him flux and wane with each movement as he shook my ear buds.  I held out my hand and he dropped the ear buds in my hand and picked it back up and started dancing them around my hand again.  I watched the boy with curiousity.  I'd never seen patterns around a child so young.  Then again I'd never been around a child this young before except for myself and I can't see my own pattern.  I don't really understand why not, I just can't.

I took a deep breath to settle my nerves, but I don't think it worked.  Maybe conversation would help.  "My name is Nox, by the way."

She smiled up at me, "Stella.  And this is Aidan."

"Pleasure."  I beamed at her.  I hoped she didn't notice the sweat beading at my temples.  

The little one started complaining about his ears and climbed into his mama's lap and dozed off to sleep.  I couldn't help the grin that played on my lips.  It reminded me that I'd just ruined the life of another kid only hours ago, the grin faded into nothingness.  I hadn't even been home for an hour before Dae'lin called.  How had she known?  How long had she been trying to get a hold of me.

I put the earbuds in and started flipping through my phone in Airplane mode to find something to listen to when Stella asked, "What brings you to New York?"  She whispered softly so not to distrub her son.

"Been called home.  Boss lady says 'come' so I come."  I tried not to grin at the alterior meaning to the topic I'd just answered.  Dae'lin wanted more than that in reality.  I'd heard through the grapevine, namely Jace that Dae'lin and a few others were in strict negotiations with the breeders program over who got first crack at me like I was some prize stud to be fought over.  I tried not to sneer but I was sure it played on my face before I could mask it with my playful grin.

Stella hadn't noticed at all she was looking at her sleeping son.  "My mother set up a job interview.  She told me to take Aidan too.  Said they had a day care, and that way he'd not be a stranger when I got the job."

I nodded, "Sounds like a good place to work.  Daycare in New York can be expensive."

She smiled at me, "We'll see.  I have my reservations."  She obviously didn't want to talk too much about it, she changed the subject back to me, "Do you like what you do?"  I could live with that, I never turned down an oppurtunity to talk about myself.

"I love my job.  I get to see the world, meet new people."  I winked at her and grinned. I knew exactly what the next question was going to be before she even asked it, but I let her ask.

"What exactly do you do?"  I could hear the curiousity in her voice.

I had a lie for everything I did.  I'd claimed to be a bounty hunter from time to time, but I didn't think it would do much good with Ms. Stella here.  So I choose what my business card actually said, "I'm a security consultant."  Which in reality was what I did.  I secured the fate of the human race by hunting down and executing rogue supernatural creatures.  

She grined at me and shook her head in disbelief.  "You look too young to be a consultant of anything."

Too young to do what I do.  Few hunters lived much longer, stupid mistakes or underestimating the opponent typically cost us our lives.  Too young.  I laughed softly, "I had a very good teacher."  I could hear the praise in my own voice, "I was helping her many years before I actually finished highschool."

"Her?"  Stella's voice was filled with surprise.  "Most security jobs are held by men."

I grinned at her.  "Our firm has more men than women, but she is not a field worker, she's the one who assigns all the jobs.  She's a manager, and a mentor.  She taught me what I needed to know to do my job on top of all the other things that you need to make your life a prosperous one."

She shook her head, "Sounds hokey to me."

Stella was right it was a bit hokey.  "I suppose private schools get that luxury."  Another half truth, it was the only thing I could really tell her.  I couldn't exactly tell her the truth.  That I was raised by a race of supernatural creatures whose sole purpose in live was to polic the other supernatural creatures and exact justice for human kind.  Yeah I'd be put in an insane asylum for muttering such non-sense.

A grin spread on Stella's face as she giggled softly, "A wealthy brat then?"

Wealthy, god no.  I had a lie for that too.  "No, scholarship kid.  I was sent there because my mother couldn't handle me anymore.  They paid my way through so I could get my head on straight."  It wasn't really a lie.  While it wasn't a scholarship, the Venatori don't use money like humans do.  We own nothing, we don't earn money. And wealth is not determined by dollars but by status. 

She laughed softly and I wasn't sure if she was laughing at me or with me, "You don't look like you were a troubled child."

She didn't know the half of it.  I winked at her, "Looks can be deceiving, Duckling."  My life was a disaster and a half, I am surprised I made it through it as well as I did - unwanted, beaten and bullied being only the top three things that messed me up.

Her eyebrow raised and a micheivious grin split her lips in two, "Duckling?"

I had explained it so many times I was surprised she hadn't hit me already, I chuckled to myself, "Soft, Cute..."

"And?"  I felt like she almost could see through me.  Like she knew what I had meant by it.

I grinned coyly at her, "In need of protecting.  It's usually what I call most women."

She asked with intent, "Most?"

This woman was digging rather deep into me, I sighed.  "Dae'lin would kill me if I called her Duckling to her face."

"Your boss/mentor?"  It was not really a question she knew the answer already I could tell by the way she held herself.

I nodded, "How'd ya guess?"  The sarcasm dripped from my statement.

"Just lucky I guess."  She smiled at me and I knew she was at least flirting with me.  I had missed talking to people.  I'd missed flirting more.  "You like her?" she asked.

I shrugged offhandedly.  "She's a good woman. I look up to her."

"Now you are being coy.  You know that's not what I meant."  She laughed at me, and I couldn't help but grin back at her, she was feeling me out for my attachments to other women.  How cute.  Though she was a human woman, and I'd slept with plenty of them, but Stella had a child.  I couldn't risk that.  But chances of seeing her again were slim so I could flirt safely.

"Are you asking me if I'm attracted to her and that's the reason I don't call her Duckling?"  She nodded and I shook my head in return.  "She's a beautiful woman, but she'd kill me if I thought of her as anything more than at most a friend."  I paused a moment as the memories of her catching me with Nick plowed through my memories.  "She went ballistic when she caught me kissing someone in the halls.  Granted I'm sure it was for more than one reason."

Stella laughed, "And those reasons are?"

Oh my god, this woman was really digging into my personal life, what was she a shrink.  I didn't need another one in my life.  "Boy you sure want to get personal."  I sighed and answered her question.  "We worked together, he was my chemistry lab partner.  She frowns upon work place relationships.  Which filtered down into my schooling."

A rosy color spread from Stella's cheeks across and her neck, as she blushed, "He?  Oh.  I thought..."  

She was clearly embarrassed by the assumption that I was now gay and just being friendly.  I wasn't just being friendly, and I reassured her. "You thought that I was flirting."  I grinned at her then leaned over and whispered.  "You are not incorrect in your assessment of things. I am fond of both sexes.  Though it's not something I ususally lead with."

"I'm sorry." She grinned, "I thought my radar was off.  I've not met anyone since having Aidan.  Life has been too busy."

I smiled, "No apologize necessary.  Your radar is just fine."

The planed dipped for its final decent and my heart choked me as I felt the altituded change.  My hands flew to the arm rest and I could feel the tender flesh of the woman beside me below my death grip.  I closed my eyes and gathered my senses around me fighting the gripping panic attack that coursed through my body.

Stella pulled her hand from underneath mine and smiled, "Not a fan of flying"

I could feel the heat rising in my cheeks and my neck, "Not a fan would be an understatement."  I opened my eyes and looked at the cute little red head and her sleeping son.  "My first flight was not a good one."  I didn't really want to talk about it.  I had learned long ago that many of my issues stemmed from that abandonment of my mother.  My fear of flying is wrapped so tightly around it that it's hard to separate one from the other because the memories are so ingrained in one another.  I sighed, "I'm just glad that it all worked out so well." My statement dripped with sarcasm, and I hoped Stella would not pick up on it.

Once the doors were finally open and the cabin started to move I stood up and stretched my legs, I pulled the little old ladies luggage from the overhead bin and handed it to her.  She patted me on the arm, "Such a nice young man.  And that was such a nice young girl, I'm sorry you don't like girls."

Damn!  The woman had overheard our conversation and now thought I only liked men.  Not that it should matter, I was used to the bigotry that went with it, though she wasn't chastising my choices, only apologizing for the loss of a great girl.  I looked down and Stella and Aidan had already slipped past me, Damn! So much for that.

I fished a few more bags from the overhead compartments before I was the last one on the plane and ready to get back to solid ground.  The stewardess thanked me for the assitance and I grinned back, I really wanted to get out of the plane.

Once I was back inside the terminal on solid ground I could feel the world lifting from me.  I could see the familiar skyline and knew that I was home.  Truly home.

I sat down in one of the chairs to slow my panic and fears.  I had been able to hold it together, I'd help from a lovely little red head I was unlikely to see again.  I put my elbows on my knees and hung my head in my hands.  Moments later I saw a pair of small green chucks in my line of sight.  I looked up and Stella was smiling down at me.  "Maybe we can get some dinner tonight?  You can tell me a little about New York and what it offers me and Aidan?"

I leaned back in the chair and grinned up at her, "Isn't that my line?"

She grinned at me, "Not this time... Duckling... It's not a ..."

I intetrrupted her, "No worries Duckling.  Not a date, got it!."  I grinned at her with a wink.  "I'd love to."

I pulled my wallet out of my back pocket and handed Stella a nondescript business card.  "Call me with a time.  I'm sure I'll have to shift things once I get in.  Dinner will likely have to be late.  If that's okay?"

She smiled at me as she took the card and glanced at it.  "That's fine, but I'll need a babysitter after 7 pm."

"I can bring it over, that way we don't have to worry about the time, eat in, talk in peace and Aidan can do whatever Aidan does."

She smiled and leaned over and kissed my cheek.  A chill ran up my spine.  "Thank you, that sounds great."  If it wasn't a date, then it made me wonder what the kiss had been for.  I know I'm irresistable but she clearly said it wasn't a date.  Women are so confusing.

I watched as Stella left, I could still feel her lips on my cheek and I stayed in my chair dazed by what had just happened. 
# Unexpected
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 midday_

I definately wasn't thinking I'd be picked up by a girl at the airport.  Flirting yes?  That much I do anywhere I go, but she asked **me** out.  Granted it isn't a date.  I shook my head to clear the images of the cute little red head with green eyes and a toddler on her hip from my mind.  It was time to head towards baggage claim, needed to grab the rest of my things.  I could have fit everything as a carry on, except for the gun, I'd still have to check that - liscense or no.

When I got down to baggage claim I saw a familiar sight.  There was dirty blonde haired man wearing a pair of faded blue jeans, and a tattered t-shirt of an american flag holding a sign that said, "Nawt Ghay".  The only thing that would complete the picture were if Jace was wearing a straw hat and chewing on a strand of hay.  I couldn't help but laugh.  His sun glasses were propped up on his head and he hung his leather jacket over his shoulder.  He would stop men and ask "Not Gay?"  like he was oblivious to what he was saying.  And in his southern drawl it was clear others weren't exactly getting it either.

A small hand tugged on my ear buds that hung around my neck still.  I turned in the direction and Stella smiled back at me.  Damn she was short.  I grinned down at her.  She asked, "You know him?"

I chuckled to myself as I turned to watch the carosel for my things.  "I should claim that I don't.  But sadly I do."

She grinned at me, "Does he realize what his sign says?"

I grabbed my last bag thankful it made it through just fine, "He does.  It's an inside joke."  I offered Stella my hand, "I'm not gay."  

Stella giggled.  "You should go up and give him a big kiss."

I laughed, it took me a long while to finish laughing, she was a trip.  "Maybe I should."  Maybe I shouldn't.  But it would definately make a scene and that was truly what Jace was after.

I grinned at Stella.  "You asked for it."

I walked up to Jace with a knowing grin on my face.  He looked up at me with ease and I leaned in and kissed him softly on the lips.  He tasted like cinnamon gum.  It overrode his naturaly clean sent, like he'd been hung out to dry on the line.  I pulled back and glared at him and he grinned.  I took the gum out of my mouth with two fingers and offered it back to him and he laughed.  "Hi," I said with a faked breathless grin.

Jace laughed, "Hey lover."  

I rolled my eyes at him and waved Stella over.  "Jace, this is Stella and her son Aidan. That was her idea."

Jace turned to her and offered his hand, "Jason Hill at your service."  His southern drawl was completely gone when he introduced himself.  "You told him to kiss me?  How very daring of you?  Did you know he would really do it?"

Stella laughed, "He told me about his affliction."  She grinned up at me with a teasing smile.

"My affliction...."  I rolled my eyes.

Jace flicked my shoulder with his fingers, "That's a nasty habit.  Be nice to the lady.  Your affliction is contatious afterall."

I smacked Jace in the head, his sunglasses fell to the floor.  He glared at me as he picked them up.  "Stella, you need a lift?"

I refrained from sticking my tongue out at Jace as Stella nodded her head, "That would be wonderful I could catch a cab, but if you are going that way."

Jace grabbed her bags and smiled, "We are going anyway you need us to go.  He ain't in no hurry.  Are you lover?"

I rolled my eyes at him and Stella hit my arm this time.  "What was that for?" I asked shocked.

She smiled, "You rolled your eyes at him."

I stuck my tongue out at her and she smacked me again and I couldn't help but laugh, "He called me lover, he better stop or he's going to find a foot up his ass."

That got a pointed stare from Stella, "Watch your language."  It wasn't a joke.

Jace wrapped an arm around Stella, "Don't mind him.  He's a troubled youth.  He has no manners, and no couth.  Come on Darling, I'll get your bags and we'll take you where you are going."

Leave it to Jace to pick up the girl I was after.  I'd have glared at him if I'd cared really.  To be honest, Jace wouldn't go anywhere with her either, he was married now.  Mia had finally wrangled him into asking and she was pretty intense about his being faithful.

I followed the pair out the doors and listened to Jace bad mouth me some more, Stella looked back with a sheepish grin and I rolled my eyes.  She shook her finger at me and I gave her a dirty look, it was all in jest, I hoped.

I opened the door for Stella as Jace took her bags to the back of the black SUV he'd brought down.  Stella climbed in.  I shut the door after Stella got Aidan strapped into the carseat that seemed to be in the back.

I took my bags to the back of the SUV and Jace was waiting for me.  He grinned up at me, and mouthed, "Damn!"

I grinned back at him and leaned in and whispered, "She asked me out on a not a date."  I beamed at him.  Jace smiled back.  I spoke louder so Stella could hear me, "I see Mia lets you take Naya out and about."

Jace laughed, "She better with another one on the way."

I was impressed Jace had enough prestige now to own his own car, that was a rarity.  Jace smiled, "We live in Brooklyn, kinda need the space."

"Really.  Why the f..."  I paused in my thoughts and corrected my self, "Why would you want to do that?"

"Mia wants a house.  I gave her a house."  Jace confided.  "The woman gets what she wants."  He waved his left hand in front of my face like I didn't remember he'd gotten married.  

I grinned at him, "Seems like you got sucker punched."  I walked around to the passenger side of the car.  

Jace called out, "What you don't want to drive?"

I laughed, "Not on your life."

We both climbed into the SUV and Stella grinned at Jace in through the rear view mirror, "So the sign, tell me about it."

Jace laughed and I had to roll my eyes, Jace loved to tell stories.  He blurted out rather quickly, "We like guys."  He added automatically, "And girls.  I introduce Nox here to a few of my gay friends.  I'm the odd ball out till Nox joined the crew.  They'd ask, 'So you're gay?'"  Jace laughed, "He'd always say, I'm not gay."  Jace poked me in the shoulder and I turned to look out the window, I hated the story.  "He always adds, I like girls too or something to that affect.  Like he's defending his choices."

I sighed, "I defend every decision I make, in everything Jace."

Jace patted my arm, "I know.  You know I tease."  He turned to Stella with a smile, "He had a rough life.  I don't know why he tolerates me picking on him.  Anyone else and I'd be gagging on my tongue."  He grinned playfully, but in reality he wasn't really joking, I was known to stuff air in bullies mouths when they called me names.  I was young then, but the reputation stays with you.  I spent many days in detention for that.

Stella nodded, but I wasn't sure she understood what Jace had been getting at, and really it didn't matter.  Jace smiled at her, his boyish southern charm was not lost on her as she grinned back at him, "So where to madame?"

Stella scronged around in her purse for an address and handed Jace a peice of paper with her reservation on it.  Jace whistled as he showed me the paper, "That's near us, you aren't out of the way at all.  Shall we?"

Jace pulled out into the parking lot and headed towards the City proper.  I looked out the window and remembered my first time fondly.  I was glad to be on solid ground.  I was with Dorian, he smelled of vanilla and cinamon with a hint of pine and musk underneath.  It was comforting.  I hugged Mushu to my little body as Dorian drove me home.  He left me to my thoughts.  

As we drove through the streets of the skyscrapers I was in awe of them.  I wished I was Batman, or Spiderman.  But even then I was afraid of heights, more so than now and the thought terrified me.  The daydreams of a small boy filtered through my head as Stella and Jace chatted about things.

At a stop light Jace punched me in the arm, "Penny for your thoughts, man."

Stella added, "You've been quiet."

I grinned back, "Just thinking about the first time I took this route."

"Tramatic?"  Stella asked with a bit of pity tinging her voice. 

I hid my disgust behind a playful grin, I didn't need anyone's pity, "Hardly.  I was lost in thought most of the way.  It's the last good memory I have of Mushu."  I smiled fondly.

Aidan chirped, "Mushu - rarrrr"

I laughed, "Yes, little man, rarrr.  He was my favorite.  Sadly he burnt the next day."

Stella asked, "Burnt?"

Jace sighed, "There was a fire.  He doesn't like to talk about it.  Our roomate stole Mushu and in the ruckous it created a fire started and the little stuffed dragon became its only casualty."

I sighed as I looked out the window, "It was the first of many such instances."

"You mean losing your toys?"

We both laughed, but I answered her curious questions, "No, of being bullied."

Jace stopped the SUV in front of the Pennsylvania Hotel.  "Nice digs, I'd definitely work for them if they are putting you up here."

Stella laughed, "My mother said it was some fancy rich firm that needed help."  She started packing things up to prepare for her departure.  I got out of the vehicle and pulled her bags from the back.  

"Well maybe we'll just order in then.  I'll foot the bill, if you order for two and a half."  I called from behind.

She turned and beamed at me, her smiled lightened my heart.  "Still keeping me company tonight?"

I grinned, "But of course."  I closed the back door and waited on the sidewalk for Stella to walk over.

She stood in front of me and I russled the boy's hair and he swatted at my hands.  I grinned at him and Stella smiled at me.  "I'll call you later and we can set up a time."

She winked at me as she walked away.  This girl was more confusing than any other.  I don't know why I was seeing her again.  I really should back away before I make things impossible.

When I got back in Jace commented, "Damn!  You haven't even been home an hour yet and you've already got a date."

I rolled my eyes as Jace pulled out into traffic as we headed towards the compound and headed home.





# The Mission
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 an hour or two later_

Jace goaded me the last few blocks before he parked his SUV in the complex next to the compound.  The cavern of the parking garage was another old memory.  I rarely used the vehicles in the City, mostly I was too young, and really I hated to drive in the City, out in the world it was great, here it sucked.

I took my bags to the elevator and I could still remember the elated fear that coursed through my body as I waited with Dorian all those years ago.  The door dinged and whooshed open and we stepped into the glass elevator.  It wasn't quite so bad right now encased in concrete, but once we went up a few more floors things would get bad.  I took a deep breath and turned to watch the doors.  

Jace laughed, "Man, you'd think jumping from a skyscrapper would break that fear."

I shook my head and closed my eyes shut. I remembered pressing my face into Dorian's dress pants, his scent was a comfort then, even though I was having a panic attack.  I took a deep breath and turned around to stare into the lobby as we rose up into the Apex Unlimited building that was once again my home.  

I saw the statue I created standing proud and strong in the grand lobby.  I smiled and Jace punched me in the arm.  "See you can do it."

I hit him back this time, my arm was getting a nice bruise.  Jace was about to hit me back when the door dinged and I turned around to look as another person entered the plate glass elevator.  Jace grinned and I returned the gesture, we'd been caught, but it wasn't anything really.

Once we reached our destination I was assualted by a small brunette bearing files and folders and started dragging me to a conference room.  I looked helplessly at Jace and he shrugged, "I'll take these to your room, catch ya round Nox.  Good luck!"

I gave him a dirty look as Dae'lin shoved me into a glass conference room.  We called it the fish bowl, I hated this converence room, I hated everyone seeing through the walls.  I could smell the floral perfume Dae'lin wore, she swore at me, "Damn it, Nox.  Where have you been?"

She was a picture of fury, her raven hair all over the place as if she'd been running her figners through it, her eyes were screaming dark spikes at me.  I was barely with her, I didn't have any answers.  My body was still floating through the fear of the eleveator and Dae'lin wasn't making matters any better.

I leaned against the table looking down at the floor and tried to take slow steady breaths.  The door opened and I saw a pair of black leather shoes step into my view.  I followed the legs up and couldn't really help noticing how well his pants fit.  "Dae'lin, maybe you should introduce us before you scold him in front of me."  His voice was soft and masculine and it sent a shiver down my spine. 

I let myself finish looking at the man I that had guided me through my childhood.  His khaki's and button up shirt were pressed and starched, perfection at all times.  I reached his face and knew that his mustache and goatee would be perfectly groomed and shaped.  He was smiling at me with perfect sparkling blue eyes.  His hair was only slightly mussed like he'd just run his fingers through his hair too.  He held out his hand to me with a hint of embarassment in his cheeks.  He had noticed me checking him out. "Dorian Vega, and you are?"

I winked at him.  "You don't recognize me?" I grinned and took his hand firmly, "Nox Sétanta."  I hadn't seen the man in a least three years.  Apparently I wasn't as memorable to him as he was to me.  The look on his face said he was surprised to see me, and surprised to have me checking him out.  I turned in a hury to distract myself more than anything and walked around the conference table.  I sat down quickly and noticed Dorian had watched me walk around the table.  I wished I could interpret the emotions that I'd seen play on his face before they were hidden with a pleasant smile.  Was this going to be a problem?

Further away from the distractions I could see the patterns that evovled around Dorian. I saw distinct difference from the last time I'd seen the man.  Now that I thought about it, so had Jace.  Dae'lin had forever remained the same, the fire pulling so hard that it took over everything else in her fury.  

I could feel the pulse in my neck thrumming through my veins.  I do not recall Dorian being _that_ hot before.  Damn!  I shifted in my chair and looked at Dae'lin, "So nice of you to ask about my flight.  It went well.  I had a nice seat mate to keep my mind from playing games on me."  I fell into my normal mask without a problem, hiding everything that I could so that people had less to chastize me about.

Dorian chuckled and I forced myself not to look at him, but I could barely focus on what I was saying, "What's the problem, Dae'lin?"  I needed to concentrate, and Dorian was going to make that very difficult.  They both took a seat across from me and I could feel my heart racing. _Get it together!_ I chided myself.  I wasn't 15.

Dorian's smooth voice started describing the problem, "Someone is targeting the Venatori.  Two families specifically."  I quirked an eyebrown in question, it wasn't uncommon that we received hate mail and the like.  Yes vampires sending hate mail was common.  It was rather funny if you thought about it.  We were the things that bumped back against the things that went bump in the night.  We were the monsters to the monsters.  

Dorian continued, I was pretty sure he stopped speaking as my thoughts went elsewhere.  He knew me too well.  "Kai Videns youngest son was gifted a box that blew up in his face.  He is in critical condition in the Infirmary.  And just today my father has also received a package, but I notice it was emitting strange patterns, so I had it taken for investiagation."

There was only one question I had, "How are the bombs getting through the security in the mail room?"  

I already knew the answer, but Dae'lin responded her voice tight with exasperation at my inept question.  "We've gone through this with Kai.  The bombs are of all elements, formed at the same time the best we can figure.  There are very few who can see all four elements in the mail room.  Which is why you are here?"

"So you think it's a Cesari doing this?"

Dae'lin sighed, "No, Dorian does.  And he's the resident expert on all things Cesari.  I'll let him explain.  So far it's just the two families, and with Emilio and Kai working so close together it makes sense.  I... We don't expect other families to be targetted."

"I'll look through their cases see if I can find any connections."  I interjected.

Dae'lin sighed, "If you must.  Kai won't like you poking your nose around things, Nox.  He gave me a earful after your Ad Aetatem."

I sighed, I knew that would happen the moment he asked.  "Tough shit.  He can tell me to back off himself, and then I'll just keep looking anyway."

Dae'lin stood up and sighed, "I know.  The two of you will be the death of me.  Neither of you listen!"  She stalked out of the room, I grinned as her tight rear swayed out of the room.  I swallowed hard, when then hell did I let my hormones take over.  I stood up and walked around the table.

As I passed the seat Dorian sat in he stopped me with a hand against my chest holding a stack of folder files.  I could feel the warmth of his skin through my hoodie, I wished that I'd unzipped it.  I looked down at him with a grin and took the files from him, my fingers brushed against his as I could almost feel sparks.  My breath caught but thankfully Dorian spoke and I didn't have to ask what it was he was giving me.  "The information I have on Cesari for you to look through."

I nodded, I didn't trust my voice.  Dorian stood up his body brushed against mine before he took a small step back so he wasn't touching me, but I could still feel his presence in my bones.  "I examined the package my father had.  The craftsmanship is untrained, erratic.  They were too well put together to not have been done at the same time.  But the only person who has ever done those types of feats in my presense has been you."

I grinned at Dorian, "You think it might be me?"  I knew better than to think Dorian would think badly of my ability.  But I wanted to hear it from him.  

"I don't, no.  I wouldn't put it past your father, or mine to think of you as a suspect.  But you are the best candidate for the job, the patterns are there, if you can see them.  Maybe we can catch this bastard before he kills someone."  I don't think I've ever heard Dorian Vega swear.  His perfection was something that forbid such things, and yet he had.  Maybe a lot more had changed in the three years I was gone.

I moved towards the door brushing against Dorian's arm, "I'll look into it.  You know more about Cesari than anyone else has ever forgotten about them."  I smiled at him as I opened the door, "Anything else?"  I had hopes, but I knew they weren't for real, there was nothing I could offer him other than a good time.

He smiled and shook his head, my heart leapt at the sight of that smile.  I turned quickly and started in the direction of the adult residences.  Dae'lin called out my name from her office and I turned to look at her.  "Nox, we need to talk after you get settled."

I grinned at her, "You think I don't know what you want."  I could see the fiery woman blush, it was an attractive view.  My control was completely shattered and I had no idea why.  

Dae'lin hid behind her door before she shut it, "Either way find me.  We need to discuss it."

I sighed and nodded.  Dorian was watching the exchange and I shot him my best smile.  He returned it with a small smile of his own.  "See ya round."  I hope I did anyway.

Dorian nodded, "If you need to we can go over some of that later, after you've gotten things settled in."  My heart raced, _FUCK!_

The files were thick and I ran my fingers through the top corner and grinned, "I'm sure I'll need some help at some point."  I headed towards my room before my damn hormones got the better of me and I was acting like I was fifteen on the outside as well.






# Broken
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 around 5pm_

I rounded the corner with too many thoughts in my head.  Each one vying for top billing.  There was the mission at hand that was running through my head, how could one of our own target Venatori.  It was unheard of.  Venatori went rogue sure, but usually not against other Venatori.  And then there was Stella and the confusing signals she was sending - dinner and a kiss yet but not a date.  Maybe that was the reason I was eyeing everyone I'd had been close to growing up.  Was it the vast expanse of emptiness that triggered this?  I was really going to need to talk to Margo now.

I wasn't paying attention when I ran into a large frame that barely moved.  The voice that spouted, "What the fuck!  Watch where you are going!", registered just as the man recognized who I was.  I was looking into the dark pools of chocolate that were my father's eyes.  

With a quick and effortless motion I was pinned against the wall.  My heart jumped into my throat and I could feel the panic set in as my body relaxed out of reflex.  My father weilded his magic like an ogre, his speed and strength were his best weapons and he was using them against me with ease.  But I could see the anger in the patterns around him.  I could hardly breathe between the panic in my body and the pressure of his fist against my chest.

I croaked out "Kai".  

He spoke in a quiet voice, it was eirie and frightening, "I don't need your help son.  Go back where you came from.  I told Dae'lin I didn't need you snopping around here."

He continued to hold me against the wall and yet my panic didn't settle into compliance, his angry made me on edge.  I could barely breath, I focused air around my father and flung him across the hall to the other side of the wall.  I fell forward and I smiled at my father, I'm sure it was less than friendly, I could feel the years of bullshit I had endured here building up, I needed to leave before I took it out on the man who gave me life.

I walked away from my father and headed towards my temporary home.  When I got far enough away I released my father and prayed he didn't try to follow me.  I leaned against the wall and tried to catch my breath and let the feeling return to my hands, I hadn't realized were balled in a fist.  I hate this feeling.  I hated it with a passion.  I needed to let it go...

I need to break things.  Really break things, but that wasn't good for me either.  Margo suggests I workout, or to go for a run, so that's what I would do, but I'd do it my way - and break things.  I started towards my room as my phone rang.  I stopped and grabbed it from my pocket it was an unknown number.  I answered, "Yeah?"

A sweet voice swept over the line, "Hey Nox.  You figure out your plans?"

I sighed, I wasn't in the mood and I wasn't sure I would be good company.  "Hey Stella.  I can try to make it over in a few hours."  I said I'd go, so I'll try to make it.  "I will call if I can't make it."

Stella laughed, "Fine be like that.  Go hang with Jason and leave me."

I grinned, "Jace went home to his wife.  I have something I need to do and then I'll be over.  But I sometimes lose track of time."

Stella smiled, "Sure, sure.  I'll see you in a few hours.  I have to go Aiden is crawling up the fridge."

"Alright, I'll see you then."  I hung up the phone feeling a little better.  But not great.  I unlocked the door to my room and walked in.  

The room was bland.  Even blander than my room in the dorms.  It was beige in every direction.  The carpet, the walls. The celing was the only thing that was white.  It was small but it was quaint.  

There was a full size bed off to the side, a table and two chairs in the middle of the room, a small kitchenette to the left, a door that had to be the bathroom to the right.  A small couch, and a TV hung on the far wall.  It was cozy.  But it was mine for now.  It would do, I would likey be on my way again after Mark found I was in town.

I saw my bags sitting on the bed where Jace left them, a note sat on top of my laptop bag.  "Hey babe, Glad you are back.  Will stop by for breakfast - Jace"

Jace was still calling me endearments, which meant that people still made comments about it.  The rumors the last few years had us sleeping together and much worse.  None of it was true, at least not completely true, we hadn't actually slept together in the sexual sense, we'd shared beds for sleep and with other women or men between us.  But we personally never actually did more than share a touch or a kiss here and there.  

Our friendship was important to us both and we didn't want to ruin it with sex.  Neither of us at the time were looking for that perfect someone.  Jace had of course already found her, he and Mia had been on again, off again for years.

I grabbed my laptop and the files Dorian gave me and started wandering the halls of the compound looking for the right place.  I headed back towards the classrooms and found one of the fire starter training rooms.  I stopped in front of the orange door and my heart speed up.  Behind one of those doors my nightmares started.

I watched helplessly as the memories came back while I was awake.  Each movement I made mimic ones I'd dreamt about every day for most of life.  I opened the door, I felt like the five year old I had been.  So naive and unafraid.  I could see Master Garrett standing in the middle of the room waiting for me.  He looked kind.  He could be trusted I was told.  Everyone said he would help me control the fire.  

I shut the door behind me.  He'd smile at me.  The first day he tried to make me spark, tried to get me to start a fire uncontrolled.  He tried everything.  He tickeled me.  I squirmed at his touch.  I didn't spark.  He tried to make me sad, and he made me angry, and then without any warning, his hand flew across the front of his body and the back of his hand made contact with my cheek.  I could feel the bruise blooming.  I sparked, and I cried.  I was lost in my tears as he comforted me and that was the end of that session.

The next day I came back and he smiled again.  He told me what was to follow was for my own good - to teach me.  He took no pleasure in it.  He weilded air, I could see the flailing pattern around him as he told me to take off my shirt.  I didn't obey, I was afraid.  I felt the fear course through me like it was that day.  He pushed me up against the wall and hit me with his fist, "Listen boy, Do as I say or this will go badly."  

He was no longer kind.  I remembered thinking what had I done to make him so mad.  I scrambled out of my shirt and listened flawlessly the remainder of the session as he brought the strings of air across my back.  He muffled my cries when I started sobbing.  

Every day since then ran through my mind.  The strength and change in his demeanor, my willingness to give up the moment I walked in the door.  The fear...

A hand touched my shoulder and I jumped, a pained cry escaped my lips before I regained control of my body and pushed the fears away.  I looked in the direction I had been touched and I saw peace.  It wasn't my hormones speaking this time, I could smell the safety of home on Dorian.  I could see the calm concern in his blue eyes.  He'd moved away from me the moment I cried out but he stayed and watched me.

I turned my back on him as I wiped away the tears that fell on to my cheeks.  I wove a ball of air and fire into a perfect pattern and hurled it across the room and watched the pattern scatter into a billion bits and peices as the ball shattered on the wall.

I threw another and another until the tears stopped falling.  I could feel Dorian's eyes on me.  I chocked out through fireballs, "Can I help you?"

Dorian didn't say anything as I heard him pull a chair over and sit down to my left, not too close, but close enough he didn't have to shout to respond to me.  "I saw you standing outside, you looked lost."

I took a deep breath and gathered my strength, "I'm not lost.  Just haunting memories."

"I can tell.  Do you want to talk about it?"  The concern in his voice, the patience I grew up with reverberated in everything he said to me.  My heart fell as the fear tried to take over.

I shook my head, "If I talk about it, it'll get worse."

"Whatever it is does Dr. Silverman know?"  Dorian asked.  I shook my head.  "You need to talk to someone, it's clearly upsetting you."

I shook my head again.  "I came here because of my father."

Dorian chuckled softly, "I saw that as well.  I swear I'm not following you."  His voice went back to the calm demeanor that meant I was safe.  "Your father upsets you?  This upsets you?  I see now why your standing appointment remains."

I turned to Dorian, I couldn't imagine the sight I was, my eyes were probably puffy and red, tear stains streaking my cheeks.  I was holding a fireball above my hand, the orange glow dancing in both of our eyes.  I gave Dorian a fake smile, "Are you still watching over me?"

Dorian smiled reassuring, it was soft and it did the job.  I could feel the childhood safety of his office.  Everything I said there was between us - and his records.  He recorded everything.  "You are cesari." He said.

That one statement alone made my heart sink.  He followed me because I was his niche - nothing more.  I frowned and turned around and threw a few more fireballs.  As I formed another I heard Dorian stand up, I saw him out of the corner of my eye as he stood next to me.  "I care what happens to you, Nox.  As every other child here.  I continue to keep tabs on you because you are cesari.  It does not change the fact that I care."

I threw the fireball and wove another pattern.  Dorian continued, "I will tell you what I think this is then.  I think the orange door reminded you of what Garrett did to you behind the veil here."

My world crashed around me. My breathing stopped, my heart speed up if that were even possible, it had already been cantering at high speed with the fear that coursed through my body.  The fireball I'd been creating fizzled in my hand.

Dorian put his hand on my shoulder, "Breathe, Nox."  

As if it were a command I took a gasping breath and fell to my knees.  "What do you know?" I whispered, I could barely hear it but it sounded like thunder in my ears.

Dorian sat down on the concrete floor to my left, just out of reach, he was being careful, but he was concerned, I could see the patterns shifting around him, this was upsetting him as much as it was me.  He put his hands on his knees, "I don't KNOW anything.  I suspect a great many things.  Garrett did something to you, and you set him on fire.  That is all I know.  But I know you wouldn't do that without provoking, it was no accident I know that much."

I felt five again.  My body hurt, I could feel the lashes across my back, I wanted to curl up into a little ball and die.  It had been a very long time since I'd felt like this.  I fell backwards to sit on the cold concrete instead of kneel.  I pulled my knees up to my chest and hung my head against them.  I could feel the fear and the pain again.  I'd moved past this.  It was a waking nightmare.  I hadn't had one in years.  I whispered, "He beat me."

I heard a hitch in Dorian's breath that indicated that was what he suspected.  He didn't react like I expected, he didn't move to hug me, try to comfort me, he didn't take pity on the grown man curled up in the fetus position crying.  He spoke calmly and softly and I could feel the tension leaving my body, "I moved you from his tutelage because I suspected.  I've watched him since.  I cannot pin anything on him.  All recordings of you were veiled."

I sat there listening to my breathing, and to Dorian's.  We sat there for a good while, thankfully I'd stopped crying.  I straigthened my back and I put on a grin.  "Was there something I could help you with?"

Dorian's smile was strained, he was putting on a good face as he shook his head.  "I had just come from seeing a new student's test when I saw you standing in front of this room.  You looked lost."

My lip curled in a half smile, "You said that already."  I stood up and took a deep breath.  "I'd rather anyone else not know."

Dorian nodded, "I will tell no one, you know this."  Dorian reached a hand to my arm and smiled at me, "You had a date, yes?"

I laughed, it felt hollow but it was there, I could feel it bubbling inside, knew it was good to move on, move past the depression that always followed the waking nightmare.  "She said it's not a date.  Though I doubt I'll be good company."

Dorian took a cautious step closer and put his other hand on my arm, "Go.  Forget about here.  Forget about what happened, be young.  I will make sure Dae'lin gives you some time.  I can't promise much, but I can promise some."

I shook my head, "You don't have to."

Dorian grinned, "Yes I do.  Go, Nox.  Free these memories. Speak with Margo tomorrow, tell her about it.  Please?  I think it'll help."  Dorian grabbed my things, he smiled as he noticed the papers were his.  "I will take these to your room.  You go.  I'm sure being early won't be bad."

I nodded and Dorian waited for me to walk out the door.  I grinned at him and brushed my lips against his cheek and whispered, "Thank you."  He smelled like he always did, of cinamon and vanilla.  I could get lost in that scent.  I wanted to.  The happy thoughts carried me out the door of the fire starter training room.

# Bigger Distractions
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 6:30 PM_

The walk to the hotel only helped my mood slightly.  It was good to finally walk somewhere instead of having to drive everywhere.  I passed two pizza places and a few Starbucks.  I stopped in at a Starbucks on the corner and grabbed a Tall Caramel Cocoa Cluster Frappuccino with coconut milk and no whipcream.  God, I missed this!

I sipped at my coffee as I walked into Pennsylvania Hotel and stopped at reception.  I probably should have changed, my 'Wanna screw?' t-shirt was hardly appropriate.  I pulled the zipper on my hoodie up to cover the image.  At least I could do that.  I hoped it wasn't hot up in Stella's room.

The woman at the front desk looked bored, she stared at her screen twirling her long straight brown hair.  She needed to pull it away from her face and neck, a pair of dangling earrings would look good against her long neck.  I sighed, seriously needed to get laid...

I smiled at the woman, her name was Elaine.  "I'm here to see Stella.  I didn't ask her last name, she's a toddler with her."  I pulled out my phone and looked for Stella's last call.  "She's in room 405?"

Elaine smiled at me, her teeth were yellowed from smoking more than likely I tried not to roll my eyes.  "Ms. Row said someone might be stopping by.  She said to send you up."  The woman nodded to me and pointed to a row of elevators, "You can take those up and you'll be almost there."  She looked down at some notes on her desk.  "Are you Nox?  You look like he described."

I laughed softly, "I was described how?"

She blushed, it was endearing.  "Tall, wearing a navy blue hoodie, blue jeans and a pair of worn Nike's - likely covering his offensive t-shirt."

I couldn't help laughing out loud.  I got shushed from a woman with a pettite little dog under her arm.  I smiled as I unzipped my hoodie and showed her the saying, she blushed again.  My smile grew wider as I put my elbow on the desk.  "Yes I'm Nox.  What did you need Duckling?"  I used my most seductive voice and was rewarded with a blush and a figdet from her hands.  

But she recovered quickly.  "Your friend called, said to bring this up with you."  She handed me a chilled bottle of wine.  Dorian... "It's paid for."  I grinned, of course it was.

"Thanks Elaine.  When he calls back, and I know he will, tell him exactly this, 'Thanks love, would rather drink with you.'"  I winked at her, let her figure that one out.  I headed towards the elevator that I was told to and sipped at my coffee as I tried not to think about the elevator.  I had plenty of other things to occupy my mind.  Dorian was trying to get me laid, I must be really bad if the proud and proper Scrin was trying to insure I had a good time on my not a date.  I had a perfectly good human girl waiting on me and I couldn't get that man out of my head.  He was almost as confusing as Stella was.

I knocked on room 405 and I heart "Shit!" called out from the otherside of the door.  I was chuckling to myself when Stella opened the door with a plush white tower wrapping her red locks and another wrapped around her chest.  My eyes wandered down she wasn't wearing much underneath the towerl either.  I let my gaze rise slowly and grinned at her.  I wanted to her to know I approved but I wouldn't take another peek, or at least I'd try not to.  

She laughed, "At least you aren't trying to hide it."  She opened the door wider, "Come on in, let me get dressed."

I walked in to her posh room.  It was hardwood floors, the bedding was already rumbled in her single queen size bed, there was a couch and a table, and the playpen in the middle of the floor held a sleeping baby.  I walked back towards the bathroom and leaned against the adjoining wall.  I could have stood in the doorway she'd left open but I'd behave myself on this not-a-date.

I grinned happily, "You didn't have to shower for me."

Stella laughed, it was infectious and my smile grew.  "If I told you it wasn't because you were coming over I'd be lying, but I showered a few hours ago.  Aidan has been a royal terror since we got in."

I chuckled softly, "We'll at least he's sleeping now."

She poked her head out the door, her hair was still wet but she wore a green camasole and a pair of black jeans.  I could see the straps of her panties over the top of her hip huggers and grinned to myself.  She smiled at me as she snuck back into the bathroom, "Thank god.  I really didn't know what I was going to do with him."

"He would have been fine.  I'm not breakable."  I teased.

She laughed, "He can bench press his truck now.  Did you get things straightened out?"

I shook my head but I knew she couldn't see, "No.  My day got worse too."

Stella came out with a black see through wrap over her green camasole but that was the only other change to her attire that I could notice since she poked her head out before.  She had taken the time to put on a little make up and I felt slightly underdressed now.  

She plucked the bottle of wine from my hand.  "Wine and coffee?"

I laughed softly as we walked into the other room.  "I bought the coffee on the way over.  My friend called and ordered the wine."

"Jason?" she asked with a flip in her voice, like she expected there to be more to us than meets the eye.

I laughed, "No, like I said he went home to his wife.  Just another friend, who knew you'd like wine."

She grined at me, "At least he understands women better than you."

"You have no idea, Stella."

Stella frowned, "Don't tell me he's gay?"

I nodded with a smile, "He is."  I handed her two plastic cups from near the ice container.  "The best I can offer."

Stella took them and poured two glasses of wine and took a big swig of it before she refilled hers.  How easy it would be to get her in bed.  I pushed the thought away as quickly as it came as I took a sip of the wine.  She commented, "Good vintage."

I smiled, "If you say so.  I'm more a beer guy."

"That doesn't surprise me.  Food should be here soon."  Stella walked closer to me and smiled up at me.  I swallowed hard she was making me want to do bad things to her just by standing near her.

"Your friend.  You like him?"  She was ever inquisitive about my life.

"You sure are curious about me."  She smiled up at me and I sighed, "Yes.  I like him.  He's far more attractive than I remember."  Not to mention the fact that Dorian just has something about him right now that pulls me towards him, but I didn't say that.

She sighed with releif and I knew what was coming next, "I want to set the stage right now before you get the wrong idea."

I closed the distance between us and put my finger to her lips to quiet her.  "You don't have to say it.  I know the words already.  You want to be friends.  It's not you, it's me."  I grinned at her and she looked like I'd hurt her, I stepped away.  "It's alright, I really didn't come her looking to get laid.  Disappointed a little, if you hadn't traveled with Aidan I would have tried, but I'm not _that_ guy."

She still looked hurt, "You hear that a lot?  Why did you come then?"

I took a deep breath, "I was encouraged by my friend to clear my head.  And no, I don't hear that a lot.  I don't hit on people who would generally say no."

She frowned, "So you weren't hitting on me?"

I shurgged, "I was, I didn't expect to see you again.  It was safe.  I didn't think you'd like some punk kid."

"You aren't a punk kid."  She put her hand against my cheek and I pulled it way.

"I am.  You just don't know me."  I stepped away, "I should go, this was a bad idea."

Stella caught my arms and I froze, the painful memories started to come to the surface and I stamped them down with a large hammer.  She moved around to look up at me, "You don't have to.  We can be friends."

I rolled my eyes, "I'm not that gay friend every girl has."  I pulled my arm from her.

Stella laughed but it was strained, "No, but you know New York better than I do.  If I get the job you'll be the only person I know. Please don't go like this."

A knock came and Stella smiled, "And besides the food is here now, there is no point in it going to waste.  If you want to go when we are finished that's okay."

I nodded, "Alright."

The bell hop pushed the cart into the room and lifted the lid.  I smiled burgers and fries.  Stella smiled shyly, "I figured everyone likes burgers."

"Not wrong there."  I tipped the bell hop and set the lids to the side and pulled the cart close to the couch.  I took a bite and found it passable.  I could do better.  But I kept my thoughts to myself.  Stella had thought I'd come to take advantage of her.  She dressed to kill and she turned me down, my self esteem was just plumetting.  I really needed to just go home, throw a few more fireballs or punch the bag.  I could call Margo.

"Tell me about your friend?"  Stella inquired, more questions about me.

I sighed, "I'd rather not talk about it."  I felt like crap, it was showing through my normal upbeat exterior, I needed to go home.

Stella frowned, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..."

I shook my head, "It wasn't you, my day has gotten shittier and shittier since I woke up."

"Do you want to talk about it?"  

I laughed, "Why does everyone think I want to talk about things?  Thanks but no.  I've an appointment with my shrink tomorrow, I'll talk then.  I should go."

Stella frowned, "You didn't finish."

I shrugged as I stood up, "I lost my appetite.  I'm sorry.  Call me tomorrow, I'll be in a better mood.  Let me know how the inteview went."

She was looking down at the plate, she was frowning, "I'm surprised you care."

I frowned, "I'm having a bad day.  I care if you get the job, I am just not good company.  I'm sorry."

I headed for the door and I could hear Stella make some sort of sound.  I turned around and I saw a tear sliding down her cheek.  "I'm sorry.  Please, call me tomrrow.  But I'll understand if you don't."

Stella frowned, "I'm sorry this didn't go as planned.  I..."

I smiled at Stella and walked back to her and knelt down in front of her, "Shhh.  It's okay.  I'm not the kinda guy you want to get to know, Stella.  I've not had a solid relationship in... ever.  And you know more about me than most people I've slept with already. You don't want to know me."

She punched me in the shoulder, she looked like she wanted to yell.  I could feel the panic rising inside and I put on a grin.  I fought to keep my calm around me, to stay in my happy place.  "You are a shit you know that.  You can't say one nice thing about yourself, it's no wonder you've never had a relationship, just meaningless sex."

I shrugged and stood up, she had me pegged already and I smiled.  "I'm okay with that."

Stella frowned, "Get out...."  She turned away from me and I sighed.  "Please."

I did as she asked.  I dropped some cash on the cart and hoped it was enough to cover the whole bill.  As I walked out the door my phone buzzed.  I shut the door and once I stepped into the elevator I looked at my phone, Dorian sent me a text, 'She's getting antsy, you should come back soon.'

I sighed of course I wasn't going to get to calm down.  I typed Dorian a message, 'On my way.  Thanks for the wine.  Got shot down before I got in the door.'

The elevator dinged and I stepped out into the lobby and started my walk back to the compound.





# Procreation
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 7:15 PM_

I stopped at the same Starbucks on the way home and grabbed the same thing.  I didn't expect to be sleeping the way I felt, so the coffee wasn't going to hurt that any.  I took the stairs.  I didn't feel like adding more to my already full plate.  My father, my dreams, Stella.  The only good thing that happened was finding out I liked Dorian, and that wasn't looking great either.  So my mood was shot when I walked into the main office area.

A crowd of people were standing in front of the stair well their backs were to me.  A familiar face turned and saw me and slipped away from the mass of questions and answers that I couldn't begin to understand with everyone talking at one another.

Dorian's bright smile and blue eyes faded the moment he saw me.  I had to look bad.  He put his arm around my shoulders.  "You should go before they see you.  You'll just get put to work."

I shook my head, "Work is fine."  I smiled at him, "Thanks though."

Dorian nodded and I slipped out from under his comforting arm and walked to the edge of the crowd.  They were all asking questions, and Dae'lin was doing her best to control things.  My father rounded a corner and he took charge.  "Everyone.  Just go.  We've got it under control."

The crowd looked at him and dispersed, it was kinda funny really.  It left Dae'lin standing exasperated until she saw me and then her fury rose.  I could feel the temperature in the room rise.  Kai looked at her and frowned, "Dae'lin, just stop.  We don't need your boy toy here to look at it, we can figure it out."

Boy toy.  Is that what he thought I was.  I'm glad he thinks so little of me.  I frowned, but I asked, "Look at what?"

Dae'lin frowned, "A package your father got.  I want you to look at it.  His so-called experts let the other one blow up."

I started to ask something but Dorian intercepted my question, "No one was hurt.  They had it contained." He turned to Kai, "Let him look, it's not going to hurt anything."

Kai sighed and nodded, "Fine.  I want to watch."

Dae'lin lead the way towards the testing rooms, at least it wasn't a fire starter room I don't think I could have done that again today, and definately not with someone watching me.  Though had I known Dorian was around I probably would have moved on instead of tried that.

Dorian walked next to me, he kept glancing at me, I assured him, "I'll be okay."

He nodded, "As you say."  He still shot me glances but I did my best to ignore the questions that ran through my head.  Kai and Dae'lin lead the way.  Dorian and Kai went in and Dae'lin caught my arm before I could go in.  "Where were you?"

I laughed, "Does it matter?  I'm here."

She sighed, "Yes, it matters.  Jason told me you had a date."

"So?  It's not any of your business."

"You know damn well it is my business."  Dae'lin shouted at me.

My hackels rose and I took a step back.  "It is no concern who I sleep with until I sign that damn paper Dae'lin.  I have neither agree nor denied your request."

Dae'lin's anger rose, "So you did sleep with her?"  The patterns around her rose higher and higher I could feel the temperature rise, I could almost see the fire burning around her.

I wrapped Dae'lin in water and watched her spit and sputter at me.  "It is none of your business whether or not I slept with her."  I walked into the testing room where Dorian and Kai were trying to ignore our arguement.

Dae'lin opened the door still dripping wet, "That was uncalled for!"

I turned around and saw the damage the water had done, her shirt was plastered to her body and showed off every curve.  I smiled at her and she ignored my looking at her.  "You need to do this Nox."

I laughed, "I don't **need** to do anything with you.  You are the best genetic match to creating a Cesari.  You are nothing more than an incubator for the Venatori.  We do their bidding why?  I can find someone I actually like Dae'lin."

She huffed and air wrapped me up and threw me against the wall.  I could feel the panic trying to rise, the sense of self preservation leeching from my body but I grinned at Dae'lin.  "Keep it up Dae'lin or you'll be moved to the back of the line.  I do not **need** to sleep with you, or procreate with you.  You need me, not the other way around.  My life is fine just the way it is."

Dorian stood up and walked in front of Dae'lin.  "We got this, why don't you go find something dry to wear."

Dae'lin glared at him and let the patterns of air drop that were holding me to the wall.  She left saying, "Ever the diplomat, aren't you Dorian?"

He didn't say anything only indicate that I take a chair.  I looked at the brown package on the table.  Kai was standing in a corner, as far from the package as he could get yet still be in the room.  Dorian sat next to me hunched over looking.

I smiled, it was good to be trusted.  I wove a ball of air around the package.  "Do we have any data on the one that your experts blew up?"  I looked up at Kai.

He shrugged, Dorian pushed the papers towards me.  He nodded.  I smiled, "Can you tell me the blast radius?"  I knew Dorian would know the stats I wanted without having to rummage through the report.

Kai hurmphed in the corner and I just continued to look at Dorian while he did the search in his photographic memory.  To have that would be nice and such a pain in the ass.  

Dorian grabbed the paperwork and flipped to a page and set the report back down so I could read at my leisure.  "About 6 feet in diameter."

"So 3 feet radius?"  Dorian gave me a lopsided grin, "Look at the picture I drew."

"Okay."  I looked at the page Dorian had flipped over and saw why he'd been hesitant to give me a complete answer.  "A focus'd blast.  That's impressive."  I started making adjustments to my shield and looked up at my father standing in the corner.  "Can you come on this side, please?  I would rather exert the forces needed in a smaller scale than around the whole thing."

Kai asked, "What are you doing?"  But he moved as I'd asked and pulled up a chair on the other side of me.  

"Keeping us from blowing up right now.  Making a shield of air and earth that should keep the blast contained."  If it blew up in the same general direction all around it would have been easier, but I didn't know which way the focus would be.  And I didn't want to examine too close before having adequate protection.

I took a deep breath and looked past the shield in order to see the patterns around the box.  "You don't know who delivered the box."  

It wasn't a question but Kai answered anyway, "That's correct.  We dusted for finger prints but found none."

"And you didn't try to open it so that's good."  I commented without thinking about how Kai might take it.

Dorian interjected before Kai could get angry, "Your father is a smart man.  He wouldn't step in the viper pit if he knew it was there."

I grinned, "The vipers would probably just run away anyway."

Kai gave a curt laugh and I could see the smile on his face.  Dorian chuckled softly then prompted me, "What do you see?"

"All kinds of weird shit.  The patterns shouldn't eminate from a box like this.  Bomb or no bomb.  It's like water, it's moving.  Stable patterns don't move.  Unless it's meant to, this isn't meant to.  It's almost like the person can't see the pattern.  The structure is missing, but the peices are all here.  Kinda like geletain without a mold.  What do you see, oh master of patterns?"  I turned to wink at Dorian.

Dorian shook his head.  "I'm not a master of patterns.  I can see each element.  I see complexities I've never seen.  I don't see the movment you suggest though."

"Look a little harder and you'll see it.  Think like a magnifying glass in your head.  Zoom in to see greater detail."

Dorian looked at me with his head tilted to the side, like a puppy does when it can't understand what you are doing.  It was endearing.  He shook his head to clear his own thoughts and turned to look at the pattern, I watched Dorian.  We sat in silence, I glanced at Kai, he seemed to be trying as well.  I turned and saw the recognition on Dorian's face before he exclaimed, 'Holy. Mother...."

I laughed, "See told ya."

"I'm going to start poking at the bomb, do you want to be in here?"

Dorian pulled the chair closer and I smiled, "Suit yourself."  

I looked to my father he shrugged, "I'm already here."

The patterns were everywhere, I poked at it with air.  It was maleable yet resistant to my pushing.  The patterns weren't going to unravel at the faintest touch, that was good.  I'd have hated to have it blow up in my face.

Dorian spoke in his instructor voice, I wondered if he did it on purpose, "Tell me what you are doing or tyring to do."

"I'm trying to see if there are any pressure points on the box itself.  Opening it clearly is a trigger, just wondering if there is something more.  I'm watching how the patterns react as I poke them in different places in the pattern.  Seeing if it'll unravel."

I turned to look at my father, he was intently watching but he looked bewildered, "What do you see?"

"I see only what I can manipulate."

I nodded, "Earth and Fire, right?"  It didn't matter what Kai answered I knew the answer already, I contuned. "Water is hard to see.  Think in colors.  Red for fire, brown for earth.  Blue is water, Green or yellow can be air.  Try looking for the other colors."

I started drawing with fire the patterns Kai couldn't see of water and air.  "This is vaguely what the air pattern looks like."

Kai sat back in his chair astonishment written alover his face.  "How do you get past the bubble of air?  Now that I can see air that's all I see."

I grinned but Dorian was the one to answer.  "It just takes practice.  Focus past it, like you are taking a picture of something just the other side of it."

I watched my father as he tried, I could see the sweat beading on his forehead and the concentration in his eyes.  He sat back in his chair with a look of defeat.   "It's alright, that's pretty good for your first time seeing air."  I smiled at him reassuring, it would have been a lot harder.

I went back to the box and traced the patterns with fire, mostly for Kai but it helped me put things in perspective.  I talked my way through how the peices fell together, how one connected to another, how it was unstable.  I didn't want to pull at the pattern.  So I started enhancing it, stabalizing it.  I wanted to see what it would look like without the weaknesses it had.

We sat in near silence for the better part of an hour where I puzzled through the pattern.  I smiled at the masterpeice.  It really was beautiful.  The completed patterns together to form this explosive peice of work.  I pulled at very specific points in the patterns and the patterns disappainted into nothingness.  Completely gone and unharmed.

Kai stood up and I dropped my shield and he opened the box slowly almost like he didn't trust me.  I wouldn't trust me either if I were him.  Inside the boxs there as a typed message  "Boom!  I hope your family liked my little surprise -A"

No one touched the paper.  Maybe there would be some information to be found inside the box.  Things that should have been destroyed.  Kai smiled, "Forensics will take care of this now."

I nodded, "Alright.  I'm going to go look for connections.  I have some thoughts."  I'd felt better than I had when I came in.  Working had been good.  I left Dorian and Kai chatting about their next move, mostly forensic stuff.  Stuff I couldn't be helpful with, so I left with a nod to my father and I brushed my fingers against the back of Dorian's hand.  He smiled and nodded farewell as he continued his conversation with Kai.  I felt better definitely.

# No Sleep
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 8:45 PM_

I needed to blow off steam.  Working had helped but the first moment my mind was left alone everything started trying to get my attention.  Things had not gone well with Stella, not that it really mattered, I was less likely to see her again than anyone else that was plaguing my mind.

I tried to focus on the task at hand, but it was difficult as I took the stairs to my room two at a time as fast as I could.  I eventually just focused on the stairs and my upward ascent.  I was barely winded when I reached the right floor, but I felt better.  

I opened the door to my bland room and grabbed my laptop that Dorian had safely set on the table with the papers he'd given me.  I let them drop on to bed, they bounced softly and sank into the comforter and mattress, that was a good sign anyway, it wasn't rock hard.

My bags were still on my bed and I moved them carefully to the floor so that I could use the bed to work comofortably.  I pushed the laptop up by the pillows and found a plug so my battery didn't die in the middle of things.  It was annoying getting the battery low message.

I set the papers down next to the laptop and laid down on my stomach and typed in to the database search feature of the Venatori records "Vega + Viddens".  I had no idea what it might bring up.  But it was my theory that there was a connection to something the two of them worked on. It was personal, the letter inside confirmed that suspicion.

There was nothing more to do than sit and wait for things to run through the search parameters and I didn't really need to be here for that.  I rolled over onto my back and thumbed through the files Dorian had given me.  It was a good portion of information that he'd collected on Cesari in general, me specifically, some stuff on Mark Green and the other resident cesari.  There seemed to be alot of statistics, stastics I already knew.

When I was in my early teens I had thought if I knew things about myself in terms of numbers and facts I might have a better understanding of things.  All it did was prove to me that I was different.  My birth alone was infintismally small.  The fact that I was cesari only slightly bigger than that.  My strength in the elements only slightly higher than that.  Put everything together and I was improbable, not impossible because here I sat alive and kicking.  Though sometimes I wondered if I was impossible.

Dorian also gave me a few odd cases of other Venatori who had gone rogue.  They had nothing to do with Kai or his father, but they were interesting reads.  But not interesting enough to keep my full attention.  I dozed and my computer dinged as the search finished and I was roused.

I rolled over on to my stomach again heedless of the papers that crumbled underneath me.  I assume they were my copies, Dorian was not one to give me originals or the only copy.  Dae'lin either for that matter - it was always copies, the originals weren't actually orginals either, as they were printouts of what was digitally entered.

The search results were anything and everything with mention of Kai and Emilio.  At the top were old entries from the headmasters and teachers during Kai's and Emilio's youth.  While they were not relatvant I hadn't expected to see them.   Dae'lin must have upped my security clearance.  I poked around those files for a little while.  

I found my father was a trouble maker.  Emilio was the peace keeper it seemed - always caught with Kai but always trying to stop things before they went too far.  Sounded like me and Jace.  Kai was also a firestarter and he spent a lot more time in confinement than I had. 

While I had only started one fire in my room. Kia had started five before he was released into general population.   The more I read about my father the more I found similarities between the way we grew up, and the more I found the differences too.   For everything we had in common there was a defined difference in things.  Kai was not disliked from what I could tell.  He was a perfect Venatori.  

Me, my sexual preferences were the least of my issues. If it were not for Jace I'd probably had it bad off if I survived at all.  Between the bullying and my own self-esteem issues I'm lucky I hadn't tried to kill myself.  But offing myself was not really ever an option, I liked myself too much.  I really don't care what others think of me.  They matter very little in the whole scheme of things.

I pulled myself out of Kai's life and our similarities and differences and back into the case.  I scanned for any mission that might stand out.  Something that would fit the profile Dorian had created for the perpentrator, if they were cesari and untrained. There was nothing in those files that pointed to anyone inparticular. 

There were two exile cases that I set aside to take a look at later.  I yawned and rubbed at my eyes, I could feel sleep on the edge and I hadn't slept well in ages.  The bed was at least comfortable, and I let myself drift into nothingness.







# Best Friends
_Monday, June 15, 2015 7:30AM_

The sounds of my dreamscape changed from the snap of air and earth against my skin to pounding.  As the last blow was about to strike I started awake panting and sweating with someone beating on the door to my room.  My shirt was damp with sweat.  I groggily yelled, "In a second." 

I'd fallen asleep staring at the screen, my head hurt, my back ached and I felt even worse than I had before falling asleep.  I pulled myself from the bed and checked the time on my phone.  I was surprised to find the time later than I thought, I had apparently swipped my 4am wake up call and fell back asleep.  The bed had been too comfortable after sleeping on the ground for weeks.

I eventually made my way to the door and opened it slowly.  I peeked out the door and saw a grinning face beaming at me and then slowly frown, "Shit man!"  Jace pushed his way through the door.  "You look like shit.  Nightmares still?"

I nodded my head as I shut the door behind him.  I squeezed my eyes shut as he flipped on the light and started making coffee.  I smiled, he knew me too well.

Jace turned from the now brewing coffee, "Go grab a shower.  Coffee will be ready and then we can go get breakfast."

I nodded again and blew Jace a kiss in thanks.  He swatted it away as he always did and grinned madly at me.  I grabbed a pair of boxers and headed in to the bathroom, hoping there were towels of decent quailty in there.

I was rewarded with white plush hotelesque towels and was thankful for the decency of the compound facilities, so much better than some hotels.  They smelled of fresh laundry if only a little stale from being cooped up so long.  If I stuck around I would be able to decorate a permanant room, this one was bland for a reason, so it didn't offend anyone.  Blandness apparently was the least offensive of the possiblities.

The shower pressure was awesome and the water was hot.  I could feel the aches leaving as the water scalded my skin.  I felt dirty even though I'd not done anything majorly dirty.  I always did after my nightmares.  I truly would have felt better if I'd gotten my morning workout in but such was life.  Today I'd have to survive on coffee and a shower.

I finsihed up pulling my boxers on and walking out of the bathroom into a very cold room, I hadn't realized the air was down so low.

Jace gave a polite whistle and I grinned as I pulled out an ordinary t-shirt - just a little faded red, no sayings.  Least offensive today sounded good.  A black pair of jeans and my black hoodie would round out things with my Nikes.  

I tied the laces on my last shoe as Jace brought me a cup of coffee.  "Like old times."

I grined up at him and took the warm cup in my hands and drank a scalding swallow, "At least you didn't burn it this time."

Jace laughed.  "I missed you too.  Stick around this time alright?  I don't know if I can be a dad without my friend to keep my grounded."

"You will be great Jace.  You are good with kids."  He was.  He was always helpful to those younger than him.  He may not have been the brightest dude in school, but when it came to figuring out the little pnuemonic tricks to remember things Jace was king.  But then again Jace had a near photographic memory, but unlike Dorian his talent was for shorthands.  Another talent worthy of the Venatori.  Was I jealous?  Yeah probably.  I had to be honest with myself, to be normal one way or the other would have been great.

Jace started rambling in his southern cajun accent and I couldn't understand him. He flopped backwards and his hands flailed over his head.  And before I could react I watched my laptop fall to the floor.  Even Jace hadn't had the speed to catch it from the angle he was at.  He blushed furiously, "Sorry man."

I shook my head as I made my way around to pick it up, it was damaged beyond repair.  "I did need a new one."  It was about time to upgrade, but I hoped I could salvage the data, I may not own a lot but all my music was sitting on that harddrive and I'd like to get that back.

"I'll take it to IT to see if I can retreive the data."  Jace looked  pitiful.  I grinned at him, "It's alright, promise."

Jace sighed, "I'll help replace it.  But right now breakfast.  Your coffee is done."

I nodded, "Alright to breakfast, not to you helping replace it.  I can manage that all on my own.  I really did need to replace it."

Jason looked at my shirt and frowned, "What no naugty saying."  His frown deepened, "Mia made me get rid of mine, I could live vicariously through you, but NO, you have to be polite today."

I grinned at Jace, "I do own a few that aren't like that you know."

Jace sighed, "Mia says they are childish.  I guess I'm a grown up now."

"You are going to be a dad after all.  But we all know I am childish."  

Jace punched me in the shoulder and headed out the door, "I was too.  You'll settle down with someone sooner or later and they'll make you change too."

I barked a laugh, "Yeah right.  Me settle down?"  Of course it was all an act.  Margo says I need to find someone, and said I should stop pushing people away.  But she also confirms it's how I've survived with my fears so it's a coping mechanism.  One day, maybe I'll stop, when I find that right person.  Right now it didn't matter.

We walked downstairs, breakfast was in full swing, the line was empty, but the cafeteria was full of people talking and eating with friends or alone.  It was almost a homecoming.  Heads turned as I walked in, it was not a rare occurance.  It was offputting.  Thankfully no one stared it was mostly those looking up to see who entered and see if they'd have company, but there were a few sneers.  It could have been my imagination.

We started into the food service area and Ms. Sheila was standing behind the plate glass barrier in her hair net and apron and I smiled at her, "Good Morning Ms. Sheila."

She looked up from the plate she was dishing out with a smile.  "Well, look-ee here.  Ain't you a sight for sore eyes.  All growed up and everything.  I heard you were back in town."

I grinned, "All growed up, at least on the outside.  I'll have whatever you got cooking."

She nodded her head and started plating as she spoke, "I remember the first day you showed up here with Dorian Vega.  So small and quiet.  Look at you now.  Loud and obnoxious and not so small."

"Yes, ma'am, that was a long time ago."

She nodded and grinned at me as she handed me a plate. 

Jason chimed in, "True dat."

I rolled my eyes at Jace.  "Can't take the country out of the boy can we?"

Ms. Sheila rolled her eyes too.  "Just like we can't take the sarcasm outta you boy."  She smiled.  "Move along now before you hold up the line."

I laughed, "Line?  We are the last of the line." As the words left my mouth a gaggle of teenage girls entered the doorway.  Jace moved past me avoiding the girls and heading through the rest of the line.  I turned and watched him leave through the exit.  "How things have changed!"  Jace would have flirted before, growing up, becoming a dad, getting married, something hand changed my best friend - probably for the better.

I nodded farewell to Ms. Sheila, "Until dinner."  I gave her a flourished bow and the girls behind me giggled.  I turned to them with the same bow, "Ladies."  More giggling followed me out the door as I heard Ms. Sheila comment, "Always the flirt."  I couldn't let anyone down now could I.  

I put my food on my new tab starting and they'd deduct cost from my so-called pay check.  Not that I really got paid anyway.  It was all a supliment and no one ever said anything unless you go way over budget.  I'd never balanced a book in my life.

I sat across from Jace at a table, "Girls bother you?"

Jace shook his head, "No man, those are some mean bitches."

I raised my eyebrow at him, "Nothing they can say or do that I've not already had done to me."

Jace grinned at me, "Yeah but I ain't you.  And 'sides, Mia would kill me if they started spreading untrue rumors."

"Ah.  Mia.  That explains alot."

Jace gave me a dirty look as I glanced down at my plate to see what adorned it.  Bacon, eggs, extra toast and two glorious cups of coffee, one in a to-go cup even.  I adored Ms. Sheila.  

I started eating slowly, everything was a reminder of this place, even eating.  I'd been told not to rush my first day.  Lunch with Dorian, in the middle of my first test, I'd been shoveling food as fast as Jace was now.  I wondered if my friend was in a hurry.  I looked up at him and he grinned, "I'm running late.  Class."

I mouthed, "Ah!"  I looked up at the entrance of the cafeteria as I brought a fork full of eggs to my mouth and it froze there.  Aaron Woolbright, my ex-roommate, and my biggest bully walked in the door with a bunch of boys following in his wake.  I finished the bite of food as I saw them walk towards me and Jace. 

Where there had been whispers before, there was none now.  The entire cafeteria was quiet and all eyes were on me and Aaron.  I took a deep breath pushing down the fear that the man brought up in me.  

In the moments that it took Aaron to walk to me I assessed the large black man who once had threatened my everyday life.  He looked like he lived in the gym, the boys that followed were a poor imitation of him.  His baseball cap that he wore backwards sported the colors of the White Sox, his home team.  He still dressed and walked like the thug that he was.

Jace turned around to see what was going on and frowned, "Let's go Nox.  We don't need this."

I shook my head, "I'm not going anywhere."  I wanted to add he doesn't scare me, but he did.  I knew I could handle him, he was strong in fire, but he was a brute with it.  He was a firestarter too, he'd roomed with me that first night.  He was the reason Mushu had burnt.  The memory brought a small pang at the loss - my only friend.

Jace went back to his plate and ignored things as they started to play out.  Aaron stood beside me with a nasty smile on his face, I grinned mischeviously up at him, "Hey Aaron, long time no see."

Aaron hadn't liked my greeting, he pushed my tray across the table, I managed to grab the to-go cup as it flew past me.  At least I'd still get coffee.  I watched as it disappeared over the edge and crashed to the floor.  I turned back to Aaron and sighed, "Well that was uncalled for."

Aaron grabbed me by the collar of my t-shirt and hoodie and pulled me to my feet.  I didn't have time to react as a blow landed in my stomach knocking the wind out of me.  He threw the first punch, there were witnesses.  I really wasn't in the mood for this, but I wasn't going to let these bullies have another inch.  Aaron grumbled at me "No one wants your kind here.  Why don't I show you the door?"

I pulled myself out of his grasp and backed away with a grin on my face.  I fought through the pain that radiated through my adominal muscles.  I hopped he hadn't cracked a rib.  I laughed, "My kind?  You mean handsome, fun, eccentric?"

That earned me another punch but I was ready this time and I had a thin wall of air in front of me, his hand bounced back with ease.  He glared at me.  "Everything's always a joke with you punk.  I'll wipe that smile off your face."

The man truly was stupid he threw a second punch at my face I thickened the wall and he slammed hard into it.  "You little mother fucker."

He started gathering fire about him, I laughed and I wrapped him in air and sucked all the air out of the bubble.  Fire did nothing if it couldn't breathe, Aaron started gasping for air.  I smiled at him with malice in my eyes, "You want to play games.  Let's see how you do now that I can bend the elements freely out of Dae'lin's mindful eye.  What she gonna do now?  Send me away?  Yeah, that's a punishment.  Away from asshats like you.  Try again, Aaron."

I let the patterns go and Aaron gasped and started to rush me but his friends were smarter than he was and pulled him back, I smiled at them.  They could take it anyway they wanted, but I was grateful they were holding him back.

I collected the mess that had become of my breakfast and tossed it away.  I sighed at least there was still coffee.  Jace and I left the cafeteria I could feel the eyes on my back as I left and the rush of noise started up - most likely talking about me, but that was hardly new.

# Feeling Lighter
_Monday, June 15, 2015 8:15AM_

We walked slowly, Jace was stalling.  I stopped before a stair well and asked, "What's wrong?"

Jace shook his head, "Nothing.  I don't get why you let him walk all over you at the start.  Do you know how many people would cheer if you gave him a beat down?  You could you know, beat him."

I grinned, "To prove what?  That I'm bigger and badder than he is?  I could care less about him.  He's a boy in a man's world.  He's sitting here being big man on campus.  I've hunted vampires and dragons.  And as long as I don't start the fight, Jace, no one can say I'm being the bully when I show him just what I'm capable of."

Jace nodded, "You should still kick the shit out of him."  Jace turned to the stair well and put his hand on the push bar, "He's gotten worse since we were kids."

"I had noticed that.  And the boys that follow him are even stupider than they were back then."

He gave a small laugh, "I got a class to teach.  If you find some free time today stop by.  Show the kids what you are all about.  They've heard so much from me, I'd love for you to jump for them so that I can show them exactly what inspired me, so you can inspire them too."

I nodded, "Sure.  I'll try to make it up there."

Jace wrapped his arm around my neck and gave me a quick hug and whispered in my ear, "I missed you bro.  Stay around."

I smiled and patted his back, "I'll try to do that too."

Jace opened the door to the stair well and left me alone.  I had a few minutes before I needed to be in Margo's office.  I decided now would be a good time to drop my laptop off in the dungeon's that the IT department called home.  I took the stairs up and headed towards my room.

In my room I sighed, we'd left the coffee pot on and now my room smelled like burnt coffee.   I dumped the pot and turned the machine off.  I'd have to go buy some air freshener or something.  Nothing I could conjur up would actually remove smell only aggitate the dust and the windows were sealed shut.  

I grabbed my laptop and took the elevator down stairs to the basement.  It wasn't really a dungeon, but as a kid it had felt like one when we spent a stint working there.  It was annoying, and it smelled musty and was dark and damp.  I didn't like it.

I found the repair room and rolled my eyes at the sign on the door, it said "Bat Cave".  I knocked on the open door and stepped inside.  A kid with chocolate brown hair sat fiddling with a screw driver and small screw in some peice of equipment.  When I knocked he jumped.  I appologized, "Sorry man."

He looked up at me, his name plate on his desk said "Nate Monroe".

I held up my laptop and he frowned, "You don't expect me to fix that do you."

I laughed, "No.  But I was hoping that you could retreive the data on it so I didn't lose all my files."

He frowned.  "I don't really have time."

"Alright, tell me what I need to do to do it myself and I'll take care of it.  I don't have anything important for the case I'm working but I'd like to have my music back."

Nate looked at me with disdain, "I'm sure your porn is easily replacable."

I had to laugh, it felt good to let that out.  I surprised myself with the length of my laughter.  I quipped, "I dunno, some them girls I filmed are pretty damn hot, I'd hate to lose that footage."

His eyes went wide and his mouth dropped.  I grinned at his reaction, "I could really use your help when you have time.  It's not important."

Nate nodded, "You are him.  Aren't you?"

"Him who?"

"Kai Viddens' half human son.  I recognize you from a picture he has sitting on his desk. You are here helping grandfather find the man who hurt Uncle Nicholas aren't you?"

I nodded but was slightly taken aback, "Grandfather??  You must be Iris' son?"

Nate nodded, "Yeah, one of them anyway.  I'll help you out if you promise me to find that bastard."  He turned red he probably would have been yelled at by Kai or Iris.  Such a strict way to live, I wouldn't have liked it.

"I'll do my best." I assured him.

Nate nodded, "That's all I can ask."  

I handed Nate my card, "You can call me here with the results.  A flash drive or in the cloud someplace I can grab it would be awesome."

Nate nodded as he took the card I offered him.  He glanced at my name, "Alright Uncle Nox.  I'll do that.  I need to get back to work."

I nodded with a salute and headed out the door. I had just enough time to be early for my appointment with Margo.  

Margo's office was in the Infirmary.  Not where they actually had medical emergencies or check ups but there were offices.  I walked into the waiting room, it smelled like apples.  It always smelled like apples.  The woman at the front desk looked up as I walked in and a great big smile grew on her lips.  "Megan.  A pleasure.  It's been a while."

She tapped the intercom with a grin, "Dr. Silverman your 9:30 is here."  Megan tossed her raven locks over her shoulder and smiled at me again, "Take a seat Nox, she'll be right with you."

I nodded and sat down in the posh chairs, the decor of the room matched that of the scent used.  It felt like a up scale apple orchard farm house.  There was a bowl of plastic apples on the coffee table, there was even a live tree in the corner.  It wasn't a real apple tree, but there were little plastic apples hanging from it.

It was meant to be relaxing.  There was forest sounds playing softly in the speakers around the room.  I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes and relaxed into the serenity of the atmosphere.  I heard the office door open and a pair of high heels tapping their way in my direction.  There was a pause and then she continued towards me and sat down next to me.  I could smell the soft hint of apples in Margo's perfume and smiled, "Good morning, Margo.  I truly missed this."

I could hear the smile in her voice, "We can sit here for a moment if you like."

I nodded and didn't open my eyes.  "Aaron started a fight with me in the cafeteria."

"Right to the point.  As always.  How did that make you feel?"

I sat up and opened my eyes and turned towards the woman who had been asking me that question for well over 17 years.  I grinned at her, "As it always does.  I didn't like it.  I fought the panic that wanted to creep in.  He got in one lucky punch to the stomach.  I could have lost it then."

Margo nodded, "What did you do?"

"I fought the feeling, and I blocked his other blows, he didn't like that he started bending fire.  I smothered it and him until I said my peice then walked away."

She smiled, "That's good.  Ready to go in and sit and talk more privately."

I nodded and stood up.  I offered Margo my arm and she laughed, "Ever the charmer.  We did miss you."

I winked at her and then at Megan as I walked passed her.  "Ever the flirt too."

I grinned, "Of course, I must be me."

Margo shook her head, "You must be the person you created at every possible turn.  You know that's not you."

And there it was, the shirnking started.  I sat down in the chair and sighed, "Yeah but if I'm the real me outside of this room or my own private thoughts I'd be depressed, or worse dead."

Margo nodded, "I'm glad you understand that.  But you have to let someone in, or you going to be even more lonely now that Jason has a life outside of you."

I laughed, "I've spent three years away from him.  I know that already.  I've not had a single relationship that lasted more than a few weeks since I left here.  I can't find it in myself to trust anyone that much."

"You push people away, Nox.  You always have.  Jason gave you something without you asking, he told you he was like you.  He opened up to you with his choices and you cling to it.  You have to let someone else do that for you."

I sighed and leaned back against the leather couch, "I know.  I try and then I can't.  They do something that sets me off.  They trap me, and it doesn't have to be physical anymore, an emotional entrapment sets me off too."

"So tell me why you booked this appointment before you even got here?"

I grinned, "I knew something would happen the moment I get in the door.  I've had Dae'lin assualt me with her desire to procreate.  I met a girl on the plane over and she wants me to be _that_ gay friend.  My father doesn't want me here, he threw me up against a wall.  Jace broke my laptop.  And then there's this knew attraction to someone I've known my entire life."

She smiled.  "And who might this someone be?"

I frowned and looked down.  "Dorian Vega."

Margo stopped the lift of her water glass to her lips as I said his name, she smiled like she had some kind of hidden answer in what I'd said.  "And this bothers you more than everything else."

"Yes and no.  I'm surprised I never noticed how hot he was before."  I could feel my body stir at the thought of his blue eyes, his gorgeous smile and the way his pants fit him.  I had to redirect my thoughts.  "He's always been there.  I don't think I have a chance in the world.  I can't imagine why he'd even consider a punk like me."

Margo nodded, "That's not the whole of it, is it?"

I sighed and closed my eyes.  "He knows more about me than anyone else in the world.  He's studied me, I'm nothing more than his claim to fame.  And yet he says he cares.  He said I had to tell you something I told him.  He said it would explain a lot.  And he's probably right."

"You don't want to tell me?"

"I've kept it from you since the day we met."  I sat forward and opened my eyes, I could feel the tears welling up hot in my eyes.  "Garrett beat me as a child.  He veiled the cameras and he used air and earth to make me spark."

Margo just nodded, "I suspected as much, and worse."  I shuddered, it was reflex.  "That triggered something?"

I shook my head, "Nothing conscious.  My body just reacted.  I dream about it every night.  I see his face, sometimes it's morphed into demons or dragons or various monsters.  But I know it's always Garrett.  He hits me and I wake in fear - every night."

"Your night terrors.  I always wondered why you never went into details about them.  Why didn't you tell me?"

"I was afraid.  I was always afraid.  I'm still afraid he'll torment me if he knows I told someone.  But if he touches me I'll kill him."  I sighed, "This time I won't cave to my emotions."

Margo nodded, "Let's hope it never comes to that.  Is there anything else?  Our time is almost up."

I shook my head.  "I'll be good.  I have a case to work, my best friend back in the area and I've a guy to keep my mind occupied hopefully."

Margo smiled, "I look forward to our next meeting."  She winked at me.  "I've not had any good stories in a while."

I stuck my tongue out at her and smiled.  "Thanks.  I'll see you next week."  I stood up and walked to the door.  "I'll figure out Dorian someday, don't think it'll be by next week."  I opened the door and stopped at Megan's desk.

She looked up at me, "Same time next week?"

I nodded with a wink, "Yes ma'am."

She smiled, "I'll schedule you in.  See you next week Nox."

I waved at Megan and Margo as I walked out the door.  I didn't feel better, but I felt lighter.  I always felt lighter after I talked with Margo.

# Gathering Information
_Monday, June 15, 2015 10:30AM_

I could go see Jace and his class now, but it was probably better to get some more work done.  I didn't really get anywhere yesterday, but I did have some new thoughts now.  What if among the Exuli there were Magnus who were working with one of the two that Kai and Emilio had a hand in?  It was a thought, and one that I'd have a hard time making ends meet without my computer.

So I headed towards the Archives.  The archives was full of written records and up until recently had been run by the old fashioned card catalog systems.  Now everything was digitized and searchable, but the archives were still up todate with every record ever created, even digitally.  It was some lowly technical savvy Scrin's job to print the reports and make sure everything was up todate in the archive records.  An audious task but necessary.  God forbid the apocolypse happened. And yes, the Venatori beleived one day technology would fail.  A long lived supernatural race beleived in a great many things, and it was that fear that kept us on task.

As I walked into the Archives I was still amazed at the shear number of books and tomes that lined the walls.  There were rows upon rows of shelvings, all filled to the brim with books.  We may not live forever like the Aeternus that started this mission, but their records lived on in us and we followed our purpose without hesitation. 

In the center of the first room there was a woman, she had goregeous green eyes that were only enhanced by the bronzing of her skin and the white of her smile.  Her eyes sparkeled as she smiled at me when she noticed I'd walked in.  I'd been in here before but I was much younger.  I recognized the woman but I couldn't put a name to the face.  She had aged well, but you could tell she tried to dye her graying hair.  She smelled like honey dew melon and something sweet I couldn't place, but it wasn't offensive in the least.  It was oddly comforting.  

I smiled at her as I approached the desk. I noticed the long emerald green pendants dangling from silver chains along her long neck, she was exquisit.  Though not a woman even remotely in my ball park as the ring on her left ring finger spoke of her holy matrimony.  She looked a faithful woman.  

She smiled, "I didn't expect to see you here."

I frowned playfully, "Why not?"  She knew who I was, I was at a disadvantage, I disliked that feeling.  But she was friendly enough my defense mechanisms didn't kick into gear, at least not right away.

"Your father was very adamant you not be brought into this.  But you are probably one of the most tech savvy of the hunters, I expect your computers could do the work faster."  The smile never left the woman's mouth, she was kind and motherly and she clearly knew me well.

I stated the obvious, "So you know who I am then, and why I'm here?" 

The woman nodded, "Yes.  You are Nox Sétanta.  My son speaks highly of your abilities as both Magnus and venatori alike."

There was only one person who spoke highly of my skills and that was Dorian Vega.  He was the only one who thought I was special and unique.  Everyone else pretty much thought I was inferior, unworthy of breathing the same air.

I grinned at her, "And that would make you Dolores Vega."  She offered me her hand I shook firmly and then kissed the middle knuckle.   "You are exactly the person I need.  I'm looking into family history.  Viddens, Vegas and as many Exuli as I possibly can get my hands on.  There is a connection, I just need to find it."

Mrs. Vega put a finger to her lip and I noticed the matching emerald nail polish adorning the long finger nail.  She tapped he finger against her lip and I was only reminded of her sons lush lips.  I sighed and she gave me a glance.  I shook my head, nothing was wrong, only that the man I'd grown up trusting my life too was now plauging my waking thoughts in very uncharateristic ways.

I had to keep my mind on task.  But being with Mrs. Vega that was going to be difficult.  The similiarites in the two were too much.  Dorian was not a girly man.  He was very much the perfect image of masculinity.  If you didn't know him you'd hardly suspect he preferred the company of men.  Such was his image, and I was well aware that his image was his life.  There was no room for a little punk like me.  

My mood fell but Dolores Vega smiled and the world lit back up.  I would have to do something about this infatuation with Dorian, but right now I had work to do.  "Come with me, I think you'll find all the information you need in the Ancenstry room.  I won't be easy.  Why are you doing this by hand?"

I grinned, "My laptop went for a tumble.  And this is the least likely place for my father to find me."

She nodded, "Perhaps that is true.  And avoiding him is key?"

"Not really.  I figure if I stay away from him he can't beat me over the head with the whole not wanting me around."

She lead me down a few aisles and to a room with nothing on the door.  She opened it and flipped on the light.  The florscent bulbs flickered and blinked as they finally clicked on fully.  I had always hated those type lights, they were hard to read by and they made everything yellow.  But beggers can't be choosers and I was certainly not the one who had control over renovations.  The musty smell of a unused room hit me like a wall and I tried not to let it show on my face.

On the table just inside the room there was a pile of books.  She smiled at me, "I think what you are looking for might be on the table.  Dorian was here two days ago searching through Kai's and his father's records.  He too thought this was a good place to hide from those who didn't want him poking his nose into things."

I grinned, "Of course he would."  

Mrs. Vega then pointed to a section in the back corner, "Over there is where you will find the records on the Exuli most recently exiled - with in the past 100 years or so."

I nodded my thanks.  "I thank you for your help."

I started into the door but Mrs. Vega caught my arm and I turned to her, "You beleive Dorian is correct?"  

I nodded, "It makes sense, he is the reknowned expert on Cesari.  I trust his judgement."

She nodded, "Kai beleives that it is coincidence it is our families are being targeted, high profile hunters."

I nodded, "It's possible.  But then the Rivera's should also be targeted yes?  They are high profile too."

"Possibly, don't limit yourself to one belief or another.  I heard through the grape vine that a certain young man is awake.  And I also have it on good source that your father and my husband are out of the building, if you wished to speak with him about what he saw.  Your time with the boy will be limited, now is the perfect oppurtunity.  These books can wait."

I smiled.  "Kai's son...I think I'll do that."  She nodded. "Thank you Mrs. Vega for your assistance."  

I turned off the light and shut the door and we walked back to the front of the Archives chatting about nothing in particular.  It was good to speak so freely with someone.  It wasn't something I would usually do.  She reminded me very much of her son, someone I could confide in and know he wasn't judging me.

I left Mrs. Vega with a flourishing bow which sent the young girl at the desk into fits of giggles Mrs. Vega had to shush.  I chuckled to myself as I walked out the door.

The Infirmary was several flights below but I took the stairs anyway, it was habit.  It was also good exercise and I didn't have any panic attacks.

Life with the Venatori had its ups and downs.  We didn't own anything, we didn't earn money as the outside world did.  There was no need, we were completely cared for with in the confines of the compound.  We wanted for nothing.  If we needed a new computer we could requisition one, sometimes you were told no, but most of the time you given everything at the mere request of it.

We even had our own research hospital on campus.  Most stations didn't have that, but they had their own infirmary - a place for emergencies and well care of us.  But here, our infirmary doubled as a research facility.  The research went from cures for cancer to the physiology of a dragon.  It was rather epic if you thought about it.  But I wasn't here for that.

I stopped at the front desk and asked, "I'm here to see Kai Vidden's boy.  I'm family."

The woman looked up with her smokey brown eyes and frowned, "Relation?"

"I'm his brother."  It felt extremely odd saying that out loud.  I of course had known I had brothers and a sister here in the compound.  I'd learned that when I had found out I had a father.  I hardly knew any of my blood relatives.

She handed me a badge that said visitor and directed me to ICU on the second floor, she gave me a room number too.  "Take care, he is awake, but don't over stress him."

I nodded at the instructions and took the stairs up to the second floor of the Infirmary.  I found his room and had to double check the room number because the name on the door said Nicholas Hampton - not a Vidden.  

I sighed.  Nick was my brother.  No wonder Dae'lin had done what she did.  I walked into his room after knocking on the open door.  "Hey man."

He looked up and his eyes spoke to the pain he was in.  Burns sucked.  I remembered mine all too well, they itched at the memories.

He smiled and it looked like it hurt to do that simple thing, "Hey Nox, what you doing here.  Only family's allowed."

I nodded, "Hey bro.  At least that's what you are technically - my half brother."

Nick processed the information and frowned.  "So... that's awkward."

I laughed as I pulled up a chair to sit closer to Nick.  I put my hand on his and patted softly before putting my hand on the edge of the bed instead of resting it on his.  He was my brother despite the intamcy we'd shared as young boys.  

It was harmless fun, but the knowledge that I made out with my brother makes me squirm and it apparently made Nick squirm too.

I smiled.  "You've looked better."

Nick grinned at me, "You look a bit worse for wear too."  He ran his finger down his own face indicating where my scar ran.

"Disgruntled ghost possessing a girl.  Her knife got a peice of me before I removed the culprit and extinqueished the poltergeist.  And that's not even the worst of them."

Nick nodded, "Anything as exciting as a bomb blowing up in your face?"  He was joking.  Nick was a tech consultant, he was damn good at his job too.  He set up a great number of the new systems in Boulder during the retro fit there this past November.

"Dragon fire comes the closest."  I lifted my leg and pulled my left pant leg to my knee and he whistled.  

"At least you healed."

I grined, "You'll heal too.  It doesn't feel like it now, but you look pretty damn good considering it happened only a short time ago.  I'd probably still be on morphin drip."  There was an uncomfortable silence as we pondered our own thoughts.  

I finally interrputed the silence, "I hate to bother you but can I ask you a few questions?"

He nodded, "Father said you might be by and that I could make my own decisions."

I laughed, "He did, did he? So may I?"

He nodded and he winched in pain and I frowned.  

"Thanks.  You remember anything about the package?"

Nick grabbed his glass of water and took a small sip from it.  I knew the pain I saw on his face all to well but he answered me anyway, "It was a regular package.  But it didn't look like it had come from the mailroom, but it was stamped and everything so I guess it had.  A kid handed it to me.  Had my name on it and everything."

"You don't think it came from the mailroom?"

Nick shrugged, "It was just a feeling I had, why else would a kid give it to me.  I guess it was delivered incorrectly.  It happens."

"The kid you remember who it was?  What he looked like?"

Nick shook his head, "I didn't know him.  He's new, still in high school, I think.  Dark hair, that's all I really remember."

"Thanks man.  I appreciate it.  I hope this goes quickly for you.  Burns suck."

Nick nodded, "Thanks man.  And thanks for stopping by.  Though I'd rather you weren't my brother."  He winked at me suggestively.  I grinned at him.  We would have had a good time.  I swallowed hard, that wasn't going to happen ever now.  Nick looked lost in thought, "Father doesn't like the fact that I'm gay."

"I can imagine.  He probably blames me for turning you gay."

Nick smirked, "He does.  He never says it in so many words, but when he speaks of it, it's always, if he hadn't kissed you like that, you'd be fine. I don't blame you.  You weren't even the first guy I kissed.  Just the only one I got caught kissing."  Nick added, "At least you actually like girls though."

I sighed, "It doesn't help that much really.  The fact that I like guys gets the most attention."

Nick laughed softly trying not to hurt himself, "Then stop being all 'oh I like guys' at every turn."

I grinned, "But that's me.  I like making people uncomfortable."

He nodded, "I know.  Thanks for coming by." I nodded and waved farewell.  

As I was about to shut the door Nick called out my name.  "Hey Nox?"  I turned to look at him and he smiled, "Maybe when I'm outta here we can hang out.  Just me and you - brothers.  Go dancing, have a drink, pick up some guys?"

I smiled, "Yeah sure thing Nick.  We can hang out when you are out of here, though the dancing and guys might have to wait a little longer than that."  I waved to him again, "See you round bro."

It felt odd, but it felt good too.  To actually have family that actually liked me that was blood.  I had enough family, but I might start liking having more.


# Inspiring the Young
_Monday, June 15, 2015 11:30AM_

I left ICU with only minimal issues.  The nurses whispered behind my back, some even right in front of me.  I flashed them a smile and some looked away embarrassed others blushed.  It was obvious which were gossiping and those that were admiring.  I got more of the embarrassed looks than not Kai must have been having words with them.  I felt for any of them who might get their ears burned when he returns to find I'd seen his son.

I started down the stairs and as I rounded the corner of the first flight I ran into a near immovable object.  I looked down and saw the raven hair and bright blue eyes shining up at me with a wide smile.  "I was just coming to warn you." Dorian said as I took a step back.

I raised an eyebrow and he continued, "My mother informed me you were visiting Nicholas, and I just saw Kai enter the building."

Grinning at the man before me, "Thanks for the warning, had a good talk with Nick."

Dorian frowned, "Sounds like you are familiar with Nicholas?"

I laughed, how had the photographic memory of Dorian Vega forgotten a fact.  I grinned mishieveously at him, "We were lab partners once upon a time.  I'm sure you remember that."

It was only moments as Dorian parsed his memory,and then nodded, "Chemistry?"

I smiled, "And a little biology, or was it health education."

Dorian smirked to cover the blush that was forming at the base of his neck, "Ah yes.  The boy Dae'lin caught you in the halls kissing."

I nodded.  "I wish someone would have told me then he was my half-brother.  It makes so much sense now.  Why Dae'lin didn't want me cozzying up to him.  I beleive the threat was 'You ever see that boy in anything other than school work and I'll not only have your hide, I'll hang it from my office wall.'"

Dorian chuckled, "That sounds like Dae'lin."  He sighed, "It was of less concern that you and Nicholas be more friends than you and your father know of each others existance.  I beleive you and Nick were an experiment of sorts.  To see how the same blood could be affected by the nurture."

I rolled my eyes.  "Another lovely experiment I am part of.  I am thankful now that Dae'lin caught us though.  Nick and I were going places fast that day.  Seeing him again brought those feelings back up and I had to squash them because they are nothing now.  He's my brother."

Dorian nodded, there was sympathy in his eyes.  He smiled and changed the subject, "I have a favor to ask of you."

"Shoot."

"I have a new Magnus.  He's rather ... difficult to say the least.  His third mentor resigned from his service today citing irrevocable differences.  He's a good kid - rather he could be a good kid.  I know it."

There was little hesitation in my answer, if Dorian beleived the kid redeemable he was.  Dorian was a good judge of character, he always had been.  I had always trusted his judgement, there was no reason to doubt him now.

Dorian continued, "Since you are here for an indeterminate amount of time I'd like you to try to mentor him.  If we cannot get him to learn about his gift, there is only one choice left.  And I do not like the idea of turning his potential into a Tacet."

"That bad?"  To be tacet was unthinkable.  I'd only met a handful of them in my short life.  They were empty souls with little to live for.  But it was what happened if you couldn't control your magic.  "You think I can have any impact?"

Dorian nodded, "You are more like him than the others.  Outcasts.  He's sixteen, Nox.  He was found on the streets, his parents dead.  A house fire they didn't escape from.  Likely he set it by accident when he came into his powers."  Dorian frowned, "He has no one.  Maybe you and he can get along, even if you can't teach him, he might listen to you."

"Yeah, sure," I nodded, "When?"  Dorian grinned and I knew exactly what he wanted, right now.  I laughed, "Now, it is then."

We started down the stairs together.  The silence was nice, it wasn't uncomfortable, my hand itched to hold his, but I kept my hands to myself.  I glanced at him from the corner of my eye and kept wondering why I was feeling like a teenager around him.  

Dorian took the next door way into what became the academy proper.  I thought fondly on the times I'd followed Dorian here, today though was different.  We walked as equals, or at least collegues.  I commented on it, "This is different."

Dorian asked, "How so?"  But he glanced at me with a knowing smile, he felt the difference too.  There was so much hope building inside me at that one glance.

"The last time we walked this way," I smiled, "I followed you a decrete distance behind you."  I needed to change the subject, "Tell me of the kid you are taking me to."  Might as well get the down and dirty details from the source instead of having to read them.  We walked and I fought the urge to steal looks at this man who was ravaging my hormones.

"He was brought in from the streets a few months ago.  He was starved and dehydrated and was not in any shape what-so-ever to do much of anything.  We fed him and gave him a safety zone.  A hunter found him in a homeless shelter starting fires with the snap of his fingers."

"Untrained in fire, but he has control.  That's unusual.  He's sixteen?"  I was skeptical.

Dorian nodded, "Yes, he's 16."

I laughed, "Sixteen and just now being found!"  It was very hard to believe. "Someone had to find him.  No one is that talented.  Particularly fire-starters."

Dorian agreed, "Yes, but he won't tell us any names.  He is hardly forth coming at all.  Every mentor we've put him under has complained and he's ended up back in my care.  You are the last one.  I've already told you the consequences of his failure to listen to you.  We've tried everything. Maybe someone closer in age will help him."

I nodded, "What have the others done?"

"He's working on his GED online.  He's too far behind to stick in classes his own age for schooling and if we'd stick him where he needs to be he'd be even more out of place.  He's restricted to his quarters when not with his mentor or in the lab because he's just a terror on everyone."  Dorian sighed.

"Put him in classes.  I don't care what.  Art, Music, PE with kids his age.  Stick him in Jason's class, he's supposedly working some new angle. Dae'lin's got a few advanced kids she's tutoring in multiple elements, put him in there too.   I'll watch him in them until he's behaving if I have to.  You can't isolate a kid and expect him to behave like he understand social interactions.  As a matter of fact, stick him in all of Jason's classes.  The younger the better.  If he's multi-talented and you think he could be Cesari too well then he can inspire them, help them too."

Dorian laughed, "You take the opposite approach to everyone.  I will create a schedule that he can start after we get you on a real schedule here.  But... how did you guess my speculation of the boy?"

I smiled, "Why else would you choose me as your last attempted instead of the last person.  You didn't know I was coming to town."

Dorian opened a testing room door with a smile.  Dorian let me go in first and closed the door behind him.  "Levi, this is Nox.  He is going to be your new mentor.  Remember lad, what we discussed."  He started in on the Tacet lecture again as I took in the boy.

The boy was slumped in the chair, one leg over the arm the opposite arm hanging over the other arm like he'd been plopped in the chair without any bones.  He hid his face beneath a baseball cap sporting the Sox logo like Aaron's earlier.  He reminded me of a puppet from the marionette show I'd seen as a young child.  Something to entertain the kids he didn't remember much else of it.  I wondered if I could pull the strings like the puppet and make him dance.  The thought made me smile and I could have sworn the boy sneered at me.  He didn't smell like a fire-starter, they almost always smelled like smoke.  Fire wasn't his base element.  

But as I returned to Dorian's calm patient tone, I realized he was sneering at the information Dorian was retelling. I smiled and interrupted Dorian, "I got this."

Dorian chuckled, "As you wish."  Dorian left the room, but I knew he'd go to the other side of the two way mirror to watch us.  It was his job to assess first meetings, and every other meeting afterwards, though he didn't follow every single child that walked through the doors.

I pulled a chair back and tipped it on its back to legs and wrapped air around it before sitting down.  I did it to see what Levi would do.  A show of power, a sort of bragging, but more importantly to see if he even noticed that my chair had stood up before I sat down.  I smiled at him, "So, Levi..."

He glanced at me then down under the table and then he stood up.  He walked around the table and squatted down to examine the chair, "How are you doing that?"

"You can't see it?" I inquired.  Levi shook his head.  "Look for the pattern holding the chair steady.  You can manipulate air, Dorian says he tested you."

Levi took his hat off and cliped it to his belt loop then ran his fingers through his dark hair.  "I just blew a bubble."

I grinned at his modesty, he sounded a lot like me, like it was nothing big.  And for him it probably was nothing.  "With your mind, inside a box.  Come on, think how would you do that if you could see air?"

I got out of Levi's way, I stood up and the chair remained standing on its back two legs.  I added some earth to the air so it would become a cloud instead of transparent.  "The earth should give it visibility to anyone.  Look for the pattern."  I sat down next to Levi on the floor and crossed my legs, "Every pattern is unique, everyone and everything has a different pattern."  

I waited for a little while before I prompted a bit more information to help Levi look for the pattern.  "Think of the patterns like lattice work.  You know those fake looking things up the sides of suburban houses that have vines and roses and other climbing plants on them.  But each object and each element create different lattices."

I sighed as I remembered my schooling.  "I could go on about chemical bonds or crystalline structures but I don't think that would help you at all.  And I'd sound too much like Dae'lin for my preference."

Levi started poking the patterns with his finger.  He asked, "Who's Dae'lin?  Your girlfriend or something?"

A sharp laugh escaped my lips before I could catch it and it made Levi jump.  I appologized, "Sorry.  Dae'lin was my mentor.  She is now my boss.  She insisted I maintain an A average in everything.  Which meant I spent most of my free time with my nose in a book, or on the computer to try to understand things that were just beyond me."

"Sounds like torture."  Levi continued to stare at the cloud of dirt and air but he didn't seeme to be getting any closer.

"It was at times.  But I had an hour every day to goof off, Jace made sure I used it wisely."

"Your boyfriend?"

I laughed, "What have you heard about me?"

The boy turned around and looked at me.  "Nothing.  It's just the way you talk about them.  I remember my parents talking that way about each other."

I nodded, "Jace is my best friend.  We've never been anything more.  He's the only true family I've had since I was five.  Dae'lin was my mentor, nothing more.  I respect her."  I sighed, the talk of family made him pull back, I could see it in his eyes as he turned back to work on the patterns before him.  "I'm sorry about losing your parents.  I know it's not easy."

Levi's voice sounded like the weight of the world just pressed down upon him.  He snapped, "What you know about it?"

"I wasn't as young as you when I lost my mother.  But she sent me away when I was 5 years old.  I never saw her again until I was 18.  So she might as well have already been gone."  Nox sighed, "On one of my first hunts after graduation.  I went back home, to my mother's home.  She needed help with a rogue were-bear.  It was terrorizing the community and humans alike.  It needed to be stopped but bullets weren't helping so they needed something a little more powerful."

Levi turned to face me again, he was at least still listening to me ramble about myself. "She and I went out to its lair.  It attacked, she'd insisted on going first, the veteran Venatori and all that jazz.  She took a swipe to the stomach and chest area, disemboweling her.  I managed to get a fireball off before it raked me and left me with a nice scar on my chest.  But it was dead.  I would live if I could get to help, but I was unable to save my mother.  If I'd insisted on going first I could have prevented the mess.  I'd have had shields and the like, but my mother was stubborn.  She'd told me, none of that magic stuff.  It was my magic that saved me and why I'd been called in.  But she was old school."

Levi went back to looking at the pattern, "She was stupid.  No offense."

I nodded, "None taken, I agree with you."

I could hear the curiousity in his voice as he asked, "What about your dad?"

I sighed.  "I didn't know my dad, still technically I don't.  I mean I now know who he is, but to me he's just some man who hates me.  He can join the club of haters.  I don't really care."  It was time to get back to the task at hand.  "Tell me what you see Levi."  I could see that he was fustrated.  Patterns were important to see, you had to see them to use your potential.

The boy sighed, "I don't know."

I brought the chair down and released the patterns.  "Turn and face me, let's try this a little differently."
 
He was having difficulty with air lets try what he was stronger in.  "What is your strongest element?" I asked, hoping it wasn't water.

Levi replied flatly, "Water."

I shook my head, "Of course, it would be my weakest."  I paused a moment and gathered my strength, water alone always gave me fits, it moved so irratically and defied my will.  "Alrighty.  There is water all around us, it's in the air, in our bodies.  You are a four?"  I asked, but I already knew the answer.  I could tell from the patterns around him.  I'd learned to read a person's skill set and level without the need of a test.  I always found it odd that no one else did, except maybe Dorian.  "You can replicate water if it's there."

Levi nodded, "That's what I've been told."  I hadn't needed the confirmation but I was glad for the validation.  I tried to figure out the easiest way to show him the patterns when the door behind me opened, and Dorian handed me a bottle of water.  I looked up at him with a beaming smile, "You read my mind."

Dorian smiled back, "I'll find the rest of the materials for you and bring you them so you can work with them."

I nodded and Dorian shut the door and we went back to work.  "Water is slippery.  It moves and shiftes, it moves like you'd imagine water would.  The pattern is constantly shifting.  It is the hardest element to manipulate and the odd man out.  I'm guessing you learned to control water first.  Which is also probably why you aren't seeing the simplier patterns."  

I smiled as I poured a small amount of water in my hand.  "Focus on the water."  I shifted the water around by bending and twisting its pattern.  I could see the small elements of life sparkling inside of it.  It always looked like diamonfs when I focused too hard.  "Try to watch the patterns shift.  You need to look deep down inside it.  It's like using a microscope."  That was an idea.  I'd have to visit the labs and see if that would be helpful later, if he didn't get it now.

Levi was unsure of himself as he spoke quietly with his hand in front of his mouth, "I think I see something, but I don' tknow."

I nodded.  "Hold out your hand."  I poured a small amount of water in his hand, "Try to reproduce the pattern I'm showing you.  Exactly like mine is."

I watched Levi shift the patterns, but he wasn't shifting the patterns, he was pushing the water around and pulling it in other places.  It was close but I could see the small intricasies of the pattern that weren't there.  "Nice try."  I pointed to various places that were wrong and Levi toss the water at me.  I smiled.  "It's hard when you can just do it.  But if you want to progress father, and do more amazing things, you need to see the patterns."

"You started a fire accidentally?"  It was more a rhetorical question as I was fairly sure that was why his house had burnt down with his parents inside.

Levi got up and kicked the chair across the room, "Yeah.  Thanks for the reminder."

I put my arms behind me and leaned back on my hands, "Hey, it's okay.  I was a fire-starter too.  It's why my mother sent me away."  I sighed, and sat up as Levi turned to look at me, "She beleives that children shouldn't be treated any different than a rouge Magnus.  When a supernatural is dangerous, they are dangerous, it doesn't matter if the creature is your own son or not."  The memories flooded in and I closed my eyes to rid them from my minds eye, "She sent me away so I didn't have to make her feel conflicted."  I opened my eyes and smiled, "So I understand.  Really."

I pulled my lighter out of my pocket.  I always carried it with me in case of emergency.  Fire was my go to element and sometimes you are just too tired to create it from nothing, a lighter helps with that.  "Watch me."  I held the lighter up and flipped it on and took the flame from the receptical and it floated above my hand.

I changed the flickering flame to a hollow ball of fire and air.  The air kept the shape, I could do it with fire alone but the fire would die out eventually as I instructed.  "Try."

I held the lighter out to Levi with a tiny flame flickering above it.  Levi deftly took the flame and started trying.  He was manipulating both air and fire at the same time but he wasn't using the patterns.  He couldn't see the patterns.  We'd have to find another way.

I smiled, "That's enough for now.  We need to break you of your old habits.  You'll get there eventually.  I can see the potential in you.  There are not many Cesari, and it's very likely that is why your other mentors failed to help you.  They don't understand the differences.

Levi asked, "What's Cesari?"

"A cesari is a magnus who can bend all four elements at the same time.  It's a rare gift, and you are one.  Dorian suspected it and he was right.  I can see it."

A tinny voice over the intercom interrupted us, "How do you know that Nox?"

I looked towards the two way mirror and smiled, "The way the pattern around him moves.  It's different than say Dae'lin's.  Everyone's is different, we vibrate on different frequencies, but all Cesari I've ever met the patterns all flow toward them.  It's a magnetic like attraction to all elements.  A water bender attracts water and repeal everything else.  Those like Dae'lin who can bend all four, they oscillate between things.  Dae'lin attracts air much easier than fire, but the patterns shift in a pattern of osculation.  I'm sure there is a mathematical equation that could tell you but I'm not that interested in that.  But you can see the differences if you pay attention.  The differences are small but I made a habit of studying patterns the day you showed me them."

Dorian chuckled over the intercom.  I couldn't even begin to imagine all the theories running through his head about this new peice of information.

I stood up shaking my hands, "Come on Levi.  I have a class I want to take you to. It'll be a bunch of little kids, but I would like you to listen to the class.  Jace claims to have a new way of thinking about things, maybe he'll help you out too."

I opened the door to the testing room and found Dae'lin leaning agains the opposite wall.  She smiled her angry smile at me.  I gave her my best smart ass grin.  She shook her head, "You didn't tell me you saw patterns that way."

I shrugged, "You never asked me."

She sounded miffed, "Did you tell Dorian or Jason?"

I shook my head.  "Dorian never asked either and Jace knew I saw things differently and he started playing with it but we never spoke on it to any great length."

Dae'lin nodded, "We need to sit down, the four of us, and discuss this.  You need to show us how, so we can teach others.  Unless you want to.  This is new Nox.  If what you say is true, then we can elimnate so many problems with classification.  There has never been a Cesari like you.   Everyone else wants to only create things, ultimately trying to be gods."

I was surprised when Levi asked, "We can be like God?"

I shook my head, "No.  Some Magnus think we can be.  They've mastered the art of creating cadavers or other living objects that resemeble them but they don't actually live.  We can't even use the creations for transplants, they just don't have that spark of life.  It would be like Frankenstein all over again."

Levi was incredulous, "That was real?"

I laughed and I heard a soft giggle from Dae'liln.  "Nah man.  Just an analogy.  Come on we'll be late.  And late gets us in trouble."  I winked at Dae'lin as we started for the classrooms thinking about the spark of life between the patterns particularly in water.  Maybe there was a way to harness it, but the world was probably better off with out that experiment.

Levi followed me up to Jace's class, he never complained about taking the stairs even after we passed the elevator.  I was grateful for that.  I opened up the door to Jace's class room and he looked up from his desk, they were quietly watching some pattern play out on the screen before them.  Technology couldn't capture it, but some ingenious person had found a way to mimic pattern manipulation on the screen.  I watched as Levi stared at the screen and I saw it click.

Jason beamed at me and stood up behind his desk and turned the digital patterns off, "Everyone, I'd like you to meet my best friend.  He's going to show us all something very special today.   We are going to go up to the roof top and watch Nox skyjump.  He has a new protege, and he'll be spending some time with us today and in the future.  So let's make Mr. Hughes feel welcome."  And once again the rumors moved faster than I did.

Levi laughed, "I'm Mr. Hugues and he's just Nox?  I see how I rate."

Jace grinned, "Have you ever called Nox, Mr. Sétanta?  I don't recomend you try.  But everyone in my class goes by Mister or Miss."

I leaned over to Levi and whispered loudly."That's the southern gentleman in him."  I grinned playfully at Jace and opened the door.  Beckoning the class to follow, "Let's go up to the roof.  There are a few rules you must all follow the moment you step foot on the roof."

The small class of five and six year olds lined up and followed me out the door.  Levi took up the rear and Jason followed him. I started in on my standard newb jumping rules,  "I am the boss.  What I say is law. If I say freeze I mean immediately.  If I say move you do it.  No one goes near the edge without being on the harness.  There is only Jason at the top and he's going to be busy.  Levi might be able to save you, but he's never seen this.  So harness before you get near the edge, or you will never make that roof again.  Ever!  And the last rule, you do not do this ever without me.  Never.  I don't care what you think you know or what your friends think they know.  I find you on the roof without me, you will NEVER do this again."  I pointedly looked at Levi, "That means you too."

I stopped at the last door and turned towards their eager faces, "Do we all understand?"  Everyone nodded heir heads, even though Levi's was reluctant.

As I opened the door Jace started in on his own little lesson, "Skyjumping is something Nox created to get over his fear of heights and falling.  We eventually got here, and the first hundred times or so we glided to the bottom.  Today, Nox is going to show you what inspired me and why I'm now teaching this class."

Jace set up the veil around the alley as I continued, "Mr. Hill is setting up a default canvas so that no one outside the alley sees what is happening.  So no one sees a falling person and calls the cops.  That's kinda awkward."

Jason was finished and turned back to his class. "The belts are over here, start strapping them in, Mr. Hughes, Nox and I will help you secure yourself before you clamp on to the line."

Everyone start grabbing harnesses and the chatter started.  I stood before the only girl in the class, "Hi, what's your name?"  

I started wrapping the straps around her as she smiled up at me, "Elena."

I grinned, "Like the Vampire Diaries, very nice."  I gave her an mock appalled look, "You don't drink blood do you?"

She giggled, "No sir."  I finished tightening her belts and she moved on to the line.  I moved to Levi who was helping a little boy.  I knelt down before him and smiled, "What's your name?"

He whispered shyly.  "Charles."

"We have our own Professor X."

The boy frowned, he didn't catch my reference.  Levi was shaking his head.

All the kids were strapped in and attached to the safety line. It was time to conquer my fear again.  Like I did each and every time I jumped from the building.  Heights, whodathunk that was my greatest physical fear.  I had others, but this, this one I could conquer.  And I did.

I stepped up on the ledge and peired over the edge and felt the fear run up my spine.  I swallowed hard and turned around.  It was always easier not watching the ground gain speed towards my face.  Watching the sky fall away was so much easier.

I wrapped all the elements around me.  Fire and water were only there for show, this was all about the show, not the actual jump itself.  I had free reign to show off.  I heard the kids ooh and ahh as I fell backwards and wings of air slowed my decent.  I could float like a feather to the ground if I so chose, but I liked the free fall, the air rushing past my ears.  It was 8 seconds.  8 seconds of pure bliss - it was almost heaven.

The ground caught me in a softened cradle of my own devising.  I knew exactly when and how to do it, I didn't need to see it.  If gravity were to one day change on me I was going to become a pancake.  But the chances of that happening was slight.  

I lay on the ground for several moments looking up at the blue hazy sky of New York City.  It wasn't nearly as pretty as something in the mountains, but it was home.  I felt more at ease here than I did in the great outdoors.  I was pretty sure I was going to ask to stay, even if that meant I had to teach.  But there was always hunts in the City, in every city.

I sat up and eventually pulled myself to standing and started for the alley way that held the entrance back inside.  As I turned the corner I found the door open and a familiar face was waiting as he propped the door open with his body.  I grinned, "Hey."

He smiled, "Hey back.  You enjoy that?"

I nodded emphatically as I stopped in front of Dorian, "It's almost heaven."

Dorian grinned, "Almost heaven?  If that's not heaven, what is?"

I chuckled, "I'm sure I could show you sometime."  I winked suggestively and I watched a small hint of color wash up on the bronzed skin of the man before me.

Dorian waved me inside and I stepped inside and turned back to face him as the door closed behind him.  "I need to get back up there."  I nodded towards the roof.

Dorian closed the distance between us.  He hesitated a moment before he put his hand on my arm.  I could feel my heart flutter as he touched me.  He smiled and I felt home, more home than I had in ages.  "I'd really like to talk with you about patterns."  Why touch me for that?  Was he flirting?  Damn I wished I could read past my own self right now.

I nodded my words failing me.  I swallowed and put on my innocent grin, "Alright.  Whenever is convenient for you.  I've got a billion and one things to do, but no specific order they have to be done in."

Dorian nodded, "Later tonight?  I have a dinner with a new employee and then I'm free."

I took a deep breath as I nodded, Dorian smiled at me with that knowing smile.  I spoke slowly, "Sounds good.  Stop by my room.  I should be there.  We can find someplace quiet to talk I'm sure."

Dorian smiled and pulled his hand away brushing along my arm as he headed up the stairs.  I was reading too much into this.  I had to be.  I watched as Dorian headed up the stairs.  My heart was still pounding and I wasn't sure if it was due to the jump or from Dorian's touch, either way, I was enjoying the way Dorian made me feel.  Though I knew it was a dangerous game to play.  I had to push the thoughts away.  Why would he be interested?

I took the stairs up two at a time until I grew tired.  I made it about half way up.  It wasn't that I was out of shape but it was a long way up.  

I opened the door to the roof and I could hear the chatter of the children as Jace was trying to get things settled.  I heart Charles explaim, "He bent all four elements at the same time."

The moment one of them noticed me they all ran towards me and started chattering away at me with such enthusiasm it was hard not to get swept up in it.  But I couldn't hear half of what they said.  It was a din of chaos, but it was so full of hope and Jace took it upon himself to calm things down, "Leave the man be," he laughed.  "Come on let's go back to class and discuss what we saw calmly."

They all got in their neat little line all still looking at me with wide eyes and I knew then that I wanted to do that again. Wanted to share what I had to offer.  Jace clapped me on the back, "Good job man.  Inspiration done.  Thanks a lot bro."

I smiled widely at Jace, "No problem. Anytime."

Jace lead the group downstairs and Levi looked at me expectantly, I grinned at him, "Go ahead.  I'll catch up on some work.  Stay with Jace.  I'll come get you later."  He nodded and headed after the younger class.  Maybe he'd do well with them.  Maybe it would straighten him out.  I could only hope so.



# The First Death
_Monday, June 15, 2015 1:00PM_

I was left alone on top of the roof.  It had been a long time since I'd been up here, and even longer since I'd been completely alone.  Once people caught word I was jumping I usually had a pile of people joining me for the spectical of it all or to jump themselves.  

I had missed the scenic view, I could see for miles and miles up here.  I could do that in the mountains, but I was never without my two feet on the ground.  Here it felt different.  I don't know what it was but I realy missed this.  I took a deep breath and closed my eyes and absorbed home.  

I had to make myself walk into the door and down the stairs to the Archives.  I had work to do.  

The Archives were much the same as they had been when I left yesterday, the biggest change was a distinct lack of Mrs. Vega.  I would have liked to see her sparkling green eyes and her bright smile before heading into work.  I knew it was a replacement for what I wanted.  And I was sure Margo would have a field day with that information.

I followed the same path we had taken earlier and I found the room empty, the lights off.  I opened the door and reached inside and fumbled for the light switch that I knew was there.  The lights flickered on with their sickly yellow light illuminating the walls and rows of books and the lone table in the room.  

I shut the door behind me and sat down at the table and browsed the books that were already out.  Sure enough they had been records of the Viddens and Vegas.  I flipped through the most recent volumes.  I wished for Dorian's photographic memory as I tried to remember the dates of the cases that had been the most interesting.

There was a knock at the door and a small girl of about sixteen came in sulking and frowning as she dropped a folder on my table.  "I was told to give these to you."  She sneered and stood there like I was expected to do something.

I smiled brightly at her and she blushed as she scampered off in the direction she'd come.  I sighed, I wished they'd make up their mind as whether or not they hated me or were in love wih the idea of the bad boy I proclaimed myself as.  It was tiring.

I took a look through the new files and saw that it was exactly what I had been looking for.  I wondered if this was Dorian's or his mother's handy work.  But it really didn't matter.  I now had the names of the two families that were exiled by Kai and Emilio.

I got up from the table and walked to the far corner with the names of the familes jotted down on my phone's note app so I didn't forget them.  

It took me a while to find the right records for the families, they were intermingled with other things cases in that year.  And with the records always changing the binders were always growing, or the books were being repirnted with added information when the spines grew too large for the added pages.

Ironically I also found Levi's family in one of the binders that one family was in.  Exiled around the same time.  I glanced through the Hughes files briefly taking note that they'd left voluntarily not exiled.  That could explain a lot.  But that was for later.

I sat down with the two volumes and the records and I really couldn't find anything of note.  These two familes had no Magnus going as far back as I could trace.   I had to even rummage around in tomes so old that I was afraid every page turn was going to rip the pages.

I glanced at the time on my phone and found that it was far later than I'd thought.  I didn't have time to pounder long as I heard the sirens go off.  There was a fire - but it wasn't a fire that required evacuation.  The siren's were different, this was an elemental fire typically a fire starter or an accident.

I listened to the pattern of the siren and knew exactly where it was.  It was in the adult residences, that was odd.  Unless a bomb went off.  I scrambled out of my chair and I headed to the third floor of the adult residences where the alrms said the fire was.  

As I neared I knew exactly where I was going, only the Vegas lived in the direction of the pandamonium I was seeing around me as I jogged towards the location of the alarm.

I rounded the courner and I saw Emilio wrapped around Dorian's tall muscular frame.  It was really an interesting contrast.  Their Spanish decent was apparent between the two of them, but where Dorian was only an inch shorter than I was, Emilio was two or three shorter than Dorian.  He was wider and far less pretty than his son.  But they were kin there was no doubt about it.  

My admiriation soon faded as I took a step inside the room and saw a charred corpse of a woman.  I swallowed hard.  Mrs. Vega...

I turned back to the Vegas outside in the hall just as Sahara joined Dorian and their father.  She was wearing nothing but a sports bra and gym shorts, and she looked winded like she'd just run up the stairs from where ever she had been.

She gave me a frown and put her hand on her father's shoulder and his tears fell even harder and faster and my heart lept for him.  I wished I could do something.  Mr. Vega wrapped his arms around Sahara and she comforted him.  It was awkward watching the family dynamic.  Dorian looked at me and I gave him a sad smile.  I wanted to go to him to let him cry, but I had to see more.  I nodded to Dorian to indicate I was going in, he nodded knowingly as he put his hand on his father's shoulder and turned his attention back to the family.

I walked inside and Kai was standing there yelling at the fire squad.  "I don't care just get out."

I had no idea what he was yelling about and I tried to ignore him.  I looked at the blast radius and the disarray of the perfect house.  It had been perfect, now a charred blast circle and the corpse of a woman I'd spoke to only a few hours ago lay on the carpet.  I fought the bile and tears that threatened to reveal my emotions.  This was going to stay with me a while.

"Another package?"  I asked to no one imparticular.

Kai didn't look at me he only nodded.  He was trying not to get angry at me, I could tell by the way he clenched his jaw and the fire and earth moved around him.  He looked at me with questions in his eyes, I smiled and cocked my head waiting for him to ask.  It took him a while to find the right words, maybe he was trying not to yell I don't know.  I didn't know the man well enough.  "Any residual affects?  Something someone else might miss?"

I shook my head, "I don't think so.  The patterns are still here, dissipating quickly without their cohesion they are slipping back into their natural states.  If someone were more adept at forensics they might be able to peice it together.  I've never tried to."

Kia nodded, "Can you try?"

I shrugged.  "Yeah I guess."  I started pulling the scattered patterns to me and finding the missing peices.  I sat there for an indeterminate amount of time as my father watched me.  I wondered what was going through his head.  

I shook my head, "No, they are going too fast, I put one together and another dissipates.  I'm not fast enough."  

Dorian from the doorway asked with sadness in his voice, "You think it's a limit of yours?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I don't think it's a physical reaction time.  We'd need to slow the decay rate.  I don't know how to do that."

Kai nodded, "At least you tried."  

He looked at me and headed out the door with a slight nod.  It was better than I had expected from him.   I turned and noticed that it had grown dark.  What time was it?

Dorian looked at me, I could see the saddness in his eyes.  I closed the distance between us and whispred to him, "I'm so sorry."  He gave me a weak smile.  I put my hand on his arm and he relaxed under my touch.  I could wrap him in a hug, and be the rock he needed like he'd been so many times for me, but that was not Dorian.  Dorian was strong in the face of anything.  There were no tears, just glassy eyes rimmed in red.  He looked sad but he had not let loose yet.  He did not break down.  

I remembered the day my mother had died.  It wasn't in the cave that she'd been attacked in, no it was an Infirmary much like the one Nick was in right now.  Except there was nothing they could do now.  Even Venatori are not immune to the venom of a were creature, but she was just human.  While they don't turn on the full moon, it is one of few venoms that override the antibodies that allow them to heal quickly, it's not quick enough.  It was almost like lycanthropy (and vampirism for that matter) were designed just to kill Venatori. 

I remembered watching my mother writhe in agony from the window outside her room.  She didn't want anything to do with me.  I could hear her blaming me for the pain when the nurses left the room.  My heart sank each time.  That was my mother, and that was how she felt about me.  She died from the transition from human to werebear.  She survived the birthing of a half Venatori child but couldn't survive the change.  Ironic.

I had to push the thoughts from my head.  I whispered to Dorian, "I don't think these are coming from the mail room.  I think there's an inside man.  Nick mentioned a kid gave him the package."

I took Dorian's hand and pulled him away from the crowd and into the hall around the corner.  It wasn't that I cared if someone overherad but I knew Dorian would.  "If you need anything, for you or your family.  Let me know."

Dorian nodded, my heart went out to him.  He'd just lost his mother and he was trying to put on a good face. "You already are doing more than necessary.  I don't think ..."  Dorian hesitated a moment.  "still up for discussing patterns later?"

I was shocked to think he still wanted to do that.  But that he felt I was better company than his own head, maybe there was hope.  I nodded, "Sure thing, anything you need.  I'm going to hit the mail room and give the orders myself.  And scan what I can while it's there.  I'll see you later."

Dorian nodded, "Later it is then."

I patted Dorian's arm as I walked past him, I wanted to hold him, tell him it would get easier, but I didn't want to step past my bounds.  I walked away from Dorian and Emilio stepped in pace with me and nodded, "Come with me."

I blinked at him and nodded.  I wasn't sure what was going on.  We walked out of his home in silence.  I walked with Mr. Vega down cooridor after cooridor and waited for some indication of what was going on.  The silence was unbearable, "I'm sorry for your loss."

Emilio stopped and turned to look at me.  I couldn't tell what he was feeling or thinking.  He looked so much like Dorian yet, he was harder, the fine lines of Dorian's face were not present but he was his father's son.  I watched as emotions played across his face, the man before me was always so strong, he was at a loss right now.  The man stared at me, seeing through me, and I felt like squirming under the scruty.  He eventually nodded, coming to terms with whatever had plagued his mind as I said my condolances, "Thank you."

Strangly Emilio put his hand around my shoulder and he pulled me back towards the direction we'd been going.  We walked in silence a few more steps before Emilio added, "Your father..."

I didn't want to hear the next phrases but I didn't say anything.  "Your father is calling an all hands meeting.  He asked me to bring you with me.  To scavenge through the video footage.  I found it ironic that he'd ask you considering his venomous outrage at your being here in the first place."  He patted my shoulder, "You've grown on him I think.

I laughed, "I don't know about that.  He thinks it's an inside man too?"

Emilio laughed, "I would say the two of you were two peas in a pod but if Kai heard me I'm sure he'd disavow any friendship we ever had."

I grinned.  "Nick said a kid handed him the package.  The one on Kai's counter wasn't delivered by the mailroom.  We could check that footage, and the hand off of Nick's, and back track to see when Mrs. Vega got hers."

Emilio nodded, "Smart boy.  That's what we are going to do.  We have a lot of footage to sweep.  Though seeing Nicholas was probably not very smart.  There are certain things that Kai blames you for."

I nodded, "Nick and I discussed the biggest issue.  Nick was gay before I met him."

Emilio nodded, "I know that, and Nick knows this, but it's highly ironic that both of our youngest boys are ..."

I grinned, "Gay?  And Kai has me to offset things even worse."

Emilio nodded, "Yes, he is not happy you and Nick got caught."

I laughed, "Imagine if we hadn't."

Emilio paled.  "I didn't think of it that way, and I honestly don't think Kai has either.  If Dae'lin hadn't caught you things could have been worse off."

I grinned at the best friend of my father, "Oh it would have been a grand night.  Worse thinking about it but damn it woulda been fun."

Emilio actually blushed.  I chuckled to myself mostly as Emilio shook his head, "You really do like to abuse that knowledge don't you?  That's what Kai hates you know.  You are everything he is and was and no one likes you for it."

I smiled, "That has nothing to do with being Kai's son.  I push people away.  It's what I do."

Emilio nodded knowingly, "Not everyone."

It was my turn to blush.  Emilio waved it off.  "My boy will find his own way.  These new regulations are playing havoc on his soul.  He needs someone."

I grinned, "Well... "

Emilio paused in front of a door and opened it.  In side was a darkly light room with a ton of monitors, Security room # X. I didn't know the actually number but they all had numbers.

The guard looked up and nodded.  There was no exchange of words he already knew he needed to step out - two hunters meant business.  It was interesting seeing the default line of heirarchy play out in the NYC compound.  I had missed the way it worked together unlike the one in Boulder.

Emilio sat down and I took the other chair, I asked, "Do you want to start in front of the apartment, or at her work?"

Emilio waved me off, "You start at the apartment I'll watch her at work."

I nodded and started looking for the cameras in front of the Vega's apartment.  This was going to be a long night.# Hunting the Inside Man
_Monday, June 15, 2015 6:30PM_

The camera in front of the apartment was still running, and I let it continue with its normal routine as I started running the recorded feeds backwards.  I blinked as I saw the explosion through the door, or rather under the door.  It made my heart stop and my body felt drained.  I couldn't imagine what had happened.  Or what had killed Mrs. Vega.  I had to push the thoughts away as I ran through the feed backwards.  It was such an odd feeling watching the door knowing that the woman I was looking for to emerge from her home was dead now.

As I sat there waiting, knowing what happened my phone rang and I jumped at the sound.  I pulled my phone from my pocket and answered, "Hello?"  I tried to pay attention to both things but I knew things we going to get hard.  

A small voice chattered at "Uh... hello?"

Soon the chattering stopped and it was just dead air.  "Sorry, Hey Nox. Aidan stole the phone as you I called you."

I grinned, "No problem.  I was a little worried.  I'm surprised you called."

Stella sighed, "Yeah bout that.  I'm sorry.  I am not good at this."

I laughed, "Neither am I."

"So friends okay?"

I sighed, "Yeah, it'll do.  How'd the interview go?"  I promptly changed the subject I didn't want to dwell on what had happened.  Or on the fact that this little woman wanted to be my friend.  She hardly knew me.  Hardly knew the person I was.  She just met me.  I could feel my mood plummetting, but I focused on her.

Stella laughed, "I got the job.  I can't believe it.  I talked with her for like ten minutes, and then she offered me the job.  There is a dinner meeting tonight, which will determine whether or not I take it I guess.  Apparently there is a lot of information I need to know beforehand. I get to meet some big wigs."

"I'm glad you got it.  When do you start?"  It sounded real good, almost too good to be true.

"Two weeks."  Stella sounded ecstatic.  "I fly home tomorrow and I'll be back in a week.  They are going to show me places tonight too.  I'm really in shock. I want to celebrate, but I don't think I have time before I fly back home.  Maybe after I get back you can show me around town in celebration."

Emilio cleared his throat and I nodded, "Yeah sure.  But right now I can't talk.  I have an important task at hand and my partner in crime here is not liking me talking right now."

"Oh, that's alright.  I have to get ready for dinner and Aidan's things together.  I should have called earlier, but I was so excited I called my Mom and we talked for hours."

To have that close a relationship with a parent was not something I understood.  Though Jace, he and his family were close.  I'm surprised he stayed here instead of going back home to the south.

"Sounds like fun.  Call me when you land tomorrow so I know you got home alright."

"Sure thing.  I'll talk to you tomorrow then."  Stella didn't wait for a goodbye, or anything as the phone call went dead.

I sighed, "Sorry about that."

Emilio turned with a smile, "Girlfriend?"

I shook my head, "No, I barely know her." I stared at the monitor in front of me watching it in reverse at double speed.  "She's human, sweet and all.  Not the type of girl you love and leave with a child on her hip."

Emilio paused his feed, "You don't want to be with a human?  Are they just toys for you?"  From anyone else I would have taken it another way, but he was the father of a man who'd cared for me most of my life.  He had to get it from somewhere.

"They aren't toys.  I don't have a problem sleeping with a human girl, but I have a problem with accidents killing a mother."

Emilio nodded, "Ah, the inevitable truth of your birth haunts you."

I pause the feed and turn to Emilio, "I like her.  She's sweet, a good mother.  And she only wants to be friends.  She likes to probe, she found out I like guys and that I have the hots for one in particular."

Emilio chuckled, "And it comes down to someone else."  He chuckled again but he said nothing as he turned back to his screens.

I started my screen again and we watched in silence.  I watched as Mrs. Vega emerged from the door with a package in her hand.  I sighed, "She had the package before she came home."

I started watching backwards until I lost sight of her and paused the syncronious feeds, "You know the cameras better than I do, maybe you should run this one now?"

Emilio laughed, "We all have our specialties."

I nodded, "And mine is not this."  I grinned at him as I moved my chair to the side and let him have the controls.  He quickly and easily found the next camera to follow and we watched as she walked backwards with the package in question.  I had plenty of time to study it.  It looked like it had come from the mailroom.  The stamps were the same, but that was easily enough to fake.

"We should get a list of employees who have been new in the past few months to see if we can find any coorelations."

Emilio nodded, "Send your father that message.  He can handle it."

"You think he'll listen to me?"

Emilio laughed and handed me his phone.  "Use mine.  No smiley faces or anything or he'll know it's not me."

I wouldn't do that anyway, but I nodded as I found Kai's contact in there and started a text, "Stamps all look official.  A list of mailroom employees over the course of the past few months might yield some help.  Any missing equipment too."

I read the text to Emilio and he nodded, "Good thinking."  I hit send and off it went I handed the senior Vega his phone back and continued watching.

We followed Mrs. Vega through her life backward to the best of our ability.  And we eventually hit what we were looking for, the moment she was handed a package, from a kid wearing a White Sox hat.  And that was about all we could tell about the person.  He was wearing jeans.  We had an exact time now.  We could coorolate times of every person in the compound now.  We had much more information to go on.

"Do we need to search Nick's receipt of the package?  Or Kai's delivery?"

Emilio shook his head.  "We could search Kai's place but I suspect it's the same kid, the hat was seen at the hand off for Nicolas, Kai and I already searched."

"So we need to look for the hat then."  Emilio nodded.

"We should go find Kai.  He'll want in on this."  I nodded with a sigh, Emilio put a hand on my shoulder, "It'll be alright he's doing better with you here, the way you handled the bomb was impressive I think."

I scoffed, "I'm sure it's because I didn't blow him up."

Emilio gave a strained laughed as we headed to the common area where Kai was holding the all hands meeting.

As we neared the common area my stomach growled at the smell of the evening meal finishing up.  I realized at that moment I hadn't eaten anything except for that one bite I'd taken before Aaron tossed my food to the ground in one swift push.  We passed a vending machine and I grabbed a dry protein bar.  I didn't particularly like these things but it would help me finish off the rest of my day.

We found Kai just as I finished chewing the last bite of the dry food I'd forced into my gullet.  Kai glared at me, he looked like he was ready to spit nails, but he didn't say anything.

Before Kai could say anything or get angry at either one of us I spat out, "Emilio and I saw the same kid with the Sox hat give Mrs. Vega a package."

"Whoever owns that hat we need to find them."  Kai said rather blandly.

I nodded, "Yeah we do."

My father blinked at me, I think he was confused as we agreed on a course of action.  It was not something we'd done as of yet.  Kai looked like he was waiting for something bad to happen.  Or for me to make a smart ass comment.  Or maybe say something stupid.  I must have disappointed him because he frowned, and then he turned away from me.  I felt my heart drop.  I don't know why but it did, whatever it was it hurt.

Emilio and Kai started walking in the direction of the dormitories.  Kai looked back at me and nodded, "Well come on, we need all the help we can get.  Tell Dae'lin we will start in the dormintories.  She can wrangle others for the adult residences."

I nodded.  Emilio added, "Sahara and Eli are joining us in the dormitories.  I texted them while you were making eyes at your son."  That earned Emilio a glare and I was thankful that Kai didn't see my smirk.

Kai nodded, "I'll have the rest of mine joins us in the dorimitories as well."

With the plans laid, I sent Dae'lin a text detailing our plan of action as we walked through the common area to the boys dormintory.  Emilio added, "We should start in the boys.  Nick says it was a boy that gave it to him.  Highschool age."

Kai glanced back at me as I tried to ignore their conversation.  He looked back at Emilio and nodded in my direection, "_He_ tell you that?  I know I never said anything."

Emilio laughed, "Yes, Kai he did.  We've had a grand talk about many things.  Leave him be."

Kai sighed, "Fine."  He muttered, "He has been useful."

I looked up but neither of them were looking at me.  The prior heart dropping was redemed, this man was going to be the death of me - the ups and the downs were not helping.

As I ran through the facts around in my head.  Something was missing and I couldn't but my finger on it.  Some connection that I needed to make. It pulled at my memory like a moth to the flame.

The boy's dorimitory was in an uproar by time we reached the double doors that lead to their common room.  Mr. Lance greeted us with a smile.  He'd been with the Academy for more years than any of us had been alive, every boy who stepped into these doors had come under the care of Mr. Lance.  All three of us paid the man his just due.  He was a simple man and he always looked liked he'd been rustled from bed.

Mr. Lance sounded annoyed as he asked, "Do we have to do this?  Now?  We were in the middle of dinner."

Emilio stepped away from them and put his arm around the older gentle man.  I wondered how old Mr. Lance was, he had to be pushing 80 at least.  "It is best that we do it now.  The boys and yourself are welcome to go back to the cafeteria and finish.  It might be better."

I laughed and the three older men looked at me.  I explained my outburst. "Would you let someone rummage through your things without your presence? I know I wouldn't."

Kai nodded, "The boy's right."  He looked at me and in a much louder voice, spoke to the common area,  "We will do this as quickly and as orderly as possible.  Everyone standing outside their rooms.  Do not enter or go in until one of the venatori are there."

It wasn't long before Sahara and Eli entered through the same double doors that we'd come through. Emilio sent them down the right cooridor.  After they left Emilio gave Mr. Lance instructions for the Vidden's children to go down the center cooridor.  We were going down the left.  Each group got a master key.  With each of the kids there it was unlikely we would actually need them.

There were about 20 halls down each cooridor with between 1 to four children in them.  The first two doors in each cooridor was painted orange and that was were I stopped in my tracks.  I stared at the door feeling my panic rise.  The dormintories were not the same as the class rooms.  But an orange door was still an orange door.

Kai put his hand on my shoulder and I jumped.  My heart was pounding and I knew beads of sweat had formed on my forehead.  "Bad memories for me too."

He said nothing else and opened the door to show me there was no one in the room.  The bunks were empty of everything.  No sheets, no blankets, nothing.  But I went in anyway and looked in all the possible hiding spots.  It was possible to have left things here even if you didn't stay here.  But I found nothing.

I moved on.  I wondered how much my father actually suspected why it bothered me, it wasn't for what he thought, not because of the fires I'd started, or even the bullying I received as a child.  It was all about fear.  My worst nightmares come alive.  I swallowed that fear and moved on to the next door.

Well the third door on my side of the cooridor.  Kai had one side, I had another and Emilio was going between both sides one ahead of us each time.

The first room had four bunks and all four were perfectly dishevealed from the morning wake up call.  I grinned as I looked around.  There were no baseball hats lying around in plain sight, more the pity.  I really wasn't looking forward to trashing someone's room.  So I started looking in the more open spaces at first - under the bed, in drawers and closets.  I used my gift to see if there were any thing being concealed.  I found nothing in the first room.  

I glanced in Kai's room and found he was being a bit more throrough.  But Emilio's handy worked was less messy.  A few over turned books here and there.  But not a mess that Kai left.  

When we reached the end of the cooridor Kai had found three white sox caps.  Emilio and I had not been so fortunate.  Or unfortunate, depending on how you looked at it.  But to our benefit, all of Kai's hats had been hanging on the bunks in plain sight.

The Vega children found one hat and Kai's children had found none.  It made me feel slightly better at having found none. All the boys were detained and sent to the office floors for interrogating.  I felt bad for the boys.  But it was necessary, even I understood this.  Discomfort of the few for the greater benefit of the whole.

Their search had taken close to two hours to finish, in that time two girls were found by some of Dae'lin's reconosense groups.  There were also a baker's dozen of adult residences that had been found with a White Sox hat in their possessions.  There was no telling how many suspects they had now, the number of adults could vary from two per residence to upwards of six and seven depending on the living situation.  The Venatori adults liked to bunk together as they didn't exactly stay at HQ much.  You never knew who was in town and who was not.  It was going to be a mess.

The entirity of the residential search took two hours.  Two hours for everyone who lived in this building to endured an invasion of their privacy.  We could only hope it bore fruit.

I was starving now.  I could feel my stomach rumble, I knew others could hear it too.  But there was still work to do.  Each person needed to be asked about their wearabouts, why they had the hat, and determine if they were cesari.  I could easily do that.  And I did.  I looked at each person carefully.

There was about 64 people that I had to look at, but it was fairly simple to do.  I could tell from a glance that none of them where cesari.  I wrote down a persons name and their desigation by what I saw  I only asked each person their name.

I noticed that Aaron was there.  He looked angry.  He looked out of place and like he should have been one of the intergogators instead of being interogated.  I smiled at him as I took in his pattern.

In addition to their name and designation I drew a simplistic pattern around them that maybe someone else could see later.  It took a lot longer than I'd have liked.  But when I was done I took my notes to Dae'lin.  "This is about all I can do to help with the interogation."

She took the paper from me and glanced at each one, "What's this?  We already know this."

I smiled.  "I only asked them their name.  I drew a simplistic pattern I see around them, and what designation that tells me a person is.  I'd be interested in seeing how wrong I am.  But I can't help anymore."  My stomach took that oppurtunity to growl loudly.  

Loud enough Dae'lin frowned at me. "When did you eat last?"

I laughed, "Honestly, I've not had a decent meal all day.  Aaron decided my breakfast was not good enough to eat as it landed on the floor.  I had a power bar not long ago." I shook my head, "I know, not good, I got distracted with everything.  I'll go eat now unless you need me?"

Dae'lin nodded, "You've given me your insight I think we are good.  Go eat."  Dae'lin looked at her watch, "Cafeteria is done with dinner, won't be much left I'm sure."

"Yeah I know.  I'll manage.  Even if that means running to the store to get food to make."  

Dae'lin laughed, "I forget you actually like cooking."

I grinned, "It's not so much as like as it's a necessity I learned to do so I didn't have to eat in the cafeteria all the time."

Dae'lin gave me a small shove in the direction of the door.  "Go eat before your stomach chews its way out of your belly."

I laughed a I quickly snuck into the stairwell and headed towards my room.  I wondered how trashed it was.# Caught on Fire
_Monday, June 15, 2015 10:45PM_

    "Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable." -- Bruce Lee

I got to my room and found the door wide open and my things strewn all over the place.  How lovely.  My gun was sitting out in the open left for just anyone to come in and fire.  I sighed as I put it back in the bottom of my bag.  My bathroom was trashed.  All the clean white fluffy towels were laying in a heap on the floor.  Everything was mess.

I set to folding the towels.  My OCD was kicking in.  Dae'lin's perfection grated on my nerves, but then again I'd become so accustomed to it I hardly noticed when it was my training versus my own neurocies anymore.  

A knock came at the door I'd left open.  A familiar voice called out, "Nox, you here?"

I smiled to myself, and my heart started to race.  I shouted from the bathroom.  "Yeah, come on in to the disaster area."

Dorian walked in and stood in the doorway to the bathroom and leaned against the frame.  He watched me as I finished folding the towels and put them in the linen closet.  "Seems my room was searched rather throughly."

Dorian gave me a sympathetic yet strained smile, "Mine wasn't nearly so bad.  But then again I'm certain that I was treated rather kindly due to the circumstances."

I frowned but when I looked up to see Dorian's face he was still putting on a feigned smile.  But the smile quickly faded and left small lines of worry that etched into his beautiful face.  Death among the Venatori was not uncommon, but this was a tragedy.  

I grinned at Dorian trying to lighten the mood as I leaned against the bathroom door, it gave a little under my weight and I had to shift my feet ungraceful like.  "I'm sure they were down right nice to you."

I waved Dorian into the studio proper. There was no point standing in the bathroom, where my mind was wandering to various things I'd like to be doing.  Things I rapidly pushed from my mind.  "I'm starving.  I need to go get something to eat.  If you don't mind coming with, we can talk on the way over, over dinner and find someplace to finish talking about what I see."

Dorian nodded, "I think that will work.  I know a nice little place, if you don't mind."

I laughed,  "Didn't you just come from a work dinner?"

Dorian nodded, "Yeah but the food was several hours ago.  But the wine is good and I can go for desert."

I nodded and smiled.  "If that's what you want."  

Dorian looked down and saw one of my shirts that had been tossed unceremoniously on the floor.  He picked it up and chuckled to himself as he tossed it to me. "Nice shirt."

I uncurled it from my fingers and snickered, "One of my favorites."

Dorian smirked through the sorrow.  "I'd hit that," Dorian colored slightly as he recited the words on the offensive t-shirt.  It was of course referencing a pinata, but meant so much more than that.  When Dorian saw I was watching him, his blush deepend, but it quckly changed to a frown as he walked past me.  Something was bothering him, and it wasn't the death of his mother.  I swallowed hard and tried not to show my fustration or my need.  Margo's words rang in my head, "You need to let someone in."  Dorian was in as far as anyone had ever gotten, if I opened the door more and he rejected me I'd be worse off.  Fear lanced through my body and I fought to push it back and headed towards the door, following Dorian out of my apartment.

Dorian started for the stairs and I chuckled softly, "We can take the elavator, you know."

Dorian laughed, "Habit, I suppose."

I shook my head, "You take the stairs out of habit?"

Dorian kept walking as he answered, "When I'm with you, yes."  He frowned, "I didn't like the way it envoked fear in you.  It's nothing to take the stairs when I'm in your company."  And there it was again.  I wish I knew what was bothering him about me.  But it didn't matter, there was little hope in anything if he was pulling away.  I should give up now before I make myself crazy.  I focused on the topic, not on the person.  Maybe that would help.  I did like talking about myself.

"You do realized that I broke the dread of heights when I was eight years old, at your suggestion if you recall."

Dorian nodded, "Yes, but by then I'd had it ingrained into me.  Those first years saw you in my office more times than I can count.  Dae'lin having had to adjust to you as much as you to her.  I expect the same of Levi and you."

"Well if he's got as much potential as you think he does, then I'm sure we'll butt heads a few times.  How did your dinner go?"  I asked to change the topic.

We stopped on landing.  Dorian hesitated.  "I think that is something you should be sitting for."

I laughed, "I'm not going to fall down, no matter what you say.  I think I can walk.  You can't say that and not tell me now."  I winked at Dorian.

Dorian sighed but continued the descent down the stairs, "The lovely lady who Dae'lin has hired I think you might know."

"Seriously?"  I shook my head, "Stella was here in the building this morning?"

Dorian nodded, "Yes.  She was guaranteed the job."

Now I was confused, "Why?  She didn't seem to think so."

Dorian turned a slight shade of red, it was a cute look on the tanned skinned man.  "I told her mother it was an interview, but the job was hers no matter what if she came to interview for it."

We walked down an entire flight of stairs with our foot steps being the only sound until Dorian continued, "This whole progeny thing threw me for a loop.  To see if I could bring myself to do what was necessary I left my station for a few months to find someone I could try... to... with."

I grinned, "You mean you went to Denver to find a girl to sleep with?"

Dorian nodded, "Put bluntly, yes.  I found a girl I could," Dorian's blush deepened, "with.  She was sweet and kind and young enough that my," he paused searching for a word.  I didn't interrupt I didn't realy know what he was grasping for.  He finally continued, "inexperience wouldn't be overly weird."

"Inexperience, Dorian I seriously doubt that.  With a girl maybe, but you are hardly inexperienced." 

Dorian chuckled, "And you know this, how?"

I could feel the blood rushing to my ears, "An educated guess."

We reached the main landing and started for the door of the stair well.  Dorian opened the door and put his hand on the small of my back and guided me through the door a step ahead of him.  I could feel a shiver run up my spine from his touch.  I had to swallow the sound that threatened to escape my mouth at his singular touch. My mind was reeling, I was more than confused. 

Dorian fell in step with me and continued, "Well I suppose your guess is correct, she never complained or noticed my lack of knowledge. I stayed for two months before I couldn't lie to her anymore.  She was getting serious and I couldn't love her."  Dorian sighed, "The day I told I was leaving, she'd had something to tell me.  She insisted I go first.  When I pressed her, she waved me off but her mother sent me an email bitching me out.  'How could you leave my daughter when she's pregnant with your child?'"

Fuck me!  I closed my eyes, I couldn't imagine that feeling, though I imagined it was painful.  I didn't have to ask how it happened because Dorian answered my unspoken question, "She'd been sick, the condom broke, antibotic and that screwed us pretty good.  We thought things were okay.  But apparently not.    I'd told her mother I didn't love her daughter, but I would help however necessary, through her.  She agreed.  Stella lost her job about a week ago. When she told me, I arranged for Dae'lin to hire her."

"Dae'lin's assistant's time was ending anyway, and with Stella, Dae'lin won't need to replace her for a while.  The meeting last night was informing Stella that her son was different."

I nodded, "And that you were different.  And she was about to become venatori."

Dorian nodded, "Yes.  Her son is likely Magnus.  100% of minorem born to a human mother that both mother and child have surived have been Magnus."

"I know the statistic."

Dorian nodded, "I firgured you would.  You did quite a bit of research on your past if I recall."

"Only on that, not curious enough to find out who my father was."  I gave a hesitant laugh, I really hadn't cared back then to find out who my father was.

Dorian nodded, "Yes, there is that.  If I'd known you'd met Stella, I wouldn't have made the suggestion for yesterday."

I frowned, "Why not?  You expected me to sleep with her?"

Dorian's sharp laugh made me jump. "Actually yes.  I didn't expect the child to inhibit your natural inclination."

I smiled, "Seems I still have a few surprises left."

"You do at that."  Dorian lead the way through the large double doors of the building and headed for the subway platform around the corner.  We didn't chat much while we caught the D train heading towards Little Italy.  Despite the hour it was relatively full, it seemed everyone piled into this one car.  There was standing room only.  Which wasn't a bother really.

Dorian chose a spot near the rear of the car and used the strap to keep his balance. The car lurched to a start and I had no choice but to grab the same one.  The motion of the car pressed Dorian's hip into the front of me.  We were close enough to whisper.  I could smell his crisp clean scent of cinnamon and vanilla - a perfect safe zone.  I could feel Dorian's breath on my cheek before he whispered, "I didn't plan this honest."

I chuckled, "I wouldn't have minded if you had."  I really wouldn't have, I could feel his body heat through my hoodie and jeans and I wanted to touch the man next to me.  I really needed to get this crap out of my system somehow.  Dorian looked down and the rest of the way was an uncomfortable silence.

15 minutes later I was nearly breathless from his touch.  I wanted to touch him more but Dorian hurried through the turn stiles and headed up the stairs to the street.  I followed but not nearly as closely as I had earlier.

The air outside felt crisp and cool compared the to stuffy heated air of the underground subway system.  Dorian headed towards Mulberry Street.  I caught up with him but my heart wasn't in the game anymore.  Dorian wasn't interested.  He was too conflicted by something.

We rounded the corner and there were any number of food joints on Mulberry Street, it was after all Little Italy, for which I was actually grateful for. I'd missed good Italian food when I was out west.  I could get great Mexican food, but Italian, not so much.

We past several little places that would have suited my tastes just fine, but when we stopped in front of the darkened would-be maroon awning of Pellegrino's I was surprised.  Dorian had fine tastes, but it was a bit too fine for my pay check.  But I didn't object when Dorian opened the door for me, I should have said something.  I felt Dorian's hand slide along the small of my back as I walked in through the door in front of him.  Such a small gesture and I was melting again at his touch.  I was a mess, Dorian was going to drive me crazy and there was nothing I could do to make it go away.  Every little thing he did I was turning upside down and twisting it to fit my insecurities or my longing.  Why the fuck couldn't I straighten myself out?

The hostest greet Dorian with surprise, "Didn't you just leave?"

Dorian nodded, "My friend is hungry, I figured I could use another bottle of wine and keep him company."

She smiled, "Right this way Mr. Vega."

The woman lead us to a table, they were almost at capacity even this late at night.  It was a wonder that the city that never sleeps really was like this even this late at night.  I would have to readjust my expectations of life again if I intended to stay here.

We sat down and the woman left menus with us.  Dorian picked up the wine menu, "You have any preferences?"

I laughed, "I'll trust your judgement, I'm more a beer kinda guy."

Dorian gave me a weak smile, "We can go elsewhere."  He was asking now?  He didn't ask when we walked in here, and I really couldn't complain though I should.  

I shook my head,  "Here is fine.  I missed good Italian food."  I opened the menu and started browsing and I tried not to react the prices on the menu.  But I knew I'd be working this meal off in many ways.   It wasn't uncommon to spend more than I'd like on a date, but this wasn't exactly a date either.

Our waitor came to the table, "I am Miguel, I will be your server today.  Can I start you off with anything?"

Dorian spoke calmly, "We'll have a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  I'll poke at his plate while I wait for desert."  He smiled at me and I couldn't help but laugh.

"You think I'm sharing?" I grinned playfully at Dorian.

Miguel smiled and looked to me expectantly, "Are you ready to order?"

I smiled up at him with my best smile, "Yeah, I'll start off with Mozzarella Della Casa."

"And your meal?" He asked with a slight frown.  Not one to flirt with, I dialed back.

"Pollo Pastore."  I ordered with a little less flair which earned me a smile from Miguel and from Dorian.

Dorian nodded approvingly at my choices when Miguel left Dorian smiled, "Couldn't have done better myself."

I beamed, "Ain't my first rodeo.  Though I do hope they bring something quickly, I'm starving."

Dorian asked, "You forget to eat today?"

"Something like that.  Just busy I didn't think about it." I hadn't thought about it until my stomach rumbled in the presense of Dorian's father, I sighed, "Your father.  He's a power horse.  I don't think I could have picked up directly after...  Not like he did."

There was sadness in Dorian's eyes as he spoke, "He will power through it until it's over and then he'll crash.  I think we all will.  None of us have felt the pain yet, I know I haven't."  Dorian paused and put a litle thought into his words, "How did you manage, when you lost your mother?" It was almost like he didn't know how to ask the question, or was afriad of the answer.

I shrugged, "I wasn't close to my mother.  I got through it with relatively little pain.  I only have guilt for the circumstances really.  If I'd done my job properly, if I'd not let her superior old school philosphy overrule my judgement she'd still be alive.  If Jace were to go, or Dae'lin or even you, that would be something else entirely.  My family is not one of blood."

"I'm family?"  He sounded shocked.

I laughed, "Closest I've come to it anyway."

Dorian sighed, "That doesn't bode well for this..."  He waved his hand over the table, "Whatever this is."

It was my turn to frown.  "This?  If you don't know what this is, and I'm clueless to it as well.  I don't know if we'll ever find out."

Dorian looked at me with pain in his eyes.  There I went shooting off my mouth again.  I looked down at the table and shook my head.  "I'm sorry."

Dorian's hand touched mine and I looked up to see the comforting face I remembered as a child.  "It's not your fault."  

I pulled my hand away.  "You have to stop that, Dorian."

"Stop what?"  It was such an innocent question, and he really didn't seem to understand.

"Stop touching me that way.  Like there could be more."  I wanted to stand up and go but my stomach rumbled and I knew I had to eat.

Dorian frowned, "Nox..."  He hesitated, he wanted to say more, he kept working his mouth trying to form the words.  

But Miguel arrived with a basket of freshly baked bread and I could see the steam rolling off the top and the patterns above the bread, it was all sort of harmonious.  My mouth started to water.  I looked up at Miguel, "You are a god."  I took a peice of bread from the basket before Miguel set it down on the table.  I took a bite and it melted in my mouth.  I was so hungry.

Dorian sighed,  "Don't mind my friend here, he's been starving himself all day just to fit into those lovely jeans of his."

I tried to laugh, instead I choked on the bread I had just bitten into.  The waitor left in a hurry as if he'd gotten more than he bargained for at our table. He probably had. 

Dorian looked down at his hands on the table and fidgetted with his napkin.  I could see the wheels turning while he tried to find the words he'd been searching for but I change the topic, "Do you see the patterns around the bread?"  Something we actually came here to do.

Dorian adjusted in his chair, the interest in the topic peaking his curiousity in a way that my flirting hadn't. I smiled at the fact but I knew it was just a ploy to hide my fustration.  Dorian strained, I could tell he was focusing intently on the cooling bread, he finally nodded, "Yeah, they look like they are dissipating though."

I nodded, "They are cooling down.  That's how it looks around people, except it oscillates, Kai who bends fire and earth, he'll oscillate pretty steadily between attracking fire and earth.  Indicating he actually is as strong in both."

I paused to think about the patterns I'd seen today.  I had noticed alot of changes, the most notable was in Jason, "Jason.  He's changed a little since I was here last.  He is strong in Air and earth, but he's got a little fire and a small oscilation of water now too."

Dorian nodded, "You should sit in his class one day and listen to him speak.  I won't do his theory justice, but it's pretty simple.  If you can train your eye to see the patterns, you can manipulate them all to some degree or another.  You inspired him."

I smiled, "So that means you can manipulate all the elements?"

Dorian shrugged, "Can't teach an old dogs new tricks."

I laughed, "I bet I could teach you a few new tricks."  The innuendo was not lost on either of us, Dorian shifted uncomfortably and the thought made my body stir and my heart flutter faster. _Fuck!_  I was going to have to watch my words now too. "You've seen them far longer than anyone else and say you can only just touch Air.  I think you are your own interferrance."

"Perhaps, but I will stick to my guns."  He looked like he was about to crawl out of skin with discomfort.

I nodded and let it all go.  There was no other option.

Miguel brought out the anti-pasto I had ordered.  He set the plate down in the middle of the table and placed a plate in front of each of us.  Dorian nodded to him in thanks.  The fresh, smoked, buffalo mozzarella, tomato, roasted peppers and basil looked to die for, almost too pretty to eat.  I didn't waste much time taking a bit of the dish to my plate.

A second waitor came bearing gifts. The wine was presented to Dorian and he nodded.  The server poured two glasses and Dorian took small sip and savored it.  I watched Dorian test the wine to his satisfaction.  The man left the bottle sitting on the table.  I took a sip of the wine. I'd never been a fan of wine, but it was fruity.  I couldn't say much more about the wine. 

My stomach took that moment to growl, I didn't wait any longer.  "I'm starving."  I popped a bit into my mouth.  The first bite was exuqisite and I was drooling.  I could have done my Homer impression but not in polite company.  God I was hungry.  

Dorian nibbled at small portion of the anti-pasto he'd taken.  He watched me finish the plate and the basket of fresh bread.  Dorian shook his head in disblief as I was chewing the last bit of crust and looking around for more food with a frown.  "You'd think they starved you for months."

I laughed, "I ... Well that's kinda true.  I have to remember to eat.  I tend to do this a lot."

Dorian shook his head, "We'll have to fix that while you stay here."

I raised an eyebrow, "Oh?"  My heart fluttered and my body reacted to the thought of Dorian fixing things.  I pushed away the feelings and all the mixed signals just as the waitor showed up bearing my dinner.

Miguel brought out the plate of chicken, it looked decedant.  My mouth started to water again as the man placed the new plate in front of me.   He deftly took the other plates away and asked, "More bread?"

I grinned up at our waitor, "Yes, please."

Dorian poured another glass of wine for himself.  I realized I had hardly touched mine, but then again I had an empty stomach too.  I took a small sip and smiled before I broke into he chicken on my plate.  

Dorian nibbled ever so patiently on a peice of bread as he stared at the cooling bread.  I grinned, "Try to warm it."

Dorian looked up from his concentration, "What?  Sorry I..."

I smiled, I didn't really want to know what he'd been thinking about. "Try to warm it.  The pattern is already there, strengthen it.  I know you know what I mean, you teach kids to do it every day."

Dorian sighed, "You won't let it be, will you?"

I chuckled softly as I finished my mouh full, "Fat chance.  Just once.  Please?"  I was not above begging.

Dorian sighed giving in to my request.  "I suppose."

I watched Dorian with pleasure and curiousity.  I wished I could see from his perspective, relive that moment of dawning when you find that key to the pattern.  Sweat started to form on Dorian's brow but I saw the pattern strengthen and solidify and Dorian dropped the bread to his plate as it became too warm to touch.

Dorian frowned but he looked up with a half smile, "I suppose you are right."

I beamed at Dorian and patted Dorian's hand that was resting on the table.  "I knew you could do it."  I hadn't meant to do it.  It had been a reflex.

Dorian looked down at my hand on top of his and whispered, "I can't get over the fact that I met you when you were five."

He looked up at me with what I could only describe as fear in his eyes.  I scared him.  I knew that image was everything to Dorian.  And to him I'd always be five.  I nodded as I pulled my hand away from his. I understood the problem now.  And there was nothing I could do about it.

I cut the chicken in silence and stabbed a peice.  My fork clanked against the plate. Dorian asked, "So that's it?"  I looked up at him I couldn't answer a question I didn't know fully what it was.  He sighed, "You give up with a little bit of resistance?"

I shook my head and finished chewing.  "There is nothing **I** can do about your issue.  There will always be 14 years between us.  There will always be our shared history.  To you, I'll always be that little kid who you watched grow up."  I shook my head, "Sometimes I wonder if I hadn't been Cesari if you'd have even bothered looking after me."

Dorian sighed, "That's not fair.  I already told you I cared.  I care about everyone under my charge."

I nodded, "That's right.  You do.  So why me?  Why give a damn about me?."  I answered my own question. "Because I'm Cesari.  I'm your little niche.  I'm your gateway to fame."  I could feel my blood pressure rising, the anger that wanted to spew forth.

I could see that Dorian wanted to say something.  He stammered but he clamped his mouth shut and took a deep breath.  It was the only time I'd ever seen Dorian lose his cool.  He blinked at me and then took a sip of his wine.  "I will ignore that.  You open a door and when someone steps in you push them away.  I should have seen it earlier."

He knew me too well.  Dorian knew my every fatal flaw. He'd been watching me my entire life, going through my sessions with Margo, detailing my life in his records.  I dropped my head to my hands in despair.  He was right but I wasn't going to tell him that.  I pushed my plate forward, I'd lost my appetite again.  I felt like I was going to get sick.

I don't know how long we sat in silence before Dorian reached out across the table and I felt his fingers gently brush my elbow.  I looked up at him with fire in my eyes.  But Dorian didn't flinch at my anger.  He looked at me with pained eyes.  It made me feel bad for my out burst.  I saw the sadness creasing his forehead, the strain of keeping that perfect image up.  I saw raw need, but I didn't know what he needed.  I dropped my hands to the table, "What do you need, Dorian?"  It was the barest of whispers, I hadn't intended to say it out loud, but there it was.

He cocked his head to the side.  I would give anything to know what he was thinking.  "Right now, I need a friend.  Tomorrow who knows."  He pushed my plate back in front of me, "**You** need to eat."

I nodded with a sigh. And picked up my fork.  I finished eating what should have been a delightful meal.  We changed the topic and spoke about the patterns, and the difference in the way things worked.  We discussed what Jason was doing with the younger generation.  We talked about anything but us.

We sat for several minutes in each other's company after my plate was finished before Miguel came back and cleared things, "Will there be anything else?"

I looked to Dorian he'd said he wanted desert now was the time. "The fruit tart." 

The waitor looked to me and I nodded, "The same, and coffee please."

When Miguel left Dorian raised an eyebrow, "Am I that much of a lush?"

I laughed, "No, I just like coffee with my desert."

"Where as I'm having another glass of wine with mine."  After a moment of thought Dorian added, "What will we do afterwards?  I don't really want to go home yet."

I smiled, "What would you like to do, Dorian?  I'm sure I can find something that could satisfy your desires."  I frowned at the implications again, but Dorian gave me a reassuring smile.

"Surprise me." Dorian's bright blue eyes twinkling in the dim light of the restuaruant.

I grinned, "That could end very badly, my friend.  Be thankful my tastes are not quite as esoteric as Jason's.  Or you might find yourself in the middle of an orgie."

Dorian choked on his wine as he fought back laughter and slight embarrassment if the color of his face was any indication.  Dorian regained his composure and was able to speak, "Jason's got... interesting tastes." Dorian's comment made me wonder what he knew of Jason's tastes. "I assume you went along willingly?"

"Of course.  What's an outcast to do if he's offered fun and games with a friend where noone knows him."

Dorian asked in all seriousness. "Do you miss it?"

I shrugged, "I missed Jace, I don't miss running around making childish mistakes.  Even if those mistakes were pretty damn exciting."

"He's grown up, since you left.  He didn't have anyone to drag around, and then Mia snagged her fingers into him and he calmed down even more."

"Jason, had been willing years before to calm down for Mia.  Mia wasn't ready.  Their on again off again relationship wore them both down."

"Leaving you behind."  The concern was back in Dorian's voice.  Always looking out for me.  I tried not to think about it and let my thoughts go, but it wasn't easy.

"Nah.  I left.  It's all good."  I didn't blame Jace for moving on.  I would have too if I'd had someplace to go.

The tarts and my coffee arrived.  It looked decedant.  I enjoyed the sweet and tart with the bitterness of the coffee.  I couldn't have asked for a better meal.  Somehow over the course of our desert the conversation turned towards the breeding program.  

Dorian sighed, "The Dowager I've been asked by has decided it must be soon, this cycle she says.  I don't suppose I can put it off any longer."

To be forced into a sexual relationship was not something I would wish upon anyone.  A memory tugged at my mind and I pushed away the fear and the pain that started to rise.  I gave Dorian a look of sympathy, "If I could help you I would."

"Perhaps in time you could have."  Dorian added without thought.  Maybe it wasn't what he intended to say or not say it at all.  I wanted to hope for more, but right now Dorian needed a friend.  I could do that - for now.  Thankfully, Miguel choose that time to place a black folio with our bill in it on the table.  He didn't even bother to say anything as he scurried away leaving us alone again. 

I could have made a big deal about the possiblities, but I let it go.  I took the folio from the table but Dorian carefully pulled it from my hands before I had a chance to look at the bill.  He stood up and I couldn't help but look up at him slowly - taking him in.  It wasn't so much different than when I first saw him again except this time he was wearing a crisp button up shirt with long sleeves perfectly cuffed to his elbows.  The edge of his tattoo displayed down his right arm.  I hadn't reached his face before I saw money drop to the table on top of the bill.  He hadn't even looked at it.  There was way more cash there than my meal or the wine should have cost.  

I looked up at him and he was watching me.  "It's worth it."  I wanted to ask it was worth what, we hadn't done anything.  He'd barely eaten so it wasn't the food he was talking about.  I looked away taking the last swallow of my coffee before standing up.  I walked towards the door knowing Dorian was following me.  I could feel his eyes on me though I was confident that it was not the same feelings coursing through him that were running rampent through me.
# Surprises
_Monday, June 15, 2015 11:15PM_

We left the restaurant casually.  There were a few glares and dirtly looks from other patrons.  Obviously we were gay!  I hated bigots.  I held the door for Dorian and he gave me a brief smile before stepping into the night air.  I looked up and saw no stars.  Such was the way of the city.  I would miss the stars.

I wasn't exactly sure what we could do.  Dorian wasn't exactly the type of guy you take dancing.  Though I would love to move my body against his on the dance floor.  I had to push the thoughts away, I wasn't sure how much temptation I could handle.  I was being a friend - you don't sleep with your friends, at least that was my general rule.

This was supposed to be about patterns, so I lead the way to the compound.  We walked on the streets for now.  The train wouldn't be here for another few minutes and there were enough stops we could catch one later down the line.  I was enjoying the cool air and brushing my hand against Dorian's as we walked. It was easiest to show him things when we were around them.  So we went home to people watch.  With Jace we'd make fun of most of the people, but with Dorian I expected that it wasn't going to be the same.

The next subway station I went down and Dorian asked, "Home?"

I nodded, "You wanted to talk patterns, it's easier to show you where there is a diversity of patterns naturally walking around."

Dorian gave me a look I couldn't quite read, "Not what I expected..."

"You expected something more private?"  I tried to hide my amusement and the fact that I really did want to do such things.  

Dorian nodded, "Going home, implied a different activity in my head.  I wasn't exactly sure how to navigate that particular situation."

I gave Dorian a sympathetic smile.  I wanted to say _Me too_ but I didn't, "Not tonight."  I winked, "Shocking I know."

We rode the train home in a comfortable silence.  We choose to stand even though there were plenty of seats.  This time there was no touching, though I desparately wanted to.  I kept my eyes on the floor and tried to take in only Dorian's scent.  This particular car was overriding everything with old urine and body odor of the most unpleasant kind.

We reached our stop and I followed Dorian out the doors and walked a few steps behind him admiring his back side before I caught up to him, my thoughts were all over the place again.  I was feeling 15.  Dorian held the door for me as he had been the entire night, his hand sliding along the small of my back.  It was the gentlemanly thing to do and it made me laugh inside to think this was not how it usually went down for me.  But his touch made me shiver and I had to fight every fiber of my being stamping down the attraction that continued to grow for Dorian.

I headed for the elevator and Dorian followed.  I watched as the plate glass elevator made its descent and I couldn't help the shudder than ran through my body.  The door whooshed open to go back up and we waited while people filed out and we stepped inside.  We were the only one's standing in the glass box.

"To the roof I assume?"  I nodded and Dorian pushed the button to the top floor; we'd still have to take the stairs once we reached the top.  We rose up and up in the plate glass death trap.  I closed my eyes and focused on the soft scent that made me feel safe.  Dorian put his arm on the railing behind me and leaned in close, "This is what I didn't like." 

I spoke softly, "Can't be helped."  I opened my eyes and turned towards Dorian.  He was impossibly close.  I whispered, "I am fine though, I promise.  Not going to crumble or collapse in a crying heap or anything."

Dorian chuckled, "Good to know."  

Dorian didn't move away and I couldn't help taking in a deep breath.  This close I could smell the sweet wine on top of his usual calming scent.  I whispered, "You smell delectiable."

Dorian looked at me with a shy smile. As we rose higher and higher Dorian whispered back, "I hadn't expected this."  He sounded as out of breath as I felt.  I wanted to ask what he had expected, but Dorian continued, "You are trouble Nox."

I grinned, "I know."  We watched the numbers slowly reach their apex and before the doors opened Dorian had already stepped away from me.  This wasn't my first crush and yet I was acting like it everytime he touched me.  

We headed towards the stairs.  The door to the roof was already propped open and I could hear all kinds of people up there already.  I could see the panic in Dorian's eyes as he walked with me up the last few stairs and on to the roof.

I lead Dorian to a back corner of the throng where I knew a bunch of milk crates stood for seats.  Dorian kicked the dust off of one of the crates before sitting down, I hadn't bothered.  I sat close to him but I made sure not to touch him.  Image was everything for Dorian.  And I wasn't part of that image.

I could see some familiar faces, but the majoity of them I didn't know.  I could see alot of air benders, and a few who could do both air and earth, but what was shocking was the amount of people who couldn't bend anything at all.  I commented to Dorian, "Seems ato be a lot of non-mangnus up here tonight."

Dorian looked around, "How can you tell?"

I smiled, and so it began.  "A distinct lack of patterns around them.  No pull.  No push. They just are."

Dorian leaned closer so I could hear him over the crowd, that seemed to be getting louder and louder,  "Describe the patterns around someone, anyone, just not me."  Dorian smiled, "I don't want you staring at me that intently."

I laughed and I didn't want to tempt myself with my smart ass comment about wanting to watch him all night long.  I nodded towards the man in front of us with his back to us, "The guy in front of us, the one in the jeans and the Knick's basketball jersey.  He's a water bender.  Water is always hard so probably not a good one to use but he's the easiest to see right now.  The patterns shift like water around him.  Imagine that each element is a color and if I were to paint a static image of him in one percise moment..." I used the empty space in front of us and used my finger to draw with fire leaving a lasting vision. "The lines are exaggerated but the pattern is the same."  The lines faded quickly as the fire disappated. 

Dorian nodded.  "Okay, they flow around him like water, I think I can see something. It's faint though."

I nodded, "It'll get stronger with practice, but the strength in which you see it as well, usually says how strong they are.  I'd peg him around a 3, able to duplicate given a strong source."

A figure stepped out of the shadows and stood in front of us.  The only things I saw in my field of vision was a pair of faded blue jeans and an old pair of canvas converse.  I looked up with a grin and saw Jace standing there.  He was grinning down at us, "You two having fun?"  

Jason turned to the crowd, "He's finally here."

I stood up and looked around, "You waiting on me for something?"

The crowd cheered.  Jason smiled, "Of course.  Rumors flooded the compound when you jumped this morning."

I nodded, "That's why there is so many up here tonight?"

"That and Skylar and Van are throwing their last hurrah!"  Dorian was standing next to me but slightly behind me like I was his shield.  I hoped he didn't dart off the moment he felt uncomfortable, I would leave with him.  I grabbed his hand from behind me and held on to it descretely.  I wanted to stay with him.

Two others joined us, I vaguely remembered them.  I could feel Dorian tug away, I pulled him back and turned towards him, "Wait, please?  Let me see what they want then we can go."

Before Dorian could answer the girl who was about Jason's height brushed the red lock of hair away from her face.  She smiled at me, she had to be Skylar.  "Jump with us.  We'd love to have our last jump with you.  Van and I are going to Brasilia in a few days, we won't have this type of jump again for a long time."

I shook my head, "I don't know.  Let me talk with my friend first and I'll let you know."

Jace pulled the two away, "They are on a date, let's leave them some more alone time."  

I sighed, it wasn't a date, but I really wanted to spend the remainder of the night with Dorian.  I would love to jump with him, share that with him.  It was almost heaven.  I could share it with him even if there was nothing else to share...

Dorian grinned at me, "I never knew you were a cult leader."  His comment brought me out of my thoughts.

I smiled, "Neither did I."  I stepped closer and frowned, "I'm sorry about this.  We can go."

Dorian shook his head, "No stay, jump, be with your friends."

I smiled and shook my head.  "They aren't my friends."  I held out my hand to Dorian, "Jump with me."  I leaned closer so only he could hear me whisper, "I'd very much like to share this with you."

Dorian shook his head, "I don't think that's a good idea."

"Don't trust me?" I asked with a grin.

"I do trust you.  Just..."

I asked again, "Jump with me?  It's 8 seconds of your life and I won't ask it of you again."

"8 seconds until I splat on the ground."  Dorian was afraid of jumping.  I beleive he trusted me, but the thought terrified him.  It used to terrify me.

"I won't let that happen.  I promise.  I won't let you go."  I put my hand on Dorian's waist and pulled him to me.  I pressed his body against mine.  I whispered "I won't let you go.  You don't have to do anything but hold on.  I'll take you for the ride of your life."

Dorian chuckled in my ear, "That could be taken so many ways."

My heart was pounding, my blood was rushing to places that made my jeans tighter than usual.  I was breathless in Dorian's ear.  "Yeah."  I begged, "Jump with me?  please?"  I wanted this as much as I wanted Dorian in that moment.  I wanted to feel the rush of the wind on my skin as I watched Dorian.  I wanted to feel the thrill on the landing with Dorian in my arms.  

Dorian took a setp back and looked at me.  I couldn't imagine what he was looking for, what peice of information I held that would lead to his answer.  He frowned and shook his head.  "I don't think that's a good idea."  He pulled away from me completely, "You stay.  Jump.  Have fun.  I'm gonna go."

I shook my head, "No, I told you **we** could go."  I smiled at Dorian.  I hoped it was more reassuring then I felt.  I didn't need to jump or fullfil someone elses dream, right now I was doing one thing and one thing alone - being Dorian's friend.  He didn't want to be alone after his mother died.  I would be that friend for him, because I didn't think I could be much else with him.  I would take what I could get.  "Stay here.  Let me give them my best and I'll be right back."

Dorian nodded, but I didn't think he was going to stick around.  I stood there staring at him for a few moments before I turned and wound my way through the crowd.  I found Jace with Skylar and Van, they were chatting with excitement.   They were going to be disappointed but I didn't really care.  I walked over to them shaking my head.  "Sorry guys.  I have other plans tonight.  I can't jump."

Jason smacked my back with that "atta-boy" smile.  He thought this really was a date.  And again I wondered what Dorian had really understood about Jason's activities.  Skylar pouted, "It's alright.  Maybe next time."

I nodded and turned around to find Dorian.  I found my way back to where I'd left him and he wasn't there.  _Fuck!_  I knew he wouldn't stay.

I took a deep breath and accepted the fact that the night was over.  I could jump but my heart wasn't in it now.  I started down the stairs, at the bottom of the landing Dorian sat and looked up as he heard my footsteps.  "I needed some quiet."  

I gave him a small smile.  I was neither happy nor sad to find him waiting on me.  That small moment had changed everything.  "What do you want to do now?"  I asked flatly.

"Something a little more calm and peaceful with less people."

"What did you have in mind?"

"A movie, popcorn, something tame."  I nodded.  I would keep Dorian company as long as he needed me to.  We rounded the first bend of the stairs and Dorian asked, "Why did you want me to jump with you?"

I shook my head, "Doesn't matter."

Dorian stopped and when I stopped at the bottom platform I was looking up at him, he was frowning down on me, "It does matter.  Do you want me to jump that badly?"

"No, Dorian, I don't.  I won't make you do anything you don't want to do."  I started walking away and I could hear Dorian walking behind me, his super human speed was an advantage he had used to catch up.

He asked softly, "You are mad?"

I stopped and turned around.  Dorian bumped into me.  I could see his bright blue eyes shining at me in the dim light.  "I'm not mad, Dorian.  I thought you left.  I don't deal with rejection well."  He was close enough to kiss and I had to keep my eyes firmly locked on his to keep myself from going there.  

I swallowed the lump forming in my throat as Dorian asked, "Why did you want me to jump with you?"

I dropped my gaze.  My mouth suddenly went dry and I felt like if I said it, he'd just be gone forever, but he asked again and Dorian hated to repeat himself.  It was a lesson you learn quickly.  I whispered, "I wanted to share something intimate with you."

I turned and started back down the stairs.  This time I didn't hear Dorian's footsteps follow right away.  But they did eventually start.  I stopped at the landing to Dorian's floor.  Mine was still a few flights down.  I waited for him just inside the stairwell.  I saw his leather shoes first, and watched as he took slow steps down towards me.  I never raised my gaze from his shoes.  I was afraid to meet his eyes.  I asked softly, "Still want company?"

Dorian hooked a finger under my chin and my eyes instantly rose to meet his.  It was a gesture he'd used often in the early days.  He gave me a comforting smile, "If you want to."

I nodded in the direction of his door, and he opened it and lead me through with a hand at the small of my back like he had been all night.  I swallowed back the pain and just walked.
# Dreams
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 12:30AM_

It was a strained silence as we finished the walk to his apartment door.  I was highly impressed with his status.  The money he'd dropped was impressive but the moment he opened the plain door to his apartment, I was in awe.

The floor was large gray slate tiles, the walls were white except for the accent wall of wood that was a bookshelf and tv stand all in one.  The bookshelf had a few decorative books, glass sculptures and other elegant looking figurines.  I felt like I had walked into a show peice, I didn't want to touch anything.  The furniture was all modern sleek lines in whites and greys, in the middle of the room a white long shag rug was the situated under a low black coffee table, the two couches and an ottoman surrounded the table. 

I gave a long whistle of appreciation.  "Sweet digs." It was more enthusastic than intended with my prior mood.  The kitchen was open, it sported the only color, a deep blood red accent on the bar stools and light fixtures hanging from the ceiling above the bar.  The same color vases and other small items were placed strategcially around the kitchen which was otherwise white and grey with stainless steel appliances.

Dorian was in the kitchen opening a cupboard and pulling out a few things, he was true to his word, popcorn, and of course he was opening a bottle of wine while the popcorn steadily popped in the microwave.  

When the popcorn was decidedly done popping Dorian opened the microwave door and poured the bag into a glass bowl and sat it on the bar.  He looked up at me with his bright blue eyes. "Show you the rest?"  I nodded I didn't trust my voice, I knew I couldn't hide my admiration or my other slightly more obvious reactions.  I had to fight the urge to worry about Dorian wasting his money and status on me.  I was nothing compared to him...

Dorian lead me down a short hallway and opened the door the bathroom. It was elegant too, white with gold accents on everything including the faucets, it was only a half bath.  The only other door in the hallway lead to his bedroom.  

Dorian opened the door and I took in the difference of sceneary.  Instead of the blacks, greys and whites with little color as everything else the walls of Dorian's room were painted a deep blue, the floor was the same throughout the house, all grey tiles made of slate, the bed was dressed in white except for the accent pillows, I was fairly certain that the sheets underneath the white comforter would match the walls.

I smiled, "Not what I expected."

Dorian gave me a weak smile, "Few see my room.  Few get to see the difference."

I turned Dorian and grinned playfully at him, "The playful and colorful side?"  I was slowly returning to my default state.  I disliked showing someone what I was like alone.

"Something like that."  

I turned and headed back towards the living area.  I could feel Dorian's eyes on me as he asked, "What would you like to watch?"

I shook my head and grabbed the bowl of popcorn and a glass of wine.  Dorian picked up his own and the bottle and we sat down on the couch in front of the flat screen tv.  It was far larger than any I had owned myself.  "I haven't seen anything recently.  What do you have?"

Dorian grabbed the remote from the table and flipped the TV on and mashed a few buttons and the Xbox One logo floated through the screen and in a few more taps of the keys on the remote we were scrolling through an impressive list of movies.  I wondered how much of that was from a torrent and I chuckled to myself.  

I saw Dorian look at me with a questioning look, "Was just wondering if you'd illegally downloaded any of the movies."

Dorian laughed, "Oh you know me."

I smiled, "That's why I was laughing.  Such a proposterous thought.  Jace might but you... never."

Dorian scrolled through the movies.  "Wait, go back, I've not see that."

Dorian smiled, "Good choice.  Fun and heroic."

I laughed.  "And it has a cute raccoon in it."  Dorian laughed and pushed play.  The lights automatically dimmed until we were left with only the glow from the movie starting, "Ain't that a sweet trick.  I bet you use that on all the guys."

I had let my mouth run again too long and the uncomfortable silence was quickly filled by Dorian. "You're the first.  I'll have to keep it in mind."  I chuckled and Dorian's voice became even more serious, "I don't typically bring them home.  And I don't think the ones I might have would be so easily impressed by the dimming feature."

I laughed, "I've got simple tastes, what can I say."  We started Guardians of the Galaxy.  The movie jumped straight into the emotional crap.  A kid with a dying mother was probably not the best opener.  I watched Dorian from the corner of my eye as Peter ran after his mother slipped away.  Even I felt that pain slide over me, I couldn't imagine what it was like for Dorian.  The event so raw.  

I picked up the bowl of popcorn that sat between us and set it in my lap as I moved closer to Dorian.  I didn't do it to make a move, but I put my arm across the back of the couch and draped it over Dorian's opposite shoulder and pulled him closer to me.  

He adjusted slightly and leaned against my shoulder.  We watched Starlord dance through trouble and then the fun started Rocket and Grout showed up.  

Things were going well until the prison escape.  I was starting to drift with the comforting scent of Dorian everywhere.  Peter went back for the Walkman he treasured as a child and I felt Dorian shatter.  It was only noticeable because I was holding him against me when his body started to shake with silent tears.  I knew the feeling well, I'd done it too many times to count.  

I pulled Dorian closer and wrapped my arms around him.  He shift with my guidance until we were almost laying down together.  He silently cried in front of me while I buried my face in the back of his neck.  I listened to the movie and hummed quietly in Dorian's ear.  

He relaxed and quieted as the action ramped back up.  I was pinned between him and the back of the couch.  I was warm.  I felt safe holding Dorian against me.  I drifted in and out of consciousness as the movie finished.  

I felt Dorian move away from me but not what he said as he did.  He leaned over and kissed my cheek with a muttered thanks.  I felt the blanket fall over my shoulder before I drifted completely off into a deep dreamless sleep.

The first ray of light in my eyes caught me off guard as I started awake.  I sat up and blinked away the sun as I tried to gather my bearings.  Where the hell was I?

The greys and blacks and whites reminded me I was with Doian.  I found myself under a blanket with a blue pillow underneath my head.  I picked it up and inhaled deeply, it smelled of Dorian.  I could feel my body stir with the scent.  I relaxed into the pillow.  I was lost in his scent.

I made myself put the pillow down, I had to take care of things.  I headed towards the gold and white bathroom.  I noticed Dorian's door was cracked open.  I peeked inside and saw Dorian's sleeping form lying in the bed.  The sheets had been blue as I'd thought.  He looked exquisit lying against the sheets in nothing but a pair of green boxers.  He'd kicked off the blankets and I had full view of his tattoo.  It covered half of his body from neck to ankle.  I wondered how long it had taken and where the tattoo went inside his boxers.  I couldn't help the thought that passed through my mind.  I pushed it away wondering if Dorian was always a violent sleeper or if he'd had nightmares last night.  I hope it wasn't nightmares.

I went back to the bathroom and releived myself.  After I cleaned up a little, wetting my face, washing as best I could I went into Dorian's kitchen and started rummaging around looking for coffee and what other suitable breakfast I could provide the sleeping Scrin in the other room.

Surprisingly I was well rested and coffee didn't seem quite so necessary, but I craved that morning ritual at the minimum. 

I found some  but they were high end beans.  I started them anyway in a coffee maker that looked like it had been used maybe twice.  In the fridge I found eggs and bacon.  I hoped I was't runing any of Dorian's plans, but I was starving and intended to cook for Dorian.

I found my hoodie drapped over the couch, Dorian had helped me get comfortable, I wondered how much I had helped. Because I didn't remember much.  I took my ear buds from my pocket and plugged it into my phone.  It was much later than I thought it was.  8:45.  I'd never slept that late in my life, even if I had a late night.

I started frying bacon in a pan and had eggs ready to go.  I was dancing around cleaning and cooking as I went along and I noticed Dorian sit down at the bar with a smile on his face as he ran his fingers through his dishevealed hair. I smiled at him but I had to pull my gaze away from Dorian's naked upper torso to watch my bacon.  I knew I was smiling like a mad man.   Dorian continued to watch me as I poured two mugs of coffee and set one down in front of him and started working on the eggs.  He never said anything as he sipped at his coffee and watched me cook in **his** kitchen.

I made two plates and set one down in front of Dorian.  I wanted to run my fingers along the top of Dorian's boxers as I walked back behind him but I kept my hands to myself as I sat down next to him to eat my own food.

Dorian took a bite of the eggs and he let out a gracious sigh, "Oh my god.  That was in my kitchen?"

I laughed, "Yes, yes it was."

Dorian took a bit of the bacon he held between two fingers of his left hand.  I never thought I'd see the day that Dorian Vega was eating with his fingers.  I was a bad influence on the man.  He looked at me and grinned, "No one has ever made me breakfast before."

I grinned playfully at Dorian, "That's because you never bring them home."

Dorian nodded, "You are right.  I'm glad you made yourself at home."

I wasn't sure if I detected sarcasm or truth but it didn't matter Dorian was happily enjoying his breakfast, "I was hungry.  And I didn't want to leave without saying anything."

Dorian smiled, "Well thank you for staying.  And thank you for breakfast."  Dorian finished the bacon in his hand and looked back at me, "And thanks for last night."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Anytime."  Dorian started to get up and take his plate with him.  But I was already standing and I ran my fingers gently across his back.  It was probably too bold but I wanted to flirt with him so bad. "I got it.  I made the mess I can clean up."  I reached across his body and grabbed his plate from behind.  I was careful not to press against him.  He watched me, I could feel the caution in the air.  

It was too much, but I heard Dorian laugh, "I think I like this."

I set to cleaning up ignoring the fact that I knew Dorian was watching every move I made.  I felt safe under his watchful gaze.  I didn't want to think too hard about it, or too long.  I knew I'd ruin it somehow.

Everything was cleaned and put in their correct places.  Dorian only corrected me once on the placement of something.    I walked around the bar and stood in next to Dorian in his green boxers as he sat on the blood red bar stool. "I should go grab a shower and change clothes.  I should probably get back to work." 

Dorian looked up at me and nodded, "Yeah.  I have work to do myself." He stared at one another for a while before Dorian broke the silence. "Thank you for spending the night with me.  I appreciate it."  I watched his lips as he spoke and I wanted to kiss them.  I wanted to do so much more but I reminded myself I don't sleep with my friends.

I nodded slowly before I could manage to speak without sounding like I was breathless, "You are welcome.  Anytime.  And I won't tell anyone I was here"  I found it very difficult to walk away from Dorian.  I eventually made myself, "I'll see you later."

Dorian got up and followed me to the door.  I turned around with my hand on the door knob and I smiled at Dorian.  "We need to do this again."

I didn't wait for answer before I opened the door and stepped outside.  There was a woman walking past.  Dorian stood in the doorway as I started down the hall.  I turned around and saw him standing there in only his green boxers.  I can't imagine that was in his normal image but he watched me leave. I gave him a flourished bow and blew him a kiss and heard the woman scoff as she hurried on her way.  I laughed.  Dorian was shaking his head.  I grinned, "I'm sorry I couldn't help it."

Dorian was still shaking his head, "Uh huh."  I gave him a wave of my hand and turned around and headed back towards my rooms.  I needed a shower.# Connections
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 9:30AM_

I was half way to my rooms when I caught the distinct sight of a small gym.  I stopped outside the propped open door and peired inside.  I could use a short work out, vent some of my fustration.    My neck was a little sore from sleeping on the couch.  I was surprised my back wasn't sore too.  I smiled at the memories of what little dreams I remembered having.  I remembered the scents most, but that had been Dorian's pillow.  I rubbed the back of my neck out of reflex.

A voice from behind me made me jump, "Rough night?"

I turned around and saw my father smirking at me.  He was carrying a bunch of files, a towel and a bottle of water.  He was dressed to work out.  He looked like he was going to work and work out at the same time.  I had done it many times, apparently it ran in the family.

I grinned at him, "Sleeping on the couch does that."  I stepped away from the door but Kai stood where he was.  He looked at me like he knew where I was and he thought I was lying.

"While you are here."  Kai handed me the files he'd been carrying and he went inside putting the rest of his things on the bench as he started warming up with stretches.  "Talk to me.  Why are these files important to you?"

I took a look at the files and noticed that these were the same files I had been working.  I looked down at my father stretching and he just shrugged.  He didn't bother explaining why he'd taken my work.  

"These are Dorian's files on Cesari and me and others like me.  They are how he came to his theory.  These files are from Mrs. Vega about the two cases of yours and Emilio that could possibly fit Dorian's theory.  But since none of them can bend all the elements only thing I can figure is it's Exuli helping out.  It would fit with Dorian's theory."

"I haven't had time to go through the files yet as the fire alarms went off, and then we went on a scavenger hunt for the baseball hats."

Kai had moved from stretches to shadow boxing.  I watched him as he moved flawlessly from form to form.  He moved with precision and speed I was envious of.  I could have the precision, but the speed not so much.  "What are these two cases you think are connected?"

"They are two exiles you were party to.  One was a woman whom you carried out kicking and screaming.  The other you escorted calmly to Texas."

Kai nodded.  "Okay.  But none of them are Magnus."

I nodded my head in confirmation, "Correct."

"Where are they located?"

I looked through their files.  "Mrs. Cox hasn't checked in for about 30 years.  She was last in Chicago with a daughter and her son was exiled with her.  The others checked in two months ago still in Africa where they fled to." I smirked, "Preaching the word of God!"

Kai laughed, "How ironic.  Looks like Chicago is our link."

I nodded.  "Seems to be a good start."

Kai took the papers from my hands and set them down on the bench, "You came here for a reason?"

I smirked, "I was doing that when you rudely took the files away."

Kai laughed and shook his head, "I meant the here and now.  Outside the gym."  He still looked like he thought I was lying about sleeping on the couch.

"I guess.  I was debating it."  I sighed, "Haven't had a good workout in a few weeks.  Sleeping on couches and on the ground isn't good on the back.  And trees don't make good workout equipment."  I grinned, "Too many splinters."

Kai smiled at me, "Show me what you got boy."

I laughed, "Yeah I learned along time ago not to go up against a full Venatori.  I prefer to keep the bruises I get to a minimum.  Not too good for picking up the ladies"

"Or the men, I imagine."  Kai said dryly.

"Ha!  Kai making a joke at my expense, how new." I spouted before I could catch myself.  I was mildly surprised to see that Kai was just grinning at my comment.  I sighed, "Fine."

I took off my shoes and socks, it was easier to work on the mats barefoot, and there was something freeing about not having socks on.  I pulled my shirt over my head and heard Kai whistle. "Damn Boy!"

I frowned.  I was a little concerned about my father when he nodded towards my chest. I looked down and saw the black and blue bruise from where Aaron had landed his lucky punch.  "Like I said, I like to keep my bruises to a minimum."

"You get into fights often?"

I laughed, "Not as often as I used to.  I was beat on pretty regularly by my roommates."

"You let them hit you?"  He sounded concerned, like I was letting myself get beat.  And in a way I was.  At times I had let them hurt me, but I didn't have control.  They'd triggered the reflex Garrett had instilled in me.  But that didn't happen often.

I shrugged, "It's better that way.  When the big black man punches me first my defense of myself does't come off as me being the bully.  Because I will always win."  I grinned at Kai.

He flashed a proud smile.  "I'm sure you do."

Kai was done talking as he threw a punch and I barely moved in time.  I still wasn't fast enough as my father's fist landed in my chin.  I could feel the bruise starting to form.  I rubbed the spot.  "You really do suck at this."

"I told you I learned along time ago I wasn't going to win with my skill and speed alone.  I needed a little help."

Kai laughed, "You cheat, in other words."

I shook my head, "Not realy.  I use my gift."

Kai nodded he looked lost in thought.  I wondered if he was remember what I had done to him in the hall way."  "If you singe a hair on my head I will kill you out right."

I grinned and laughed, "I'd like to see you try, Kai."

"Stop calling me Kai."

I sighed, "Would you prefer sir, or Mr. Viddens then.  Because I'm sure as hell not calling you Dad or Father or any other such endearmeant.  I could call you a few choice words if you prefer."

Kai sighed, "Is that the only other option.  You either insult me or take such formality I search for my father?"

I laughed, "And yet another thing we have in common.  But yes, that is the only other options."

Kai nodded, "Fine.  Kai will work - for now, boy."

I laughed, "Do I dare ask you not to call me boy?  I've not been a boy for several years now."

Kai nodded, "Fair is fair.  Now if you don't mind, Nox.  Let's spar."

The use of my name caught me off guard as Kai threw a series of punches.  I managed to block the blows with a shield of air and Kai exclaimed, "That will take getting used to."  I grinned, "Wipe that grin off your face."

We started circling one another.  Kai threw another punch and I dodged his hands would have made contact if I hadn't put the shield of air up to deflect his course.  

Series after series of punches came at me, he was trying to whip the grin off my face.  I couldn't help but grin wider.  It was more fun to taunt my tormentors than not to.

Kai was so focused on his mission that he wasn't expecting it when I dropped to the ground and swiped my leg underneath him and he fell to his back.  I stood above him and tried not to smirk as I offered him a hand up.

He took it out of spite I'm sure.  He probably didn't like the idea of me helping him, but it was sportsman like and we were trying to be civil to one another.

We started again this time Kai started a series of blows faster than I could see.  Many were blocked but a few landed as I wasn't quick enough to move the shield from place to place as Kai changed directions.  I was having a hard time breathing and I needed to end the onslaught, I pushed my hands in front of me a wave of air moved towards Kai and he flew backwards landing on his back again.

I gasped for breath as I walked over to him and offered him a hand up again.  He took it and sat up, "Air benders see you a mile away don't they?"

I nodded.  I couldn't breathe still.  Kai stood up and tossed me my shirt.  "One day I'd like to watch you work all the elements like that."

I nodded finally able to talk again, "I'm sure you'll have ample oppurtunity once we catch this guy."

Kai smiled and headed for the door with his bottle of water and his towel around his shoulders.  "Let me know what you find in the files.  I'll leave it to you since you have a handle on the theory.  I will be questioning our inside man suspects again today.

I sighed.  My father was gone just as fast as he had come into my morning.  I was left with the need to shower even more than before, but I'd found a bit more respect for my father.  I would try to do better around him. # More Interruptions
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 10:30AM_

The work out had been good for my soul, it always was.  I would likely have a few more bruises to show off later.  At least they'd be gone soon enough.  I reached in my pocket for my key and another voice interrupted my thoughts, it seemed the day for that.  "You seem awful happy with yourself."

I smiled at the short raven haired woman behind me.  "Been a good morning for a change."  

Dae'lin ran her finger down the length of my jaw, "As opposed to?"

I grinned, "That was mutually beneficial fight."  I turned and unlcoked my door with the key from my pocket.  I was surprised it didn't find itself in the crevices of Dorian's cushions.  The images brought very naughty things to mind and I had to push the thoughts away.

I opened my door and walked inside, Dae'lin followed and closed the door behind her.  "I had a good morning not much you can say that will change that."

She sighed, "I bet I can.  You and I never had a chance to talk yesterday.  You have time now?"

I sighed.  "I need a shower, but yeah I guess we can talk."

I sat down on the bed and Dae'lin pulled a chair in front of me. She crossed her legs to draw attention to them.  And it did, I followed what appeared to be long silky legs up her body and noticed that Dae'lin was dressed to kill.  The light blue dress she wore fit her curves in ways I couldn't have possibly imagined based on her normal dress.  She was trying to impress me.  

I laughed, "You try too hard."

She leaned forward not realizing what she ws doing, her cleevage revealed far more than she anticipated.  "I do what?"  She seethed at me.

I grinned and removed myself from the temptation that she was throwing in my face.  "You try too hard."  I walked over to the fridge and grabbed two bottles of water then a glass I filled with ice from the freezer.  "I'd notice you even if you didn't dress like that."

I poured one of the bottles into the glass and brought it to Dae'lin.  I drapped my arm over her shoulder and handed her the glass from behind as I leaned over to whisper in her ear. "You don't need to impress me Dae'lin."  I could see the color rising in her ear and smiled, "I'm not oblivous to your charms despite my feelings about this whole thing."  I brushed my lips against her neck and moved around to sit back on my bed away from her.  

She sighed, "You...."  She looked flustered, her normally tanned skin was rosy red from the rush of hormones I'd insighted in her.  It was good to know she wasn't oblivious to me if we were going to have any chance of making a child together.

I smiled softly, "I'm what?  Attracted to you?  Have certain tastes?  You think you need to grab my attention to win?  Would there even be anyone else in the running Dae'lin?  You are the only match the council will allow me to join in this particular union with."

I sighed, "They want Cesari and you are the only possible solution to that dilemia right now."

Dae'lin sighed, "It doesn't have to be like that.  There can be more."

I laughed, "You don't want more.  You want to do your duty and that's it.  You can override my limitations.  It's Genetics over love. I'm right aren't I?"

Dae'lin looked down.  I had nailed it.  She was embarrassed.  When she looked up I could see that she was far more rosy colored than before.  "Is that why you chose to be with men?  To sleep with who you want?  To fuel you limitations?"

I laughed, "Dae'lin I sleep with men because I enjoy it.  I am honest to god attracted to men.  I like women.  I find their bodies appealing in a way a man's is not.  I am not shy about my proclivaties because I want people to not like me.  I'm aware of my own limitations and my problems.  I like men Dae'lin  there is nothing you or anyone is going to be able to say or do that will change that."

Dae'lin laughed, "I knew you flaunted your sexuality on prupose.  But why just not be gay."

I laughed, "I like women, Duckling. It's not an either or for me.  I do like both."

Dae'lin sighed, "But..."

"But what Dae'lin?"

The woman blushed yet again she was going to remain beat red if she didn't stop it, "I saw you leave Dorian's room this morning."

"Did you now?  Who did you tell?"

She looked at me with confusion.  "No one.  Why?"

I shook my head, "No reason.  Dorian didn't want to be alone.  We went to dinner, talked patterns, watched a movie where I proceeded to fall asleep on his couch.  I made him breakfast and then I left."

"Rumors run around here like wildfire.  They said you looked cozy with him."

I smiled, "And what business is it of your's who I get cozy with?  You want my genetics, I am not going to get Dorian pregnant unless there is something I truly do not know about sex."

Dae'lin paled.  "You don't even deny it?"

"Deny what?  That I like Dorian.  That I want to sleep with him? What point would there be in that, Dae'lin?  I like men.  I _like_ Dorian.  It'll get around even if I deny it."

"But..."  

I stood up and walked around behind her again and whispered in her ear, "Do you want the deep down and dirty details, Dae'lin?  Do you want to know how we had sex all night long?" Dae'lin paled as I continued.  "Dorian has no fucking bearing on anything you and I do.  If he and I choose to do anything it's none of your damned business."

I backed away  "What are the terms?"  It sat back down on the bed and waited for Dae'lin go speak.

She sighed and steadied herself against the chair.  "My line, then your's provided they pass as Venatori, with your limitations being the only acceptable outcome."

"And if the children fail to have enhance senses and healing at minimum?"

Dae'lin sighed, "Death."

I shook my head, "No fucking way."

"They do not want to weaken the lines any farther, Nox."  She pleaded with me.  "I don't think they will negotiate that."

"Fine on the weakening the lines, I understand that, but there is no fucking way I'm going to agree to have my child killed because he doesn't meet some stupid rule.  Steralize him, remove him from the breeding programs, but death, if that is the only way, then they can go to fucking hell Dae'lin.  I will not do it.  I can't beleive you would let them do that to your child."

"It is my duty."

"Fuck duty."  I started pacing.  There was no way I was killing any of my offspring.  I watched the patterns shift in my room.

Dae'lin quickly moved her chair and rushed to my side.  She put her hand on my arm, "Calm down."

I looked at Dae'lin, "Calm down?  I'm not you."  I ws so pissed right now at her that she thought I couldn't control myself like she did.  "I'm not going to start a damn fire because I'm pissed off.  That shit was beat out of me as a child.  You may think it was all flowers and candy in my training.  But it wasn't."

Dae'li looked at me like I was lying.  "No one beat you as a child, Nox."

I yanked my arm free of her grip, "The fuck they didn't."

"Someone would have told me if other kids were getting abused."

I smirked, "Who said they told anyone?  I sure as hell didn't.  But I made sure he wouldn't do it again when I got control of my abilities.  Got another fucking year of fire starter training for that 'accident'".  I put air quotes around the world accident.

Dae'lin sound incredulous, "Nox!"

"What?  He fucking beat me every day for more than a year. I was half human female born minorem, no one would care about me if I died.  He beat me because I sparked when I was afraid.  The first time he was understanding, the remainder of them he beat me to make me stop sparking.  You know the only good thing about my abilities, the healing allowed him to beat me and hide the fact that he had been."

"So you what, lit him on fire.  I remember your last accident.  Your instructor..."  Dae'lin didn't finish the sentence as she covered her mouth in realization.  She reached out and touched my hand, "I didn't know."

I pulled away from Dae'lin and flopped down on the bed, "No one knew, Dae'lin and I'd appreciate it stay that way."

Dae'lin sat on the edge of the bed, I stared up at the ceiling, "If we have a fire-starter they won't go through that Dae'lin. I'll train the kid myself."

Dae'lin put her hand on my knee, "I understand.  I will speak to them about unqualified children.  They will relent."

I nodded, "What else do we have to go over?"

"We can talk about this later, Nox."

I sat up.  "No.  We'll finish it now I don't want to rehash this conversation later."

Dae'lin sighed, "I don't want to be a mother."

"You what?"  Nox raised an eyebrow.  "You expect me to do this?"
 
Dae'lin got up and started pacing, "The Venatori can raise my children, I don't want my mother's life."

I sighed, "No, Dae'lin they won't.  Your bloodline should be raised by you.  But if you refuse then I will."

Dae'lin sighed turned on her heel and stared at me like I was an alien, "You'd give up hunting to raise a child?  You would stay here?"

"I would stay here even if you wanted to raise the child yourself.  I will not be my father, and I will not be my mother."  I nearly spat at the thought of leaving a child to the will of the Venatori.

Dae'lin started walking for the door.  "Nox.  How is it that we see things so differently.  I thought...."  She opened the door and I shifted the patters to keep it closed.  She stared at me with heat rising in her eyes.  "Let me go, Nox."

I walked over to her and put my hand against the door above her head and whsiered in her ear.  I could smell the rose petals of her perfume. "You thought you'd raised me differently.  You thought because I had no parents, that I'd be okay with letting my children live the life I had."

Dae'lin looked up at me with pleading eyes and I shook my head.  My voice was quiet and distanct, I could feel the pain and the fear just below the surface.  I couldn't let another child have my life, ever.  "I will raise our children without the help of the so-called Venatori community.  I will be both father and mother if I have to be.  I will give you your blood line.  I will insure the survivablity of he Venatori race.  I will accept that my children may never have children.  But if they think for one minute that I will let my children die, or be raised by the Venatori without my guidance I will become Exuli.  I will remove my gift from the bloodline of the Venatori all together.  They will accept or they will not have my genes for thier use."

Dae'lin let out a gasp.  I could see fear and sadness in her eyes.  She nodded as she reached for the door knob.  "I will relay the message.   You are too important to lose, they will accept."

I removed myself and the patterns that barred her escape from me.  I saw pity in her eyes.  "For whatever it's worth, I'm sorry."

I shook my head, "Forget it.  You have my terms."

I wanted to bite bullets, everything that had calmed me before was gone.  A good nights rest, an understanding with my father, a decent work out - all of it gone and there was nothing but memories to calm my anger.  And I couldn't even relive the memories because they hurt just as much.  The wanting of Dorian, the need to jump with him, the feel of his body against mine.  I wanted him but...he didn't want me.  I sighed and pushed the thoughts away and focused back on Dae'lin.

"And Dae'lin, don't try so hard next time.  You are so just fine the way you are, even after a work out I'm sure."  I grined playfully, "And there is much less clothes to take off then too."

She yelled, "Nox."  She hit me on the arm as I smiled lewedly at her, "You are the worst ever.  I don't know how you talk so many girls to your bed."

I grinned, "I didn't have to talk too hard to get you in my bed."  She hit me again and I laughed, "Well I didn't."

Dae'lin sighed and lifted on her tip toes and kissed my cheek.  "I suppose you are right." She grinned mischeviously at me, "How hard did you talk to get into Dorian's bed?"

I winked at her, "I don't kiss and tell."  I couldn't exactly tell her nothing had happened, it would through my reputation out the door.  But the rumor would kill Dorian's.  It was a no win situation.

Dae'lin giggled, "So you did kiss him.  Should I be jealous"

I frowned, "We didn't kiss but yes you should be jealous." I wanted Dorian, I didn't want her.  I smiled to lighten the mood.  "Let me know how it goes."  

Dae'lin nodded, "I'm truly sorry Nox."

I nodded, "Don't worry about it."

I watched as Dae'lin left.  I knew why she didn't want to be a mother, but it had nothing to do with her way of life, it had to do with her petition for marriage.  She wanted to get married to a minorem and he was steralized so no kids.  She didn't want to flaunt it in his face.  I was okay with that.  

I wanted to know what Dorian thought about the situation.  I almost called him.  I wanted to hear his voice, I needed to.  I should call him.

I heard Dae'lin call out after me, "You aren't supposed to be checking me out Nox.  I hope to be married soon."

I nodded and grinned, "Like that has ever stopped me, Duckling."

I walked into the bathroom and started the shower just as a knock sounded at his door.  "Oy."

I turned off the water and walked out to the front door.  I was never going to get a shower.  I opened the door and Levi pushed his way inside, "Can I show you something?"

"Be my guest."  I was glad he'd come to me, and more importantly I was glad he was practicing.  

He looked around and laughed, "This is a boring room.  So not what I expected."

I laughed too, "It is and it's only temporary."

Levi nodded and sat down on the edge of my bed.  He put his hands in front of him, "I've been practicing.  I know I'm not supposed to but..."

In one hand Levi held a small smooth stone.  Levi morphed the pattern in his other hand to recreate the rock perfectly.  I was impressed, it wasn't just a replica it was identical down to the life sparks inside.  I grinned at Levi, "Well done."

I created a simple singular flame in my hand, "And this?"

Levi held his hand out and replicated the dancing flame without a flaw.  He struggled a little but he saw the patterns, "You see the patterns?"

Levi nodded, "I always have.  I just didn't understand.  I thought I was seeing things.  But when I listened to those kids described what they saw you do.  I was like, I see that.  I see you differently, you move differently.  Different than Mr. Hill or Dorian or any of my other instructors."

I laughed, "That's because I'm Cesari.  You do the same thing."

Levi nodded, "I have a class to get to.  Can we talk later?"

I nodded, "That's what I'm here for."  I was happy to help Levi.

Levi nodded, "Alright."  And just as he had arrived Levi was gone out of my bedroom door.  My mood was elevated again.  I glanced at the shower and shrugged.  I was never going to get a shower so I changed my shirt and picked up the files and headed to the Archives to do my research that Kai had approved.  I guess I had work to do now.
# Family
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 11:00AM_

I started down to the archives with a clean shirt on, it was tame again by my standards, and hopefully to those in the archives too.  My hoodie was unzipped but I could zip it if necessary.  But my walk got interrupted by a phone called.  "Hello?"  I hoped it was Dorian, though I don't know why I wanted him to call me.  I felt like a 15 year old girl but the small voice that answered had me frowning.

"Yeah Nate, I'll be right down."  My data was ready for me, he'd gotten to it sooner than I'd expected.  Instead of stopping at the Archives floor I headed down to the basement and Nate's "bat cave"

Nate was hunkered down behind his desk while a familiar frame stood in front of him.  I wasn't exactly sure if I was happy or scared to see my father.  I wasn't a praying man, but I hoped my father was in a better mood. 

The kid looked up at me and frowned as he saw me in the doorway.  Kai turned around and smiled, "Fancy meeting you here."  Had it been a ploy?

I grinned at my father in hopes to disarm him.  "I just came to get the data from my destroyed laptop."

Nate quickly handed me the jump drive he'd put the data on and cleared his throat nervously, "I just copied the documents, movies, pictures and music, nothing else."  The boy was clearly nervous.  He turned a nice shade of red as he remembered what I'd said I had on my harddrive.  I laughed to myself.

Kai turned around to see the boy blushng and the red deepened, "What's that all about?"  He asked me as he turned around.

I laughed, "I told him I had porn, girls I filmed on there."  Kai's eyes narrowed, "I swear there was nothing on there.  I told him so."

Nate started spuluttering.  I chuckled, "I'm sorry dude.  It was a joke."

Kai shook his head, "You like to step in it don't you?"

I grinned, "The more the better.  It keeps people guessing.  And I don't look foolish when others try to make me look like a fool.  I do a damned fine job of it."

Kai nodded for me to follow him out.  He turned to Nate, "Keep up the good work and thanks for tht bit of tech help.  It's greatly appreciated." 

Nate nodded and beamed with pride as his grandfather praised him.  I could see how it could make one smile.  Kai started out the door, "You were done?"

I held up my flash drive, "Just getting my harddrive."

We walked in silence for a while.  Kai interrupted it, "So... Dorian?"

I looked at him with a questioning look.  He smiled at me, "I'm not stupid.  Rumors run around here like wild fire.  And I happened to see you leaving his room this morning before stopping at the gym door."

I sighed, "Nothing happened."

Kai gave me a perplexed look.  "Why not?"  

"I don't kiss and tell Kai."  I laughed, "But since when did you become interested in my sex life?"  I didn't expect an answer it didn't really matter.

Kai answered anyway.  "Since the wife of my best friend died."

I nodded,  "Death does that.  But why do you care now?  I'm still everything you hate about me."

Kai frowned.  "Hate is a very strong word."  There was silence as we ascended the stairs.  "They don't need more problems Nox."  I  made to protest that I wasn't going to cause problems, but Kai held up his hand, "Let me finish first.  I know you don't intend to cause problems.  But they tend to follow you around.  Dorian is in a fragile state."

As if I didn't know that already.  I mean the man broke down and cried in my arms.  I think I knew exactly what state he was in.  I had to interrupt, "Kai, he's just a friend.  Nothing happened.  I'm not stupid or uncaring and I sure as hell don't want to hurt Dorian.  I **like** Dorian."  And I meant that more than I thought possible.  Somehwere between him rejecting me and this moment I had accepted the fact that I wanted to be with Dorian.  I know it was my insecurities pulling me towards the scent of safety, but I really did want to be more with Dorian -  more than anyone else I had ever been with.

Kai nodded, "And I don't want you to get hurt either."  There was sadness in Kai's voice, "But that it isn't the whole truth.  Dae'lin told me what happened to you as a child."

"Fuck!" I could feel the anger rising, Dae'lin couldn't keep her damned mouth shut.  "It doesn't matter, there is nothing you can do about it now."

Kai sighed, "There was and I did."

I stopped without thinking where I was.  I could feel the fear and the pain and everything that Garrett had ever inflicted up on me.  I could see him in my minds eye coming after me.  I could feel him beating me again.  I whispered, "What did you do?"

Kai took a few steps back down as he'd climbed a few stairs after I'd stopped.  He looked at me in my state of panic and he put his hand on my arm,  "He was exiled.  Dae'lin stopped me from doing what I intended to do."  Kai's anger was written all over his face.  "You and I may not get along Nox.  But you ARE my blood, and no one treats my blood the way Garrett treated you."

I stood paralyzed with fear.  Garrett would know I told, would know I caved.  I swallowed hard, I felt like I was five again.  Kai stared at me "You aren't alone anymore."

I shook my head and whispered, "You shouldn't have done that."  

Kai looked lost, even more lost than I felt.  I sank to the stair my feet were on and turned to sit.  I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.  Garrett...

Kai sat with me.  He asked in a quiet voice, "Do I need to call someone?"

I shook my head.  I would be fine.  I had to calm myself down.  I took a deep breath and pushed away the fear.  It was the only thing I could do.  The ache in my back persisted, the phantom strikes always lingered.  I could still see them in my head, but I ignored them.  I stood up and whispered, "You should have killed him."

I started up the stairs and when Kai caught up he grabbed my arm and out of habit I pulled it from his grasp.  I yelped, "Please don't touch me right now."

Kai raised an eyebrow, "Is it that bad kid?"

I turned to look at my father, "You have no idea how bad it gets."  I sighed, "I wish Dae'lin hadn't told you. She can't keep her damn mouth shut."

Kai shook his head, "She cares, that's all."

My voice was quiet and distant, "She only wants to do her duty.  Garrett did his job.  He did his duty."  I spat out the words, "I don't spark out of fear.  I don't spark out of anger."  I leaned in and my voice grew dark, "He beat the spark out of my flesh.  I learned control.  I am who I am because of him.  He did his duty too."  I stalked off.

Now I was pissed.  But I'd take that over afraid, anything but afraid.  I wasn't some five year old kid to be pushed around.  My father caught up to me again this time he didn't try to touch me.  "Talk to me Nox.  What can I do?"

I stopped.  "Kai. There is nothing you can do.  You can't go back in time and change things.  You can't protect me from myself.  It's something **I** have to do for myself.  Even if you could go change it, I don't want you to.  I am me because of him.  I don't hide behind the fact that he beat me Kai.  I told no one.  Am I damaged from it?  Yes.  Am I broken?  Yes.  But I **am** me.  I won't change me cause you think I deserve pity.  I like who I am.  It took years upon years of talking with Margo about it, but I'm okay with me now."  I sighed.  "You want to help?"

Kai nodded.  I took a step back, cleared the space between us, "Talk to Margo, figure out how you can fit into my mental health plan and goals.  I'll set you an appointment.  You can talk with her.  You are part of my issues despite not even having known me.  I will let you in, let you help but I don't know how Kai.  My default mode is to push you away.  To make you angry so I don't have to be hurt again."

Kai snickered, "For being someone who pushes away you are open about all of it."

I grinned, "You caught me in an off moment.  Instead of internalizing my shit you got to hear it.  This is my life, Kai.  I fight panic attacks every day.  I wake myself up with nightmares every night.  I don't sleep out of fear of my dreams.  I push people away so they don't hurt me.  These are the tip of the iceberg.  And yet no one knows half of it."

Kai frowned, "And now Dae'lin has voided your trust of her?"

I nodded, "Yes.  Just in time for the fucking breeding program negotiations."

Kai sighed, "I will see to it that your demands are met, and I will impinge a few additional on them."

"Why would you do that?"

Kai grinned, "Because I'm your father and they owe me a few favors.  Don't concern yourself with them."  Kai put his arm around me tenatively and when I didn't shrug him off he pulled me close.  "I ask only one thing of you.  I want to know my grandkids like I didn't get to know you."

I smiled, "Of course."  

Kai nodded in the direction of the doors we were about the pass, "This is me.  Nox..."  He waited until I looked at him.  "Let me know when I should go see your therapist."

I nodded, "I'll text you the details."  Kai nodded and headed onto the floor he had left me on.  I started my way up to the Archives, I would finally get some work done.

# It Changes Everything
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 11:30AM_

I finally made it back to the Archives, it was nearly noon and I hadn't made any progress on what Kai asked me to look into.  But that was hardly my fault.  Before I started I figured it was a good time to call Margo's assistant and set up a time for her and my father to meet.

I dialed her number from memory.  I called her that often before there was such a thing as a cell phone.  I wasn't even that old, I'd had a cell phone since I was in my early teens.  But I called Margo more as a child then I did now.  And I still called her regularly.

I called her direct line, but it apparently forwarded to Megan's desk.  The chipper voice answered.  "Dr. Silverman's office, how can I help you?"

I grinned, "Hey Megan.  Margo's busy?"

Megan laughed, "A big client is in a three hour session.  She is not to be disturbed."

"That's fine, I need to set up an appointment for my father to sit down with her and chat about me and how he can _fit_ into things."

I could hear Megan tapping away at the keyboard.  "She's got an hour next week Wednesday for a lunch discussion, since I assume he's not here to talk to her about his issues."

I laughed, "Not to my knowledge.  Can you have the paperwork ready when I get in next week so she can legally let him see my file?  He'll ask, he's as anal about things as Dorian and Dae'lin."

Megan tapped away at her keyboard again, "I can.  It also looks like you need to update your permission for that all around.  Who else should have access so I can set that paperwork up?"

I thought about it.  There was no reason for anyone to ever need to look at my files except me again.  I wasn't a minor.  But ... habits, "Just my father and Dorian."  Dae'lin lost the rights when she told my secrets to someone else, but I didn't say that outloud - I hoped.

I could hear Megan smile, "Alright Nox, I've got that taken care of.  Next Wednesday, Jun 24th at 12pm, Dr. Silverman will see your father.  Would you like me to send you a reminder for your calendar?"

"Yeah, I can forward that to Kai."

"I will send it to him as well, to save you the trouble.  Is there anything else I can do for you?"

"Nope, my standing appointment is booked still?"

Megan laughed, "You know very well that Margo would not overbook that slot.  You've been seeing her every Monday at 9:30 for 16 years.  It's penciled in until the end of time."

I grinned, "Just making sure.  I'll see you then."  And then I hung up the phone and sighed, it was time to actually get back to work with that taken care of.  It was nothing that had to be done right then, but I'd likely forget and I'd hate to disappoint my father.  And I really was procrastinating.  I had to do research, the most dull of things a venatori hunter can do.  But it was necessary.

I pulled the large book of Exuli towards me and wished I had my laptop to access the digital records.  I could hunt down a free to use one but that would waste time I could be doing this.

Thankfully there were books for indexing and I was able to find all the Exuli currently living in Chicago.  There were five families - including Levi's.  It was a small fact that I had forgotten and that nagging feeling like I'd missed something stopped.  It was the missing peice. And that meant I had to go find Levi.

I grabbed all of their files and set out to Dae'lin's office to have someone track down their whereabouts, but I didn't really think it was necessary.  But it was Dae'lin's  or Gary's job to do this and Dae'lin was just easier.  

The annoying ring tone of an unknown caller swept through the stair well.  I was getting tired of not having people in my contacts, I was going to have to fix that.  I answered, "Yeah?"

"Nox?  Have you heard?"  A familiar voice sounded on the verge of anger and concern yet I couldn't place the voice.  

I shrugged as I continued my ascent to Dae'lin's office, "Heard what?"

"Your father..."

I interrupted, "What about my father? I just saw him."

"He's...", my phone beeped in my ear and I pulled it away to see who it was.  It was another unknown number.  

I had to interrupt whoever it was, "Hold on a sec, someone's trying to beep through."  I heard the voice stammering as I put them on hold.  "Yeah?"

On the other side of the phone I heard two voices.  "Turn around."  I recognized the voice, but my mind was already focusing on the heavy breathing of the unknown caller.

I knew that voice, just the sound of it brought back memories from last night.  Dorian...  He spoke softly, "You don't have to do this Levi."

The kid groaned, "Yeah, I've heard that before.  Right before my parents tried to send me here."  I heard a commotion on the other side of the line and Levi shouting, "I'll just do it this way then.  I didn't want to see it in your face."

I don't know what happened but I heard a cry of pain and then footsteps running away.  FUCK!  Dorian... "Shit, Dorian." I shouted into the phone.  I didn't even know if Dorian was alive still.

I was frantic, I fumbled through the apps on my phone and found the tracking application.  Not all monsters were afraid of tech, some that were newly turned were actually pretty tech savvy, it came in handy.

I started the application and then remembered the other caller.  I switched my phone to their call, "Sorry.  But make it quick.  I have to go find Dorian."

"What's wrong with my son?"  He heard the worry in my voice.

FUCK!  Emilio!  "I'm on the line with him.  Something happened, a kid he knows did something.  I'm tracking his phone now.  What's wrong with my father?"

Emilio's voice was seething, "You father is in surgery, he's been stabbed."

"Fuck!  I'll call you back when I've got Dorian."  I hung up I didn't wait for an answer.  I switched back to the tracking app and I followed that signal to Dorian.  It wasn't hard inside this building, we had repeaters and the likes everywhere to make sure the wireless signal was strong everywhere including the basement.

My mind reeled with possiblities.  I didn't know what to expect, I had patterns at the ready just in case Levi was still there.  I knew I had to find Dorian quickly.  I found Dorian lying in a pool of his blood.  I was no healer by any means but I saw the slowly expanding blood stain on his pale blue button up shirt and knew that would kill him later if the stab wound didn't.  I smirked out of habit and Dorian looked at me with relief, but he did give me a questioning look, asking me what's so funny with just his eyes.  I smiled down at him as I pulled my nice clean shirt off and bent down to press it to his bleeding wound.  "I was just thinking that the stain on your shirt was going to kill you later."  He smiled but it looked like it hurt and his head fell into my leg.  "You've lost a lot of blood."

I grabbed my phone and called Emilio back.  "WHAT!" He answered.

I tried not sound bitchy too, it was not a good day for his family - mine either it seemed, "Dorian's been stabbed.  We are outside the elevator on Dorian's level.  Hurry, he's lost a lot of blood."  I hung up the phone as I started hearing Emilio shouting orders around whereever he was.

"Dorian.  You have to stay with me, man."  Damn, he had to stay with me.  "You can't die on my like this.  Not with blood all over.  Old age would fit you sooo much better."  I tried to keep Dorian awake.  I felt him holding in a laugh.  "Oh come on, you can do better than that."

Dorian's voice was low and croaked, "It hurts."

I lifted his head, "Do you trust me?"

He nodded slightly and I smiled at him.  "It might hurt."  I did something I had only done once in my life.  I had to stop the bleeding.  I was no biologist or doctor, but I knew enough.  Enough that maybe he wouldn't die. I didn't do any thing really.  I just gave Dorian's body fuel and resources for the little sparks of life to use.  Raw resources it could use to heal itself.  I feed the patterns to it.  An endless supply.  It drank my power like a dry sponge.  I could feel it sapping my strength but I could handle that if Dorian lived right now.

Dorian cringed against me biting back a howl of pain.  "It's okay.  I'm here.  No one will know."

But the elevator dinged open and Emilio and a medic team rushed out basically calling me a liar.  I was pushed out of the way with ease.  I stood up and towered over the team as they worked on Dorian.  I heard one say "Its not as bad as we were told."  There was releif in her voice.  My only hope was that I hadn't made it worse.

They got Dorian on a stretcher and started wheeling him away but he grabbed my arm and pulled me along until they stopped.  

"We have to talk." Dorian's voice was soft and he sounded as bad as he looked.

I grinned. "I figured as much."

He nodded but they pulled him away before he could say more.  "You can talk later."

I watched as Dorian was wheeled into the elevator.  He smiled at me, reassuring me.  Always the protector.  The look on my face must be bad.  

Emilio put his hand on my arm.  "We'll get these bastards."  I turned to him with a frown.  He was pissed.  So was I.  

"How is my father?"  I asked, I knew I didn't sound as concerned as I really was.

"In surgery.  We won't know for a while."  He looked at me with questions in his eyes. "What did you do?"  

I shook my head, "Saved him."

Emilio pulled me into a tight embrace and held me.  I hesitated before putting my arms around him.  He smelled of pine and a sweetness I couldn't identify.  He made me think of Dorian.  He whispered, "Thank you."

We stayed like this for countless minutes.  I lost track of time while the senior Vega tried to collect himself in my arms.  My thoughts drifted to Dorian and I couldn't help the silent tear that fell.  If he hadn't called me?  If I was just a little longer?  What if I didn't answer the phone?  All the wrong things kept coming to me.  

Emilio finally pulled away with am embarrassed grin.  "Sorry about that."  

I grinned "No problem.  I won't tell a soul."  

Emilio gave a curt laugh, "At least not your father."

I smiled, "No one."

"You are too kind."

"Fair is fair."  I wiped my cheeks with my fingers and Emilio nodded with a weak laugh.  I didn't really care one way or the other but Dorian was so much like his father I knew Emilio would care.

"I'm going to the camera room to find these bastards." 

I nodded.  "I'm going to check around here a while.  Levi was here I might be able to find him.  He couldn't have gotten too far.  We need to initiate lock down."

Emilio nodded.  "I'll call that in.  Find the bastards that is hurting our families."

And that was what I intended to do.  Hurting my father was one thing, but Dorian... that was a completely different story.  It changed everything.# The Hunt Begins
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 12:40PM_

It was difficult to say where Levi might go.  I really didn't have a clue.  A cold draft reminded me my shirt was now with Dorian and I didn't have a hoodie with me.  I could walk around only so long before even I got tired of the looks I'd received.  The epic bruise was still yellow and green from yesterday.  And the rather large scar running across my chest always received weird glances.  I was proud of my scars, I survived!  That's what they meant to me, but to others they were a reminder of what I was.  It didn't matter if all venatori hunters had scars, I was half human.  I reminded them they weren't all they were cracked up to be.  I sighed at my own inner thoughts and pushed them away.

There were too many directions to check.  My plan while good in theory was not going to work.  I needed a starting point.  I needed to go to the cameras too.  But first I should probably get a shirt.  

I started for my room.  My clothes were still lying on the floor and bed in a heap.  I still hadn't gotten around to cleaning anything but the towels up after the trashing they'd received.  But that was a problem for another time.

I unlocked my door and found a clean shirt.  It was probably the only branded shirt I owned.  Someone had given it to me with the comment that said something like So you have a clean shirt to wear.  In other words it was not offensive.  But I liked the color, it said indigo when you looked it up online, but it was blue to me.  It would work.

I pulled it over my head and tried to remember what room Emilio used the last time and hoped that he was there.  Thankfully I remembered how to get there.  I still didn't bother with remembering the room number once I'd found it.  I had been correct Emilio was there scanning through an area I didn't recognize.  Emilio jumped when I opened the door.  He had a gun pointed at me before I could even say anything.  I put my hands up out of instinct.  Emilio shook his head, "Don't do that to me."

"Sorry."  I sat down in the other chair in front of the screens.  "Any luck?"

Emilio shook his head.  "Not yet.  I can't bring myself to watch Dorian's attack."

I nodded.  "Alright.  I'll do it."

Emilio put his hand on my shoulder, "We can get someone else to do it."

I shook my head, "Nah that's okay.  I want to do this."

Emilio frowned but let me be.  He went back to his own work.  I had learned a thing or two from the last time I'd done this.  It was much easier to navigate through the cameras this go around.  I hoped I didn't have to do this too often.

I easily found the camera, there was someone there cleaning up the blood stains.  I had to give it to the venatori they were quick on clean up.  Stupid humor filled my mind, 'clean up aisle 6'.  I shook my head at myself.  I had to focus, but I knew I was procrastinating.  I didn't really want to watch what happened to Dorian.  

I heard the alarms.  Finally some idiot finally got off their ass and initiated lock down.  Emilio looked up and nodded, "Bout damn time.  That took forever."

Lock down was meant to happen quickly if you could talk the right person into the idea that lock down was necessary.  Two stabbings didn't seem to pull as much weight as it should have.  If it hadn't been Vega and Viddens I was beginning to wonder if it would have happened at all.  How many innocents would have to die before the council would get off their ass.  The Imperordo was worse than the US government at times - red tape sucked!

Emilio got up, "Bahtroom break."  I nodded in acceptance.  Necessity was necessity no matter the situation.  It would give me time to get past Dorian's attack without worrying about Emilio seeing his son being gutted.  I swallowed back the bile that rose in my throat.  I wasn't looking forward to it either, but I did my job and I started the feed backwards.

It was interesting watching things in reverese, but watching myself was something else.  At least I wasn't listening to the feeds.  Though that likely could help in the future.  I wondered if we recorded sound?  I would have to ask later.

I watched everything happen in reverse.  I saw the paramedics come in with Dorian on the stretcher.  Lay him back down.  I watched myself being pulled back to him and kneeling down.  I speed it up slightly I didn't want to watch what I'd done in reverse but really the camera couldn't see anything.  I saw the blood pool lessen and return to Droain's body.  I wished whole heartedly that I could do this for real, reverse the course of time and never let Dorian out of my sight.

I watched as Dorian was alone afterwards.  He was in pain, gasping for air, and then he got better and better with each breath.  He stood up awkwardly and I saw Levi step into the screen.  I watched in reverse everything that happened.  I watched as Dorian took his phone and dialed my number from memory.  Damn his photographic memory.  But Levi was yelling at him and Dorian was ignoring him it looked.  I wished for audio at that moment, I sucked at reading lips and in reverse it was even worse.  I saw the initial confrontation and I started the feed forward.  I watched everything again at normal speed in the correct order.  

It looked like Levi was telling Dorian to call me.  This was a trap.  I was a target.  I looked over to tell Emilio but he still hadn't returned.  I shrugged, biological functions took a while sometimes.  I went back to my work.  I watched as Levi looked directly at the camera with a smile I could only call as evil.  He was taunting me.  He put his hand on the wall and left a bloody hand print.  How had I not noticed that before?  I was going to have to pay better attention.  But Emilio hadn't either.  

I started fast forwarding and folloiwng on different cameras.  I hadn't realized it but time on the machine had finally caught up to real life.  I knew where Levi was right now but I had no one to watch the monitors to tell me where to go afterwards.  He was going to move, he was moving now.  Where was Emilio?

As if his name in my thoughts summoned him, Emilio stumbled out of a room holding his hands to his sides.  I saw blood blooming along his body.  Stupid, stupid man!

I needed help.   I called Dae'lin, but she didn't answer her phone.  Fuck!  So I called Gary.  I had to look up his number in my phone it wasn't exactly one I called frequently.

"Kenyon here."

"Gary, I need someone in Security Room #310."  Wow, I actually remembered the number on the door.  "Emilio's down.  I have his 20.  But I need people to track at least two suspects.  The more the merrier."

"Nox?  Yeah, alright.  I'll send someone up.  But you should be with your father."

"Fuck that.  Emilio needs help I'm going to him.  The feeds are currently centered on the door I know they are in right this moment.  You'll need to track them from there."

"Nox, your father."

I sighed, "My father is in surgury, when he gets out I'll happily go see how he's doing when he wakes up or this is over.  Until that time I'm doing my job."

Gary sighed, "You are too like your father."

"Thank you.  Send someones here now."  I hung up I didn't wait for an answer as I got the location of the camera and sprinted towards the doors.  I dialed the internal emergency number.  If they could beat me all the better.  

"What's your emergency?"

"Emilio Vega has been injured, stabbed I assume.  36th floor, camera hub 3.  I'm enroute, but if you get their first be careful, assailants still might be there."  I moved quickly through the building.  I wasn't hampered by security, it made me wonder who was on my side up there watching me.  Someone had to be watching.

"Can I get your name?"  The woman on the other side asked after she'd relayed the message to someone in the room.

"Nox Sétanta."  I clipped as I rode the elevator.  I could feel my own inner panic rising, but I pushed it down, there were other things to worry about right now - like Emilio Vega dying like my father, or Dorian.  I couldn't let that happen on my watch.

"Alright Nox, we have dispatched a medical crew they have an eta of 3 minutes.  What's your eta?"

"With the help of whoever is up watching my progress I should be there as soon as the elevator drops me on the floor.  It's not too far away I think."  I hoped.

"Stay on the line with us."  I nodded but knew they couldn't see it.

"Alright.  I'm putting my phone in my pocket though I need my hands."  I wished for my gun right then.  Why hadn't I taken it with me?  Because I wasn't intending to hunt right now, I was in research mode.  I hated research mode, but it was preferential to this particular situation right now.  I should have grabbed it when I went to get a clean shirt.  Stupid, preoccupied mind!

I heard an alright from the other side of the phone as slipped it into my back pocket.  The elevator stopped and I moved to the side so that I wasn't in direct line of fire.  Thankfully bullets didn't fly or any patterns either, I was in the clear for the moment as I tried to remember to breathe.  But it felt wonderful to feel the thrill of the hunt.  I truly did live for this.# Tripping the Trap
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 3:15PM_

The cooridor was empty, except for Emilio lying against the wall holding his hands to his side.  The sight was too familiar and I wanted to wretch.  Was this how it looked when someone found Kai?  I wondered at that moment how my father was doing?  How as Dorian?  My mind started to wander and I needed to focus on the issue at hand.  I was half way to Emilio when the elevator dinged again and the medics were there.

Emilio had caught sight of me but his head had sagged to the ground and I knew that things were looking bad.  I couldn't see the wound.  There was too much blood.  He grabbed my hand and pressed it to my body.  He understood even though I'd not said anything.  His gift was reading people.  I guess it came in handy even when you were down and out.  

I couldn't see through the spurting blood.  I didn't really try much but I gave the wound what power I could.  I could feel it sucking my resources away just as easy as it had with Dorian.  The medics arrived and pulled me from Emilio.  I let them direct me away, but my power still flowed to the wound.  I wished I could see it working.  The patterns were writhing under the strain.  I wanted to see but there were people in the way.

The same medic that had been there with Dorian was tending to his father.  She looked over at me.  "That's twice you've been here.  Who are you?"

I grinned at her.  "Does it matter?"

She stood up, "As a matter of fact it does."  She strode towards me with purpose and looked up me with a stern look.  "I won't ask again.  Who are you?"

I sighed.  "My name is Nox Sétanta."

The female medic frowned just as a noise caught my attention down the hall.  The far door had closed.  I smiled at the woman.  "Sorry.  Gotta go."

I left her at a run.  I heard her yelling after me, but she wasn't chasing me.  She'd have caught me if she tried.  I wasn't going to be able to do this alone.  But I found a trail of blood on the rail leading up the stairs.  At least he was being stupid - or laying that trap I was fairly sure was the reason they'd hurt my father and Dorian.  Dorian had called me.  They wanted me to find him.  Not just anyone - me.

I slowed to a walk and had several patterns ready to use the moment they were needed.  It was draining doing so much at one time, with two draining energy sinks already done.  I was weakening.  I patted my pocket to make sure my zippo was where it was supposed to be and I was happy to find that it was.  I was going to need it I was almost certain of it.

I had to think this through now.  I was alone, with another Cesari and I didn't know how much Levi knew and what he had been pretending about.  He was adept at making things happened, it didn't matter if it was the right way or not.  I kept my eyes out for signs.  I knew he was leaving them.  A few blood stains on the railing.  A smear on the wall here and there.  He wanted me to follow him.

I wrapped myself in a wall of air.  It was easy enough to maintain.  But it was going to become cumbersome to deal with as I grew tired.  The less I could expend the better I would be, but I really didn't feel like getting stabbed or shot at.  I wished for my gun at that moment, the comforting steal in my hand would be nice.

There was a smear of blood on the doorknob and I knew I was on the floor they wanted me to be, but then again there wasn't much more up to go - just the penthouse remained and you could only reach that by the elevator.  I was wondering how these people were getting around security measure.  Maybe it wasn't a helpful lookout watching me.  Fuck!  There was another potential threat now.  I was walking deeper and deeper into shit.

I walked through the door with caution.  I wasn't exactly sure what to expect once I got into the hall way.  There was nothing out of the ordinary.  There was of course a smear of blood leading me into the trap.  I wished for a way to hide my patterns, just another thing on my wish list of things.

A let my senses go, they had saved me a great number of times and I was going to need them.   I walked slowly, letting my other senses take over more than my eye sight.  I waited for a sound or a scent to drift my direction to indicate danger.  Sometimes you could smell fear, but I got nothing.  Past a few doors there was another smear of blood.  I could feel the anxiety rising but I knew this was a trap. I just wasn't sure I wanted to trip it alone.   Having my dad or Emilio here would have topped my day off just right, but both now were sitting in the infirmary waiting on whatever their prognosis was.  

I took a deep breathe and I kept going.  I heard a door click shut to my right and I slowly walked that direction.   I weilded whatever weapons I could with a quick thought.  I was well practiced in this part of my job.  My gift was my natural weapon.

I opened the door and a man rushed out.  He was much older than Levi.  He was covered in blood, Emilio must have gotten a good shot in.  Though I couldn't see from wehre.  Maybe it wasn't his own blood.  He tried to topple me but instead slammed into the wall of wair and bounced backwards with a stunned look on his face.  

I heard a voice over a comms unit.  They were communicating, they were using our own systems against us.  There was more than one inside man, there had to be one in the control room.  I wished I could signal someone else.  But I was alone.  Such was my life it seemed.

He blinked at me and scowled before he took off running down the hall away from me.  I threw a wall of air in front of him and he bounced backwards again, this time falling on his ass.  I smirked.  

He turned around and got in a ready stance, like I was going to go hand to hand with him.  I let my smirk turn to a smile.  He took a deep breathe and he rushed me.  One last chance for him to stop.  I dodged to the side pushing him with a gush of air against the wall as he ran past me - much like a matador did to a bull.  He howled in pain and fustration.  

He pulled his knife from his belt and charged me.  I sighed.  Stupid man.  I reached out with my power as he came at me and I wrapped a cord of air around his neck and heard a distinct pop as he continued forward. His body fell slack to the floor and I knew without checking that he was dead.

I tagged a locator on his body.  Another thing I kept in my pocket at all times.  Sometimes you just needed to be ready to track something as a hunter.

I was still seeing signs of a trap, there were smears still heading the direction I had been going.  They were going to the roof.  Why?  There was no escape from the roof... Unless Levi intended to jump.  If he left the building we weren't going to find him.  He had to pay for this.  

I started sprinting again.  I took the stairs up two at a time. I didn't even bother with making sure I was going the wrong way.  From here ther was only one way up and there was only two ways down.  

Once at the door to the roof I saw a bloody hand print on the door.  Levi had blood on his hands.  Likely Dorian's.  The heat in my body rose, the mere thought that Levi had hurt Dorian made me angry.

I opened the door and I saw Levi looking over the edge.  He turned around with a grin on his face.  I wanted to punch him so bad.  Now I knew how people felt when I did it to them.  But it probably wouldn't stop me from doing it - habits were very hard to break.

"There is no place to go Levi."  

He scoffed at me.  "I watched you do this before.  It didn't look that hard."  

Little did he know.  It took me a long time to master the fall and the landing.  I had a few broken bones during the learning phase.  

I took a few steps forward and Levi threw a fireball at me which bounced off the air shield I still had up.  "What can't see the shield?"

Levi didn't answer he just jumped over the edge.  He had no wings of air, he had nothing he intended to do it on the fly, he was stupid. 

I ran to the edge and jumped over.  I formed wings of air but in order to catch him I couldn't wrap them around me yet.  I hated going head first but catching him was imperative.  I speared into him and we both started spiralling down.  I flung out my arms and the air started to slow but it had been 4 seconds since we started.  We didn't have time to slow.  Levi hit me in the face and I lost the ground pattern.  I could have fought back but I had to slow down.  This was too fast my anxiety rachetted up every second we continued at our accelerated speed.  I thickened the air and softened the ground and prayed that I had done enough.  2.... 1... and then I felt my body shatter upon impact.






# A Month Later
_Tuesday, July 14, 2015 4:45PM_

There was nothing but pain in the darkness.  And when there was no pain there were my nightmares.  I writhed in fear but my body could not move.  Garrett's face was clear in my minds eye.  I watched as I was unable to move out of his wrath.  The tentacles of air smashed across my body leaving huge scars that dripped with blood so dark I knew I was going to die.  

And then the peace came on wings of cinnamon and vanilla.  A soft current of pine and my fears drifted away.  Safe.  Home.  But as quickly as it came it went again.  The darkness crept back in and I felt nothing but fear.  Over and over the cycle continued.  Searing pain.  Fear.  Peace and then directly back into pain.  I wanted to die until those few moments of peace came and I knew there was something to live for.

The pain was less this go around.  I felt a cool breeze on my cheek.  I cracked my eyes open, the light was too bright.  I clamped my eyes shut.  My mouth was dry, I couldn't open my mouth, I tried to lick my lips but it didn't do anything.  I heard a movement next to me.  I heard a familiar voice yell, "He's awake."

I tried to open my eyes but the light was still to bright.  There was a shuffling and then there was less light.  I blinked my eyes I couldn't see anything but a blurry ceiling.  At least that's what I thought it was.  I couldn't move anything.  I saw a face above me, "Don't try to move."  I recognized the voice but I still couldn't make out the face and my mind was searching.  I couldn't make heads or tails of things.  I blinked furiously trying to see.  

The searing pain radiated through my body as I tried to move.  I felt hands on my legs, "Stay still son."

Son... Kai.  I blinked again and the images started to clear.  My father was sittting my side.  That was good.  Something tickled at my memory.  I should know something but it slipped from my mind as the pain made me pass out again.

The cycle started again.  Pain.  Fear.  Peace.  But each time through the pain seemed to lessen.  Pain.  And then the nightmare started again.  Garrett's face weilded glowing red eyes at me and I started awake and I felt that searing pain again.  I was sitting up in a hospital bed and I tried to yowl in pain but I croaked out nothing but a muffled groan. 

A woman rushed into the room.  She was wearing the white jacket of a doctor.  I saw her stethascope around her neck before she pushed be back to lie down.  Her voice was soft.  "Lay down Nox.  You shouldn't be moving.  I won't want to strap you down again.  Please stay still."

I complied. I didn't know why I couldn't move but the moment I did the pain lessened.  Or maybe that was the injection she shot into the IV in my arm.  I blinked up at her.  I vaguely recognized her and was about to say something when I felt my head lull to the side and my eyes slowly closed.  

The pain killers soon left my system as the nightmares took over.  I felt the slashes against my skin.  I could feel my skin knitting together.  It was a creepy crawling feeling as my body healed itself.  It was all over.  I could feel it everywhere like spiders were crawling all over.  I started awake but I didn't move.  My body or my mind remembered the pain from before.  My mouth was dry.  I tried to speak but nothing came out.  I tried again and managed a horse whisper "Water."

Someone next to me squacked. I could have sworn it was a baby.  I tried to turn my head but everything was so painful.  I felt a heavy weight put on my chest.  The soft scent of baby powder and baby wafted towards me.  I looked up at the clearning image in front of me.  "Hey babe.  Hold JJ for me I'll get the Doc and some water."

JJ?  Who the hell was JJ.  Jace had a new boy?  Son... Mia had her baby.  I looked down at the little one lying on my chest and grinned.  It hurt but I used air to undo the bounds on my arms and to hold the little one to me as I moved the bed to a sitting position.  Air was lovely tool when it hurt to do anything.  It hurt sitting but I was able to wrap my arms under JJ and look down at him.  My body ached everywhere.  But I seemed relatively intact.  

I wondered what day it was, how long I'd been asleep.  A woman in a white coat rushed into the room she looked frantic as I was siting there but she stopped at my bed side and was checking all the machines.  "How are you...." She looked at me with bright green eyes and I could see a million questions pass through them.  

I grinned at her.  "Doc."

A blush ran up her neck and to her ears.  I wasn't even trying to be seductive.  But she smiled back at me.  "Nox.  I'm Doctor Eriksen.  I've been looking after you since your fall."

I smirked.  "I didn't fall.  I jumped."

She gasped in horror.  "Do we need a suicide watch?"

I wanted to shake my head but I thought better of it.  "No ma'am.  I jumped to catch a bad guy.  Levi Hughes, did he make it?"

Jace walked in with a cup of ice chips heaping over the top.  "Dead, man.  He was on the bottom, between the fall and you landing on him he didn't make it."

I nodded.  "Dorian?  My father?  Emilio? How are they?"

Jace grinned at me like he knew something I didn't.  But it was the doc who answered.  "Both of the Vegas spent two days under observation.  Your father recovered well, neither Vega needed surgery despite the blood loss, the injuries were not enough to explain it."

I nodded and felt releif wash over me, everyone was okay.  I looked down at the sleeping kid in my arms and smiled at Jace.  "You make beautiful kids, man."

He laughed, "I do.  Don't I?"  He smiled proudly.  "But you look pretty good with a babe in your arms."  He winked at me suggestively.  I rolled my eyes at him and he laughed softly.  

The doc looked at the babe and frowned.  "I need to take a look at you.  He's going to have to go.  Your friend too."

"Ain't nothing Jace ain't seen before Doc."  My comment brought another blush to her face and I grinned.  Jace took his son from my arms and I felt colder than I had before.  I sighed, that wasn't going to happen to me for a while if I could barely move now.

But the doc never lost a beat, "Well either way I'd like him to leave."

I kept my mouth shut, I sorely wanted to add a sarcastic comment about wanting me all to herself.  Jace left with a wink, "I'll bring you back some food when I stop by after class."

My stomach rumbled at the mention of food, "Please."

The doc shook her head, "Not yet.  We don't want you to hurt yourself."

"Doc I'm starving.  Food can only help.  I'm talking just fine.  I don't think food is going to make things worse."

She shook her head and shooed Jace out of the door and shut it after him drawing the blinds and everything.  I couldn't help myself this time, "You really want alone time don't you?"  I was rewarded with another blush but she hastily went to flipping through her charts.  

When she finally found the right page the blush was gone, and she was all business.  "On June 16th you were admitted with severe injuries.  Injuries I'm not even sure a full Venatori could have recovered from."  She looked down at me with that teacher knows best stare as she delivered the next part, "But here you sit, unexplainable miracles later.  You are talking, moving and I'm pretty sure ready to get out of that bed.  We have to get more x-rays before I let you move around.  Before you eat solid food.  We don't want you to hurt yourself worse."

I laughed, "Worse than splatting on the ground at high velocity.  I felt every bone in my body shatter Doc.  There is no getting worse than that."

She gasped, "You felt it?"

I nodded, "I was awake, and completely conscious as I hit the ground."

"Poor boy."

I rolled my eyes.  "I'm alive that's all that matters."

"You are barely alive, Nox.  You should be dead like the other boy.  Why did you jump?"  She seemed curious about my reasons, like she didn't exactly beleive me.

"Levi, stabbed Dorian.  He had to pay.  If he got away by jumping - using something I taught him I'd never forgive myself."

"Dorian?"  She sounded shocked, "I didn't think you two were that close?"

"We aren't really.  But it was personal regardless."  I gave her a half smile, I didn't want to tell her how I really felt about him.  I wasn't completely sure what was real and what was the desire to want to be safe.  But was it so bad to want that?  I sighed.  

A nurse or x-ray tech, probably the latter, brought in a portable x-ray machine.  "Let's get you lying down again."  She reached over and held the button that lowered the bed flat.  I could feel her long carmel hair tickling my neck.  She smelled clean.  Like a trickle of water through a near dry creek bed.  I didn't know how to explain it really.  When I was lying flat on my back she let the tech do his job.  She stood back and I looked at her, really looked at her.  I gazed at the chaotic patterns around her.  They didn't know which way to go, or what to do.  I'd never seen an Eruditus with such chaos around them.  It made me look away. 

I stared at the ceiling while the x-ray tech arranged my long, apparently fragile limbs if his touch had anything to do with my state of hospitalization.  It was too long, too silent.  "So Doc, tell me the full extent of my injuries."

Her silence lingered on and I opened my eyes happy to see that my vision of her patterns had lessened and I could see her pretty green eyes again.  "That bad?"

She looked down at me from the screen.  "I'm sorry.  I'm not ignoring you, honest.  But you are a marvel.  Every bone is completely healed.  No Venatori heals like this.  What are you?"

I sighed, "Improbable."

"What?  She asked as the tech started wheeling away the machine.

I shook my head and winced in pain, "Nothing.  My injuries, what was I admitted with?"  Changing the topic was probably better.

She frowned, "Multiple fractures to nearly every bone in your body.  Severe organ damage.  Internal bleeding.  Everything you'd expect from a fall from an excessive height."

"And now?"

"As we expected the internal damage was extensive.  We didn't want to risk operating, we could only hope your body would heal it.  But no one expected you to survive.  And it's a month later and you are near to fully healed.  You are likely in pain from muscle atrophy and the healing process that's still going on."  She looked at me with amazement in her eyes, "You are a medical miracle."

I shook my head, "I'm not miracle.  Just Cesari."

She shook her head, "No you aren't JUST anything.  I would like to do extensive testing on you if you'll allow me."

I sighed, "Sure whatever."  I turned my head away from her and closed my eyes.  I was growing tired.

"That doesn't sound very energetic.  If you'd rather I didn't."  She was geniune in her feelings, but I was still leery of being a lab rat.  

But I didn't say that. "I'm just tired."  My stomach rumbled again, "And hungry."

"I will have them send you food right away."  She took one last look at the monitors and then at me and left my little room.  I closed my eyes and felt the gentle call of sleep take me down.  I was so tired.



# Confessions
_Tuesday, July 14, 2015 7:15PM_

Sleep brought on my normal nightmares with a soft interlude that woke me from my sleep.  I blinked my eyes open.  My mouth was parched, my stomach hurt.  I had no idea what time it was.  There were no clocks in my room.

I glanced to the side when I heard typing on the keyboard.  I grinned.  "Hey stranger, glad to see you up and moving about."  

Dorian jumped at the sound of my voice.  A look of relief washed over his features.  Worry was not a good look on Dorian, but his eyes were bright now.  "You too.  Jason said you were awake, but when I got here you'd passed back out again."

"Sorry.  The drugs they are giving make me tired I think."  I grinned playfully at him.

Dorian shook his head.  "We've been worried about you."

"Who's we?"  I asked, really how many people cared if I lived or died.

Dorian frowned.  "Everyone."

I rolled my eyes.  "Now that's a lie.  Everyone doesn't care about me."

Dorain stood up with a sigh, "You are ever so hard on yourself.  Specifically, those worried about you were first and foremost - me.  Your father and mine have been here nearly as much as I have.  Jace spends his lunch hour and some time before he goes home here.  The doctors and nurses are all dumbfounded by you."  He grinned at me like he was not at all surprised by my miraculous healing.  "There is probably a line waiting outside the Infirmary of all sorts of people waiting on you to get better so they can talk to you."

"Oh yay!  I'm a celerety now."  I rolled my eyes.  There were several bags and a tray of food on the table by the door.  "That all mine?"

Dorian looked at the table and nodded.  "You hungry?"  It was rhetorical because he hadn't even waited for me to answer before he picked up the bags and the tray and carried them over to the bedside rolling table.  He set the tray down first and then started pulling containers out of the bags.  "Jace, your dad, me and I think the Doc all brought you food.  I guess we all thought you would be hungry."

I laughed.  "I'm famished."

Dorian nodded.  "With all that energy you've been expending I'm surprised you aren't skin and bones, your body turning on itself."

"So you understand what's happening?"  I asked before stuffing a peice of bread in my mouth.  It was stale and soggy but it was food.

Dorian pulled the chair over and sat down.  "Not really.  I only know what I see."

The hospital food was just boring.  I opened one of the containers Dorian had unpacked and found a bow tie pasta with garlic lemon shrimp sauce.  It smelled to die for even though it was cold.  I searched the mess of stuff in front of me for a fork and didn't find one.  So I used my fingers.  

Dorian laughed and pulled a fork from the tray and handed it to me with a roll of his eyes.  "Thanks.  What do you see?"

Dorian smiled, "Patterns converging in on you.  Like a steady stream of them."

That's what I thought was the cause of my miraculous healing.  Though I wasn't sure how that worked without someone actively supplying me the raw resources.  I shrugged.  "Like what I did to you and Emilio?"

Dorian shook his head, "I don't know, I didn't see what you did to me."

I nodded and took the fork and drew it across my forearm.  Dorian jumped to my side but I told him, "Just watch."  I laid all the elements over my skin and Dorian watched as my scratch knitted itself back together faster than any Venatori.

He nodded but stared at my arm.  He ran his fingers over where it had been, smearing blood along my arm.  His touch sent shivers down my spine.  He had no idea what he did to me.  Dorian picked up the napkin and wiped his fingers then my arm and threw it in the red bin in the room.  "No need to worry someone else."  He said absently.

Dorian sat down still staring at my arm.  "Exactly like that."  He looked up at me with more questions.  "People are going to have a lot of questions."

I sighed, "The doc has already said she wants to run more tests.  I reluctantly agreed.  You will want to know more, I already expected that.  Do I really need to talk to more people?"

Dorian moved closer putting his hand on my arm, "This is unprecidented, people will want to know."

His touch was electric, my heart raced and I heard the monitors recording it.  I tried to pull my arm from him, "Please don't do that."  Dorian looked confused and then pulled his hand from arm.  I missed his touch.  I put the topic back on track, "I'm not some guinea pig to be tested and scored."

Dorian looked at me with sadness in his eyes.  "I know, but..."

I shook my head.  "No, Dorian, you and the doc.  No one else."

"Nox..."

"Dorian.  No." I didn't mean to raise my voice and Dorian pulled away completely from me sitting in his chair proper.  I turned away.  I didn't like the look on his face.  He was looking at me like I was a stubborn child.  Maybe I was being one, but I didn't like that look on his face.  His lips pursed together, like he was fighting heated words.  A heat to his eyes I'd only seen once before.  I sighed, "Fine."  I looked at him and his face was still angry with me, "If it means that much to you.  Whatever you want Dorian."

He frowned, the anger fleeing with it.  "I... Why?"

I stabbed the pasta in the styrofoam container and the fork poked four tiny holes in the packaging and was now dripping all over me.  I sighed.  "Because I can't stand that look on your face.  I never liked when you were disappointed in me as a child, and right now I don't want to make you unhappy."

Dorian offered me a napkin and took the container from me, and transfered the contents to an extra plate on the tray.  He was treating me like a child.  I sighed.

"Why would you not want to make me unhappy?"  Dorian was truly and utterly oblivious.

I sighed, "You really don't know?"  I shook my head.  "Just friends, I got it."  I tried to hide the bitterness in my voice.

"That's why you'd talk to people you don't want to.  Because you think I want that?"  He almost sounded angry at me.

I looked over at Dorian, I wanted to stand up or throw something at him.  But that would just prove to him I was just being childish.  I was such a child sometimes.  I shook my head and frowned, "No Dorian.  I would do it because you asked me to."  I whispered, "I'd do anything for you."  I turned away and poked at the plate Dorian had given me.  My appetite was gone again.

I could feel Dorian staring at me as he sat there in silence.  So I filled the silence, "But I get it Dorian.  It's not going to happen."  I turned to him and I don't know what I saw on his face - it was empty of anything I recognized.  My heart fell in my chest.  "But I'd still do whatever you asked of me.  I always will.  Call it our history, whatever you want.  But you mean more to me than anyone else who calls me family."

It was a simple question, quietly asked, "Why?"

"You saved me."

Dorian laughed, "I have done no such thing."

A tear slide down my cheek, he really didn't know, "You have done so all my life.  You rescued me from the hatred of my mother.  You were there the night I lost my best friend when I got here.  You were there the day I found out I was Cesari and the only one to actually sit down with me and explain anything about what it meant.  You encouraged me to conquer my fears.  You were there at my Ad Aetatem when I was freaking out because of the drug.  You keep away my nightmares.  Just the scent of you makes me feel safe.  And every one of those things happened when I was just a kid to you.  But every one of those moments pale in comparison to holding you when **you** needed someone.  So don't tell me you haven't saved me."  

My voice rose with the heated emotion.  I don't know if it was anger at him or at myself, "I fell fucking in love with you after sleeping on your couch.  Dorian, I don't want to be **just** friends."  I turned away from him wiping the tears away that were falling from my eyes.  I hated admitting my insecurities and every last feeling inside.  I wanted to walk out of the room but I didn't think I'd get very far.

We sat in near silence, the beeping of the monitors the only sounds.  My stomach rumbled despite feeling sick to it.  I picked up the pasta again and started eating slowly.  The sound of my fork hitting the fake china plate adding to the beeps from the machines monitoring my vitals.  I chewed slowly.  I wasn't trying to savor the taste, I was trying to keep it down.  Energy needed to be replenished.

I ate in silence.  Dorian started to fidget.  I was making him uncomofrtable.  He started to say something, he only got out "I" before he stopped himself.  I turned and gave him a weak smile.  "Don't say anything.  If you don't want to be here just go."

Dorian leaned forward in his chair and ran both of his hands through his hair.  I was glad that he was having issues with the whole situation.  It could be hope, or fuitile, but at least there was hope.  He sat there while I finished the plate of pasta and I started opening up another container.  It was the same dish I'd had with Dorian a month ago.  I smiled as I picked out a piece of chicken with my fingers and started eating it.  

Dorian looked up at me with a sad look on his face.  He needed to go, to think, I could see it written all over his face.  I nodded and Dorian stood up and moved for the door.  My heart fell.  His hand was on the door knob but I didn't want to leave it like that.  My anger was rising but I had beared my soul to him and I felt raw and empty now, but the hurt on his face made me weep inside.  I looked down at the foot of my bed, "Dorian."  He looked over his shoulder, he didn't really turn to look at me.  I looked up at him.  "I'm glad your Dad made it through this okay.  I wouldn't want you to lose them both so close together."  I saw a tear slide down his cheek as he nodded and muttered thanks and slipped out the door.

My anger unfurled itself as I flung the rolling table with all the food on it across the room.  The containers scattered and there was a mess.  I tried to curl up but it hurt too bad so I put the pillow over my head and wished I'd died.# Epilogue
_Tuesday, July 14, 2015 7:15PM_

The view from my glass office atop the Apex Unlimited building was gorgious this time of day.  The sun was behind me and I had a perfect view of the New York Skyline.  I was lost in thought of the recent merger I as contimplating but I kept being interrupted with random thoughts my 'sister' brought to my attention.  She'd been asking about old things.  Things she had no business knowing.  But things she knew about none-the-less.  All revolving around a recent accident.

A boy had jumped from the roof of the AU building and had survived.  Not really a paramount feat.  The kids have been doing it for a good 15 years or more.  Carenaning themselves over the edge using their gifts to save the day.  The irony of it all was, it was the very boy who had started the whole thing that plummeted to his near death.  

But it was the questions she asked.  "Once, I saw a book in your office - dad's office.  It was old.  It was about new races."  She'd brought the topic up more than once in the past month since the boy's fall.  He was healing miracuously - something unheard of for Venatori.  But here this boy was healing an injury he should have perished from.  Was immortality returning to the Venatori hunters like it had only gotten lost in the new genes introduced over the hundreds of centuries.  Or was this something new.  Something else?  

Whatever he was,  I needed to find out more.
