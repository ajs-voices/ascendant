I started down to the archives with a clean shirt on, it was tame again by my standards, and hopefully to those in the archives too.  My hoodie was unzipped but I could zip it if necessary.  But my walk got interrupted by a phone called.  "Hello?"  I hoped it was Dorian, though I don't know why I wanted him to call me.  I felt like a 15 year old girl but the small voice that answered had me frowning.

"Yeah Nate, I'll be right down."  My data was ready for me, he'd gotten to it sooner than I'd expected.  Instead of stopping at the Archives floor I headed down to the basement and Nate's "bat cave"

Nate was hunkered down behind his desk while a familiar frame stood in front of him.  I wasn't exactly sure if I was happy or scared to see my father.  I wasn't a praying man, but I hoped my father was in a better mood. 

The kid looked up at me and frowned as he saw me in the doorway.  Kai turned around and smiled, "Fancy meeting you here."  Had it been a ploy?

I grinned at my father in hopes to disarm him.  "I just came to get the data from my destroyed laptop."

Nate quickly handed me the jump drive he'd put the data on and cleared his throat nervously, "I just copied the documents, movies, pictures and music, nothing else."  The boy was clearly nervous.  He turned a nice shade of red as he remembered what I'd said I had on my harddrive.  I laughed to myself.

Kai turned around to see the boy blushng and the red deepened, "What's that all about?"  He asked me as he turned around.

I laughed, "I told him I had porn, girls I filmed on there."  Kai's eyes narrowed, "I swear there was nothing on there.  I told him so."

Nate started spuluttering.  I chuckled, "I'm sorry dude.  It was a joke."

Kai shook his head, "You like to step in it don't you?"

I grinned, "The more the better.  It keeps people guessing.  And I don't look foolish when others try to make me look like a fool.  I do a damned fine job of it."

Kai nodded for me to follow him out.  He turned to Nate, "Keep up the good work and thanks for tht bit of tech help.  It's greatly appreciated." 

Nate nodded and beamed with pride as his grandfather praised him.  I could see how it could make one smile.  Kai started out the door, "You were done?"

I held up my flash drive, "Just getting my harddrive."

We walked in silence for a while.  Kai interrupted it, "So... Dorian?"

I looked at him with a questioning look.  He smiled at me, "I'm not stupid.  Rumors run around here like wild fire.  And I happened to see you leaving his room this morning before stopping at the gym door."

I sighed, "Nothing happened."

Kai gave me a perplexed look.  "Why not?"  

"I don't kiss and tell Kai."  I laughed, "But since when did you become interested in my sex life?"  I didn't expect an answer it didn't really matter.

Kai answered anyway.  "Since the wife of my best friend died."

I nodded,  "Death does that.  But why do you care now?  I'm still everything you hate about me."

Kai frowned.  "Hate is a very strong word."  There was silence as we ascended the stairs.  "They don't need more problems Nox."  I  made to protest that I wasn't going to cause problems, but Kai held up his hand, "Let me finish first.  I know you don't intend to cause problems.  But they tend to follow you around.  Dorian is in a fragile state."

As if I didn't know that already.  I mean the man broke down and cried in my arms.  I think I knew exactly what state he was in.  I had to interrupt, "Kai, he's just a friend.  Nothing happened.  I'm not stupid or uncaring and I sure as hell don't want to hurt Dorian.  I **like** Dorian."  And I meant that more than I thought possible.  Somehwere between him rejecting me and this moment I had accepted the fact that I wanted to be with Dorian.  I know it was my insecurities pulling me towards the scent of safety, but I really did want to be more with Dorian -  more than anyone else I had ever been with.

Kai nodded, "And I don't want you to get hurt either."  There was sadness in Kai's voice, "But that it isn't the whole truth.  Dae'lin told me what happened to you as a child."

"Fuck!" I could feel the anger rising, Dae'lin couldn't keep her damned mouth shut.  "It doesn't matter, there is nothing you can do about it now."

Kai sighed, "There was and I did."

I stopped without thinking where I was.  I could feel the fear and the pain and everything that Garrett had ever inflicted up on me.  I could see him in my minds eye coming after me.  I could feel him beating me again.  I whispered, "What did you do?"

Kai took a few steps back down as he'd climbed a few stairs after I'd stopped.  He looked at me in my state of panic and he put his hand on my arm,  "He was exiled.  Dae'lin stopped me from doing what I intended to do."  Kai's anger was written all over his face.  "You and I may not get along Nox.  But you ARE my blood, and no one treats my blood the way Garrett treated you."

I stood paralyzed with fear.  Garrett would know I told, would know I caved.  I swallowed hard, I felt like I was five again.  Kai stared at me "You aren't alone anymore."

I shook my head and whispered, "You shouldn't have done that."  

Kai looked lost, even more lost than I felt.  I sank to the stair my feet were on and turned to sit.  I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.  Garrett...

Kai sat with me.  He asked in a quiet voice, "Do I need to call someone?"

I shook my head.  I would be fine.  I had to calm myself down.  I took a deep breath and pushed away the fear.  It was the only thing I could do.  The ache in my back persisted, the phantom strikes always lingered.  I could still see them in my head, but I ignored them.  I stood up and whispered, "You should have killed him."

I started up the stairs and when Kai caught up he grabbed my arm and out of habit I pulled it from his grasp.  I yelped, "Please don't touch me right now."

Kai raised an eyebrow, "Is it that bad kid?"

I turned to look at my father, "You have no idea how bad it gets."  I sighed, "I wish Dae'lin hadn't told you. She can't keep her damn mouth shut."

Kai shook his head, "She cares, that's all."

My voice was quiet and distant, "She only wants to do her duty.  Garrett did his job.  He did his duty."  I spat out the words, "I don't spark out of fear.  I don't spark out of anger."  I leaned in and my voice grew dark, "He beat the spark out of my flesh.  I learned control.  I am who I am because of him.  He did his duty too."  I stalked off.

Now I was pissed.  But I'd take that over afraid, anything but afraid.  I wasn't some five year old kid to be pushed around.  My father caught up to me again this time he didn't try to touch me.  "Talk to me Nox.  What can I do?"

I stopped.  "Kai. There is nothing you can do.  You can't go back in time and change things.  You can't protect me from myself.  It's something **I** have to do for myself.  Even if you could go change it, I don't want you to.  I am me because of him.  I don't hide behind the fact that he beat me Kai.  I told no one.  Am I damaged from it?  Yes.  Am I broken?  Yes.  But I **am** me.  I won't change me cause you think I deserve pity.  I like who I am.  It took years upon years of talking with Margo about it, but I'm okay with me now."  I sighed.  "You want to help?"

Kai nodded.  I took a step back, cleared the space between us, "Talk to Margo, figure out how you can fit into my mental health plan and goals.  I'll set you an appointment.  You can talk with her.  You are part of my issues despite not even having known me.  I will let you in, let you help but I don't know how Kai.  My default mode is to push you away.  To make you angry so I don't have to be hurt again."

Kai snickered, "For being someone who pushes away you are open about all of it."

I grinned, "You caught me in an off moment.  Instead of internalizing my shit you got to hear it.  This is my life, Kai.  I fight panic attacks every day.  I wake myself up with nightmares every night.  I don't sleep out of fear of my dreams.  I push people away so they don't hurt me.  These are the tip of the iceberg.  And yet no one knows half of it."

Kai frowned, "And now Dae'lin has voided your trust of her?"

I nodded, "Yes.  Just in time for the fucking breeding program negotiations."

Kai sighed, "I will see to it that your demands are met, and I will impinge a few additional on them."

"Why would you do that?"

Kai grinned, "Because I'm your father and they owe me a few favors.  Don't concern yourself with them."  Kai put his arm around me tenatively and when I didn't shrug him off he pulled me close.  "I ask only one thing of you.  I want to know my grandkids like I didn't get to know you."

I smiled, "Of course."  

Kai nodded in the direction of the doors we were about the pass, "This is me.  Nox..."  He waited until I looked at him.  "Let me know when I should go see your therapist."

I nodded, "I'll text you the details."  Kai nodded and headed onto the floor he had left me on.  I started my way up to the Archives, I would finally get some work done.
