# Caught on Fire
_Monday, June 15, 2015 10:45PM_

    "Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable." -- Bruce Lee

I got to my room and found the door wide open and my things strewn all over the place.  How lovely.  My gun was sitting out in the open left for just anyone to come in and fire.  I sighed as I put it back in the bottom of my bag.  My bathroom was trashed.  All the clean white fluffy towels were laying in a heap on the floor.  Everything was mess.

I set to folding the towels.  My OCD was kicking in.  Dae'lin's perfection grated on my nerves, but then again I'd become so accustomed to it I hardly noticed when it was my training versus my own neurocies anymore.  

A knock came at the door I'd left open.  A familiar voice called out, "Nox, you here?"

I smiled to myself, and my heart started to race.  I shouted from the bathroom.  "Yeah, come on in to the disaster area."

Dorian walked in and stood in the doorway to the bathroom and leaned against the frame.  He watched me as I finished folding the towels and put them in the linen closet.  "Seems my room was searched rather throughly."

Dorian gave me a sympathetic yet strained smile, "Mine wasn't nearly so bad.  But then again I'm certain that I was treated rather kindly due to the circumstances."

I frowned but when I looked up to see Dorian's face he was still putting on a feigned smile.  But the smile quickly faded and left small lines of worry that etched into his beautiful face.  Death among the Venatori was not uncommon, but this was a tragedy.  

I grinned at Dorian trying to lighten the mood as I leaned against the bathroom door, it gave a little under my weight and I had to shift my feet ungraceful like.  "I'm sure they were down right nice to you."

I waved Dorian into the studio proper. There was no point standing in the bathroom, where my mind was wandering to various things I'd like to be doing.  Things I rapidly pushed from my mind.  "I'm starving.  I need to go get something to eat.  If you don't mind coming with, we can talk on the way over, over dinner and find someplace to finish talking about what I see."

Dorian nodded, "I think that will work.  I know a nice little place, if you don't mind."

I laughed,  "Didn't you just come from a work dinner?"

Dorian nodded, "Yeah but the food was several hours ago.  But the wine is good and I can go for desert."

I nodded and smiled.  "If that's what you want."  

Dorian looked down and saw one of my shirts that had been tossed unceremoniously on the floor.  He picked it up and chuckled to himself as he tossed it to me. "Nice shirt."

I uncurled it from my fingers and snickered, "One of my favorites."

Dorian smirked through the sorrow.  "I'd hit that," Dorian colored slightly as he recited the words on the offensive t-shirt.  It was of course referencing a pinata, but meant so much more than that.  When Dorian saw I was watching him, his blush deepend, but it quckly changed to a frown as he walked past me.  Something was bothering him, and it wasn't the death of his mother.  I swallowed hard and tried not to show my fustration or my need.  Margo's words rang in my head, "You need to let someone in."  Dorian was in as far as anyone had ever gotten, if I opened the door more and he rejected me I'd be worse off.  Fear lanced through my body and I fought to push it back and headed towards the door, following Dorian out of my apartment.

Dorian started for the stairs and I chuckled softly, "We can take the elavator, you know."

Dorian laughed, "Habit, I suppose."

I shook my head, "You take the stairs out of habit?"

Dorian kept walking as he answered, "When I'm with you, yes."  He frowned, "I didn't like the way it envoked fear in you.  It's nothing to take the stairs when I'm in your company."  And there it was again.  I wish I knew what was bothering him about me.  But it didn't matter, there was little hope in anything if he was pulling away.  I should give up now before I make myself crazy.  I focused on the topic, not on the person.  Maybe that would help.  I did like talking about myself.

"You do realized that I broke the dread of heights when I was eight years old, at your suggestion if you recall."

Dorian nodded, "Yes, but by then I'd had it ingrained into me.  Those first years saw you in my office more times than I can count.  Dae'lin having had to adjust to you as much as you to her.  I expect the same of Levi and you."

"Well if he's got as much potential as you think he does, then I'm sure we'll butt heads a few times.  How did your dinner go?"  I asked to change the topic.

We stopped on landing.  Dorian hesitated.  "I think that is something you should be sitting for."

I laughed, "I'm not going to fall down, no matter what you say.  I think I can walk.  You can't say that and not tell me now."  I winked at Dorian.

Dorian sighed but continued the descent down the stairs, "The lovely lady who Dae'lin has hired I think you might know."

"Seriously?"  I shook my head, "Stella was here in the building this morning?"

Dorian nodded, "Yes.  She was guaranteed the job."

Now I was confused, "Why?  She didn't seem to think so."

Dorian turned a slight shade of red, it was a cute look on the tanned skinned man.  "I told her mother it was an interview, but the job was hers no matter what if she came to interview for it."

We walked down an entire flight of stairs with our foot steps being the only sound until Dorian continued, "This whole progeny thing threw me for a loop.  To see if I could bring myself to do what was necessary I left my station for a few months to find someone I could try... to... with."

I grinned, "You mean you went to Denver to find a girl to sleep with?"

Dorian nodded, "Put bluntly, yes.  I found a girl I could," Dorian's blush deepened, "with.  She was sweet and kind and young enough that my," he paused searching for a word.  I didn't interrupt I didn't realy know what he was grasping for.  He finally continued, "inexperience wouldn't be overly weird."

"Inexperience, Dorian I seriously doubt that.  With a girl maybe, but you are hardly inexperienced." 

Dorian chuckled, "And you know this, how?"

I could feel the blood rushing to my ears, "An educated guess."

We reached the main landing and started for the door of the stair well.  Dorian opened the door and put his hand on the small of my back and guided me through the door a step ahead of him.  I could feel a shiver run up my spine from his touch.  I had to swallow the sound that threatened to escape my mouth at his singular touch. My mind was reeling, I was more than confused. 

Dorian fell in step with me and continued, "Well I suppose your guess is correct, she never complained or noticed my lack of knowledge. I stayed for two months before I couldn't lie to her anymore.  She was getting serious and I couldn't love her."  Dorian sighed, "The day I told I was leaving, she'd had something to tell me.  She insisted I go first.  When I pressed her, she waved me off but her mother sent me an email bitching me out.  'How could you leave my daughter when she's pregnant with your child?'"

Fuck me!  I closed my eyes, I couldn't imagine that feeling, though I imagined it was painful.  I didn't have to ask how it happened because Dorian answered my unspoken question, "She'd been sick, the condom broke, antibotic and that screwed us pretty good.  We thought things were okay.  But apparently not.    I'd told her mother I didn't love her daughter, but I would help however necessary, through her.  She agreed.  Stella lost her job about a week ago. When she told me, I arranged for Dae'lin to hire her."

"Dae'lin's assistant's time was ending anyway, and with Stella, Dae'lin won't need to replace her for a while.  The meeting last night was informing Stella that her son was different."

I nodded, "And that you were different.  And she was about to become venatori."

Dorian nodded, "Yes.  Her son is likely Magnus.  100% of minorem born to a human mother that both mother and child have surived have been Magnus."

"I know the statistic."

Dorian nodded, "I firgured you would.  You did quite a bit of research on your past if I recall."

"Only on that, not curious enough to find out who my father was."  I gave a hesitant laugh, I really hadn't cared back then to find out who my father was.

Dorian nodded, "Yes, there is that.  If I'd known you'd met Stella, I wouldn't have made the suggestion for yesterday."

I frowned, "Why not?  You expected me to sleep with her?"

Dorian's sharp laugh made me jump. "Actually yes.  I didn't expect the child to inhibit your natural inclination."

I smiled, "Seems I still have a few surprises left."

"You do at that."  Dorian lead the way through the large double doors of the building and headed for the subway platform around the corner.  We didn't chat much while we caught the D train heading towards Little Italy.  Despite the hour it was relatively full, it seemed everyone piled into this one car.  There was standing room only.  Which wasn't a bother really.

Dorian chose a spot near the rear of the car and used the strap to keep his balance. The car lurched to a start and I had no choice but to grab the same one.  The motion of the car pressed Dorian's hip into the front of me.  We were close enough to whisper.  I could smell his crisp clean scent of cinnamon and vanilla - a perfect safe zone.  I could feel Dorian's breath on my cheek before he whispered, "I didn't plan this honest."

I chuckled, "I wouldn't have minded if you had."  I really wouldn't have, I could feel his body heat through my hoodie and jeans and I wanted to touch the man next to me.  I really needed to get this crap out of my system somehow.  Dorian looked down and the rest of the way was an uncomfortable silence.

15 minutes later I was nearly breathless from his touch.  I wanted to touch him more but Dorian hurried through the turn stiles and headed up the stairs to the street.  I followed but not nearly as closely as I had earlier.

The air outside felt crisp and cool compared the to stuffy heated air of the underground subway system.  Dorian headed towards Mulberry Street.  I caught up with him but my heart wasn't in the game anymore.  Dorian wasn't interested.  He was too conflicted by something.

We rounded the corner and there were any number of food joints on Mulberry Street, it was after all Little Italy, for which I was actually grateful for. I'd missed good Italian food when I was out west.  I could get great Mexican food, but Italian, not so much.

We past several little places that would have suited my tastes just fine, but when we stopped in front of the darkened would-be maroon awning of Pellegrino's I was surprised.  Dorian had fine tastes, but it was a bit too fine for my pay check.  But I didn't object when Dorian opened the door for me, I should have said something.  I felt Dorian's hand slide along the small of my back as I walked in through the door in front of him.  Such a small gesture and I was melting again at his touch.  I was a mess, Dorian was going to drive me crazy and there was nothing I could do to make it go away.  Every little thing he did I was turning upside down and twisting it to fit my insecurities or my longing.  Why the fuck couldn't I straighten myself out?

The hostest greet Dorian with surprise, "Didn't you just leave?"

Dorian nodded, "My friend is hungry, I figured I could use another bottle of wine and keep him company."

She smiled, "Right this way Mr. Vega."

The woman lead us to a table, they were almost at capacity even this late at night.  It was a wonder that the city that never sleeps really was like this even this late at night.  I would have to readjust my expectations of life again if I intended to stay here.

We sat down and the woman left menus with us.  Dorian picked up the wine menu, "You have any preferences?"

I laughed, "I'll trust your judgement, I'm more a beer kinda guy."

Dorian gave me a weak smile, "We can go elsewhere."  He was asking now?  He didn't ask when we walked in here, and I really couldn't complain though I should.  

I shook my head,  "Here is fine.  I missed good Italian food."  I opened the menu and started browsing and I tried not to react the prices on the menu.  But I knew I'd be working this meal off in many ways.   It wasn't uncommon to spend more than I'd like on a date, but this wasn't exactly a date either.

Our waitor came to the table, "I am Miguel, I will be your server today.  Can I start you off with anything?"

Dorian spoke calmly, "We'll have a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  I'll poke at his plate while I wait for desert."  He smiled at me and I couldn't help but laugh.

"You think I'm sharing?" I grinned playfully at Dorian.

Miguel smiled and looked to me expectantly, "Are you ready to order?"

I smiled up at him with my best smile, "Yeah, I'll start off with Mozzarella Della Casa."

"And your meal?" He asked with a slight frown.  Not one to flirt with, I dialed back.

"Pollo Pastore."  I ordered with a little less flair which earned me a smile from Miguel and from Dorian.

Dorian nodded approvingly at my choices when Miguel left Dorian smiled, "Couldn't have done better myself."

I beamed, "Ain't my first rodeo.  Though I do hope they bring something quickly, I'm starving."

Dorian asked, "You forget to eat today?"

"Something like that.  Just busy I didn't think about it." I hadn't thought about it until my stomach rumbled in the presense of Dorian's father, I sighed, "Your father.  He's a power horse.  I don't think I could have picked up directly after...  Not like he did."

There was sadness in Dorian's eyes as he spoke, "He will power through it until it's over and then he'll crash.  I think we all will.  None of us have felt the pain yet, I know I haven't."  Dorian paused and put a litle thought into his words, "How did you manage, when you lost your mother?" It was almost like he didn't know how to ask the question, or was afriad of the answer.

I shrugged, "I wasn't close to my mother.  I got through it with relatively little pain.  I only have guilt for the circumstances really.  If I'd done my job properly, if I'd not let her superior old school philosphy overrule my judgement she'd still be alive.  If Jace were to go, or Dae'lin or even you, that would be something else entirely.  My family is not one of blood."

"I'm family?"  He sounded shocked.

I laughed, "Closest I've come to it anyway."

Dorian sighed, "That doesn't bode well for this..."  He waved his hand over the table, "Whatever this is."

It was my turn to frown.  "This?  If you don't know what this is, and I'm clueless to it as well.  I don't know if we'll ever find out."

Dorian looked at me with pain in his eyes.  There I went shooting off my mouth again.  I looked down at the table and shook my head.  "I'm sorry."

Dorian's hand touched mine and I looked up to see the comforting face I remembered as a child.  "It's not your fault."  

I pulled my hand away.  "You have to stop that, Dorian."

"Stop what?"  It was such an innocent question, and he really didn't seem to understand.

"Stop touching me that way.  Like there could be more."  I wanted to stand up and go but my stomach rumbled and I knew I had to eat.

Dorian frowned, "Nox..."  He hesitated, he wanted to say more, he kept working his mouth trying to form the words.  

But Miguel arrived with a basket of freshly baked bread and I could see the steam rolling off the top and the patterns above the bread, it was all sort of harmonious.  My mouth started to water.  I looked up at Miguel, "You are a god."  I took a peice of bread from the basket before Miguel set it down on the table.  I took a bite and it melted in my mouth.  I was so hungry.

Dorian sighed,  "Don't mind my friend here, he's been starving himself all day just to fit into those lovely jeans of his."

I tried to laugh, instead I choked on the bread I had just bitten into.  The waitor left in a hurry as if he'd gotten more than he bargained for at our table. He probably had. 

Dorian looked down at his hands on the table and fidgetted with his napkin.  I could see the wheels turning while he tried to find the words he'd been searching for but I change the topic, "Do you see the patterns around the bread?"  Something we actually came here to do.

Dorian adjusted in his chair, the interest in the topic peaking his curiousity in a way that my flirting hadn't. I smiled at the fact but I knew it was just a ploy to hide my fustration.  Dorian strained, I could tell he was focusing intently on the cooling bread, he finally nodded, "Yeah, they look like they are dissipating though."

I nodded, "They are cooling down.  That's how it looks around people, except it oscillates, Kai who bends fire and earth, he'll oscillate pretty steadily between attracking fire and earth.  Indicating he actually is as strong in both."

I paused to think about the patterns I'd seen today.  I had noticed alot of changes, the most notable was in Jason, "Jason.  He's changed a little since I was here last.  He is strong in Air and earth, but he's got a little fire and a small oscilation of water now too."

Dorian nodded, "You should sit in his class one day and listen to him speak.  I won't do his theory justice, but it's pretty simple.  If you can train your eye to see the patterns, you can manipulate them all to some degree or another.  You inspired him."

I smiled, "So that means you can manipulate all the elements?"

Dorian shrugged, "Can't teach an old dogs new tricks."

I laughed, "I bet I could teach you a few new tricks."  The innuendo was not lost on either of us, Dorian shifted uncomfortably and the thought made my body stir and my heart flutter faster. _Fuck!_  I was going to have to watch my words now too. "You've seen them far longer than anyone else and say you can only just touch Air.  I think you are your own interferrance."

"Perhaps, but I will stick to my guns."  He looked like he was about to crawl out of skin with discomfort.

I nodded and let it all go.  There was no other option.

Miguel brought out the anti-pasto I had ordered.  He set the plate down in the middle of the table and placed a plate in front of each of us.  Dorian nodded to him in thanks.  The fresh, smoked, buffalo mozzarella, tomato, roasted peppers and basil looked to die for, almost too pretty to eat.  I didn't waste much time taking a bit of the dish to my plate.

A second waitor came bearing gifts. The wine was presented to Dorian and he nodded.  The server poured two glasses and Dorian took small sip and savored it.  I watched Dorian test the wine to his satisfaction.  The man left the bottle sitting on the table.  I took a sip of the wine. I'd never been a fan of wine, but it was fruity.  I couldn't say much more about the wine. 

My stomach took that moment to growl, I didn't wait any longer.  "I'm starving."  I popped a bit into my mouth.  The first bite was exuqisite and I was drooling.  I could have done my Homer impression but not in polite company.  God I was hungry.  

Dorian nibbled at small portion of the anti-pasto he'd taken.  He watched me finish the plate and the basket of fresh bread.  Dorian shook his head in disblief as I was chewing the last bit of crust and looking around for more food with a frown.  "You'd think they starved you for months."

I laughed, "I ... Well that's kinda true.  I have to remember to eat.  I tend to do this a lot."

Dorian shook his head, "We'll have to fix that while you stay here."

I raised an eyebrow, "Oh?"  My heart fluttered and my body reacted to the thought of Dorian fixing things.  I pushed away the feelings and all the mixed signals just as the waitor showed up bearing my dinner.

Miguel brought out the plate of chicken, it looked decedant.  My mouth started to water again as the man placed the new plate in front of me.   He deftly took the other plates away and asked, "More bread?"

I grinned up at our waitor, "Yes, please."

Dorian poured another glass of wine for himself.  I realized I had hardly touched mine, but then again I had an empty stomach too.  I took a small sip and smiled before I broke into he chicken on my plate.  

Dorian nibbled ever so patiently on a peice of bread as he stared at the cooling bread.  I grinned, "Try to warm it."

Dorian looked up from his concentration, "What?  Sorry I..."

I smiled, I didn't really want to know what he'd been thinking about. "Try to warm it.  The pattern is already there, strengthen it.  I know you know what I mean, you teach kids to do it every day."

Dorian sighed, "You won't let it be, will you?"

I chuckled softly as I finished my mouh full, "Fat chance.  Just once.  Please?"  I was not above begging.

Dorian sighed giving in to my request.  "I suppose."

I watched Dorian with pleasure and curiousity.  I wished I could see from his perspective, relive that moment of dawning when you find that key to the pattern.  Sweat started to form on Dorian's brow but I saw the pattern strengthen and solidify and Dorian dropped the bread to his plate as it became too warm to touch.

Dorian frowned but he looked up with a half smile, "I suppose you are right."

I beamed at Dorian and patted Dorian's hand that was resting on the table.  "I knew you could do it."  I hadn't meant to do it.  It had been a reflex.

Dorian looked down at my hand on top of his and whispered, "I can't get over the fact that I met you when you were five."

He looked up at me with what I could only describe as fear in his eyes.  I scared him.  I knew that image was everything to Dorian.  And to him I'd always be five.  I nodded as I pulled my hand away from his. I understood the problem now.  And there was nothing I could do about it.

I cut the chicken in silence and stabbed a peice.  My fork clanked against the plate. Dorian asked, "So that's it?"  I looked up at him I couldn't answer a question I didn't know fully what it was.  He sighed, "You give up with a little bit of resistance?"

I shook my head and finished chewing.  "There is nothing **I** can do about your issue.  There will always be 14 years between us.  There will always be our shared history.  To you, I'll always be that little kid who you watched grow up."  I shook my head, "Sometimes I wonder if I hadn't been Cesari if you'd have even bothered looking after me."

Dorian sighed, "That's not fair.  I already told you I cared.  I care about everyone under my charge."

I nodded, "That's right.  You do.  So why me?  Why give a damn about me?."  I answered my own question. "Because I'm Cesari.  I'm your little niche.  I'm your gateway to fame."  I could feel my blood pressure rising, the anger that wanted to spew forth.

I could see that Dorian wanted to say something.  He stammered but he clamped his mouth shut and took a deep breath.  It was the only time I'd ever seen Dorian lose his cool.  He blinked at me and then took a sip of his wine.  "I will ignore that.  You open a door and when someone steps in you push them away.  I should have seen it earlier."

He knew me too well.  Dorian knew my every fatal flaw. He'd been watching me my entire life, going through my sessions with Margo, detailing my life in his records.  I dropped my head to my hands in despair.  He was right but I wasn't going to tell him that.  I pushed my plate forward, I'd lost my appetite again.  I felt like I was going to get sick.

I don't know how long we sat in silence before Dorian reached out across the table and I felt his fingers gently brush my elbow.  I looked up at him with fire in my eyes.  But Dorian didn't flinch at my anger.  He looked at me with pained eyes.  It made me feel bad for my out burst.  I saw the sadness creasing his forehead, the strain of keeping that perfect image up.  I saw raw need, but I didn't know what he needed.  I dropped my hands to the table, "What do you need, Dorian?"  It was the barest of whispers, I hadn't intended to say it out loud, but there it was.

He cocked his head to the side.  I would give anything to know what he was thinking.  "Right now, I need a friend.  Tomorrow who knows."  He pushed my plate back in front of me, "**You** need to eat."

I nodded with a sigh. And picked up my fork.  I finished eating what should have been a delightful meal.  We changed the topic and spoke about the patterns, and the difference in the way things worked.  We discussed what Jason was doing with the younger generation.  We talked about anything but us.

We sat for several minutes in each other's company after my plate was finished before Miguel came back and cleared things, "Will there be anything else?"

I looked to Dorian he'd said he wanted desert now was the time. "The fruit tart." 

The waitor looked to me and I nodded, "The same, and coffee please."

When Miguel left Dorian raised an eyebrow, "Am I that much of a lush?"

I laughed, "No, I just like coffee with my desert."

"Where as I'm having another glass of wine with mine."  After a moment of thought Dorian added, "What will we do afterwards?  I don't really want to go home yet."

I smiled, "What would you like to do, Dorian?  I'm sure I can find something that could satisfy your desires."  I frowned at the implications again, but Dorian gave me a reassuring smile.

"Surprise me." Dorian's bright blue eyes twinkling in the dim light of the restuaruant.

I grinned, "That could end very badly, my friend.  Be thankful my tastes are not quite as esoteric as Jason's.  Or you might find yourself in the middle of an orgie."

Dorian choked on his wine as he fought back laughter and slight embarrassment if the color of his face was any indication.  Dorian regained his composure and was able to speak, "Jason's got... interesting tastes." Dorian's comment made me wonder what he knew of Jason's tastes. "I assume you went along willingly?"

"Of course.  What's an outcast to do if he's offered fun and games with a friend where noone knows him."

Dorian asked in all seriousness. "Do you miss it?"

I shrugged, "I missed Jace, I don't miss running around making childish mistakes.  Even if those mistakes were pretty damn exciting."

"He's grown up, since you left.  He didn't have anyone to drag around, and then Mia snagged her fingers into him and he calmed down even more."

"Jason, had been willing years before to calm down for Mia.  Mia wasn't ready.  Their on again off again relationship wore them both down."

"Leaving you behind."  The concern was back in Dorian's voice.  Always looking out for me.  I tried not to think about it and let my thoughts go, but it wasn't easy.

"Nah.  I left.  It's all good."  I didn't blame Jace for moving on.  I would have too if I'd had someplace to go.

The tarts and my coffee arrived.  It looked decedant.  I enjoyed the sweet and tart with the bitterness of the coffee.  I couldn't have asked for a better meal.  Somehow over the course of our desert the conversation turned towards the breeding program.  

Dorian sighed, "The Dowager I've been asked by has decided it must be soon, this cycle she says.  I don't suppose I can put it off any longer."

To be forced into a sexual relationship was not something I would wish upon anyone.  A memory tugged at my mind and I pushed away the fear and the pain that started to rise.  I gave Dorian a look of sympathy, "If I could help you I would."

"Perhaps in time you could have."  Dorian added without thought.  Maybe it wasn't what he intended to say or not say it at all.  I wanted to hope for more, but right now Dorian needed a friend.  I could do that - for now.  Thankfully, Miguel choose that time to place a black folio with our bill in it on the table.  He didn't even bother to say anything as he scurried away leaving us alone again. 

I could have made a big deal about the possiblities, but I let it go.  I took the folio from the table but Dorian carefully pulled it from my hands before I had a chance to look at the bill.  He stood up and I couldn't help but look up at him slowly - taking him in.  It wasn't so much different than when I first saw him again except this time he was wearing a crisp button up shirt with long sleeves perfectly cuffed to his elbows.  The edge of his tattoo displayed down his right arm.  I hadn't reached his face before I saw money drop to the table on top of the bill.  He hadn't even looked at it.  There was way more cash there than my meal or the wine should have cost.  

I looked up at him and he was watching me.  "It's worth it."  I wanted to ask it was worth what, we hadn't done anything.  He'd barely eaten so it wasn't the food he was talking about.  I looked away taking the last swallow of my coffee before standing up.  I walked towards the door knowing Dorian was following me.  I could feel his eyes on me though I was confident that it was not the same feelings coursing through him that were running rampent through me.
