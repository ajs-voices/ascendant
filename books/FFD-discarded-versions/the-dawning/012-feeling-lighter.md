# Feeling Lighter
_Monday, June 15, 2015 8:15AM_

We walked slowly, Jace was stalling.  I stopped before a stair well and asked, "What's wrong?"

Jace shook his head, "Nothing.  I don't get why you let him walk all over you at the start.  Do you know how many people would cheer if you gave him a beat down?  You could you know, beat him."

I grinned, "To prove what?  That I'm bigger and badder than he is?  I could care less about him.  He's a boy in a man's world.  He's sitting here being big man on campus.  I've hunted vampires and dragons.  And as long as I don't start the fight, Jace, no one can say I'm being the bully when I show him just what I'm capable of."

Jace nodded, "You should still kick the shit out of him."  Jace turned to the stair well and put his hand on the push bar, "He's gotten worse since we were kids."

"I had noticed that.  And the boys that follow him are even stupider than they were back then."

He gave a small laugh, "I got a class to teach.  If you find some free time today stop by.  Show the kids what you are all about.  They've heard so much from me, I'd love for you to jump for them so that I can show them exactly what inspired me, so you can inspire them too."

I nodded, "Sure.  I'll try to make it up there."

Jace wrapped his arm around my neck and gave me a quick hug and whispered in my ear, "I missed you bro.  Stay around."

I smiled and patted his back, "I'll try to do that too."

Jace opened the door to the stair well and left me alone.  I had a few minutes before I needed to be in Margo's office.  I decided now would be a good time to drop my laptop off in the dungeon's that the IT department called home.  I took the stairs up and headed towards my room.

In my room I sighed, we'd left the coffee pot on and now my room smelled like burnt coffee.   I dumped the pot and turned the machine off.  I'd have to go buy some air freshener or something.  Nothing I could conjur up would actually remove smell only aggitate the dust and the windows were sealed shut.  

I grabbed my laptop and took the elevator down stairs to the basement.  It wasn't really a dungeon, but as a kid it had felt like one when we spent a stint working there.  It was annoying, and it smelled musty and was dark and damp.  I didn't like it.

I found the repair room and rolled my eyes at the sign on the door, it said "Bat Cave".  I knocked on the open door and stepped inside.  A kid with chocolate brown hair sat fiddling with a screw driver and small screw in some peice of equipment.  When I knocked he jumped.  I appologized, "Sorry man."

He looked up at me, his name plate on his desk said "Nate Monroe".

I held up my laptop and he frowned, "You don't expect me to fix that do you."

I laughed, "No.  But I was hoping that you could retreive the data on it so I didn't lose all my files."

He frowned.  "I don't really have time."

"Alright, tell me what I need to do to do it myself and I'll take care of it.  I don't have anything important for the case I'm working but I'd like to have my music back."

Nate looked at me with disdain, "I'm sure your porn is easily replacable."

I had to laugh, it felt good to let that out.  I surprised myself with the length of my laughter.  I quipped, "I dunno, some them girls I filmed are pretty damn hot, I'd hate to lose that footage."

His eyes went wide and his mouth dropped.  I grinned at his reaction, "I could really use your help when you have time.  It's not important."

Nate nodded, "You are him.  Aren't you?"

"Him who?"

"Kai Viddens' half human son.  I recognize you from a picture he has sitting on his desk. You are here helping grandfather find the man who hurt Uncle Nicholas aren't you?"

I nodded but was slightly taken aback, "Grandfather??  You must be Iris' son?"

Nate nodded, "Yeah, one of them anyway.  I'll help you out if you promise me to find that bastard."  He turned red he probably would have been yelled at by Kai or Iris.  Such a strict way to live, I wouldn't have liked it.

"I'll do my best." I assured him.

Nate nodded, "That's all I can ask."  

I handed Nate my card, "You can call me here with the results.  A flash drive or in the cloud someplace I can grab it would be awesome."

Nate nodded as he took the card I offered him.  He glanced at my name, "Alright Uncle Nox.  I'll do that.  I need to get back to work."

I nodded with a salute and headed out the door. I had just enough time to be early for my appointment with Margo.  

Margo's office was in the Infirmary.  Not where they actually had medical emergencies or check ups but there were offices.  I walked into the waiting room, it smelled like apples.  It always smelled like apples.  The woman at the front desk looked up as I walked in and a great big smile grew on her lips.  "Megan.  A pleasure.  It's been a while."

She tapped the intercom with a grin, "Dr. Silverman your 9:30 is here."  Megan tossed her raven locks over her shoulder and smiled at me again, "Take a seat Nox, she'll be right with you."

I nodded and sat down in the posh chairs, the decor of the room matched that of the scent used.  It felt like a up scale apple orchard farm house.  There was a bowl of plastic apples on the coffee table, there was even a live tree in the corner.  It wasn't a real apple tree, but there were little plastic apples hanging from it.

It was meant to be relaxing.  There was forest sounds playing softly in the speakers around the room.  I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes and relaxed into the serenity of the atmosphere.  I heard the office door open and a pair of high heels tapping their way in my direction.  There was a pause and then she continued towards me and sat down next to me.  I could smell the soft hint of apples in Margo's perfume and smiled, "Good morning, Margo.  I truly missed this."

I could hear the smile in her voice, "We can sit here for a moment if you like."

I nodded and didn't open my eyes.  "Aaron started a fight with me in the cafeteria."

"Right to the point.  As always.  How did that make you feel?"

I sat up and opened my eyes and turned towards the woman who had been asking me that question for well over 17 years.  I grinned at her, "As it always does.  I didn't like it.  I fought the panic that wanted to creep in.  He got in one lucky punch to the stomach.  I could have lost it then."

Margo nodded, "What did you do?"

"I fought the feeling, and I blocked his other blows, he didn't like that he started bending fire.  I smothered it and him until I said my peice then walked away."

She smiled, "That's good.  Ready to go in and sit and talk more privately."

I nodded and stood up.  I offered Margo my arm and she laughed, "Ever the charmer.  We did miss you."

I winked at her and then at Megan as I walked passed her.  "Ever the flirt too."

I grinned, "Of course, I must be me."

Margo shook her head, "You must be the person you created at every possible turn.  You know that's not you."

And there it was, the shirnking started.  I sat down in the chair and sighed, "Yeah but if I'm the real me outside of this room or my own private thoughts I'd be depressed, or worse dead."

Margo nodded, "I'm glad you understand that.  But you have to let someone in, or you going to be even more lonely now that Jason has a life outside of you."

I laughed, "I've spent three years away from him.  I know that already.  I've not had a single relationship that lasted more than a few weeks since I left here.  I can't find it in myself to trust anyone that much."

"You push people away, Nox.  You always have.  Jason gave you something without you asking, he told you he was like you.  He opened up to you with his choices and you cling to it.  You have to let someone else do that for you."

I sighed and leaned back against the leather couch, "I know.  I try and then I can't.  They do something that sets me off.  They trap me, and it doesn't have to be physical anymore, an emotional entrapment sets me off too."

"So tell me why you booked this appointment before you even got here?"

I grinned, "I knew something would happen the moment I get in the door.  I've had Dae'lin assualt me with her desire to procreate.  I met a girl on the plane over and she wants me to be _that_ gay friend.  My father doesn't want me here, he threw me up against a wall.  Jace broke my laptop.  And then there's this knew attraction to someone I've known my entire life."

She smiled.  "And who might this someone be?"

I frowned and looked down.  "Dorian Vega."

Margo stopped the lift of her water glass to her lips as I said his name, she smiled like she had some kind of hidden answer in what I'd said.  "And this bothers you more than everything else."

"Yes and no.  I'm surprised I never noticed how hot he was before."  I could feel my body stir at the thought of his blue eyes, his gorgeous smile and the way his pants fit him.  I had to redirect my thoughts.  "He's always been there.  I don't think I have a chance in the world.  I can't imagine why he'd even consider a punk like me."

Margo nodded, "That's not the whole of it, is it?"

I sighed and closed my eyes.  "He knows more about me than anyone else in the world.  He's studied me, I'm nothing more than his claim to fame.  And yet he says he cares.  He said I had to tell you something I told him.  He said it would explain a lot.  And he's probably right."

"You don't want to tell me?"

"I've kept it from you since the day we met."  I sat forward and opened my eyes, I could feel the tears welling up hot in my eyes.  "Garrett beat me as a child.  He veiled the cameras and he used air and earth to make me spark."

Margo just nodded, "I suspected as much, and worse."  I shuddered, it was reflex.  "That triggered something?"

I shook my head, "Nothing conscious.  My body just reacted.  I dream about it every night.  I see his face, sometimes it's morphed into demons or dragons or various monsters.  But I know it's always Garrett.  He hits me and I wake in fear - every night."

"Your night terrors.  I always wondered why you never went into details about them.  Why didn't you tell me?"

"I was afraid.  I was always afraid.  I'm still afraid he'll torment me if he knows I told someone.  But if he touches me I'll kill him."  I sighed, "This time I won't cave to my emotions."

Margo nodded, "Let's hope it never comes to that.  Is there anything else?  Our time is almost up."

I shook my head.  "I'll be good.  I have a case to work, my best friend back in the area and I've a guy to keep my mind occupied hopefully."

Margo smiled, "I look forward to our next meeting."  She winked at me.  "I've not had any good stories in a while."

I stuck my tongue out at her and smiled.  "Thanks.  I'll see you next week."  I stood up and walked to the door.  "I'll figure out Dorian someday, don't think it'll be by next week."  I opened the door and stopped at Megan's desk.

She looked up at me, "Same time next week?"

I nodded with a wink, "Yes ma'am."

She smiled, "I'll schedule you in.  See you next week Nox."

I waved at Megan and Margo as I walked out the door.  I didn't feel better, but I felt lighter.  I always felt lighter after I talked with Margo.
