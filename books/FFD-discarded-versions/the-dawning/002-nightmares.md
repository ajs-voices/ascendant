# Nightmares
_Saturday, June 13, 2015 9:00 PM_

Camp was not too far from the little podunk town but far enough none of the locals bothered me and the lights didn't interfere with the starry sky.

I lay in my sleeping bag staring at the night sky through the tree branches wondering what I was going to do about my little dragon problem.  I wasn't going to sleep anytime soon anyway; might as well think about it.

But as I stared up, my eyes drifted close and sleep soon came.  And with sleep came the nightmares.

It always started the same.  The orange door opening slowly to reveal the darkness inside.  A pair of glowing red eyes, tentacles of air and earth pulling me inside and thrusting me against a wall.  My shirt ripped from my body just before the tentacles lash my back and I feel the tearing of my skin.  Followed by the creepy crawly feeling of my skin knitting back together.

The smell of tobacco and patchouli oil permeated the air as a voice spoke in the darkness, "You are an abomination."  The voice grated with hatred that sounded a lot like what I remembered of my mother.  More strikes followed.  The voice has changed to something much more masculine and something far darker.  "I will control you."  Fear lanced through my sleeping body.

I started awake like I always do just before the face comes into view.  My heart was pounding.  Sweat drenched my skin and hair. Phantom pain danced along my back as if old wounds had been broken open.  I lay in my bag trying to catch my breath and slow my breathing at the same time.  

The panic attack doesn't subside as quickly as I'd have liked.  I look for five things I can see in the dim moonlight – the ring of rocks around my fire, the stars in the sky, the leaves of the tree above me, my gear bag, and the moon lighting my vision.  

My breathing slows a little as I look for four things I could touch.  I reached out reflexively to the ground and grabbed a handful of dirt and leaves; two with one go.  My sleeping bag , and the hair on my head as I run my long fingers through it and get caught on a knot from all my tossing and turning.  It reminds me I need to cut my hair.

I could feel my heart rate slowing.  I continued the exercise I had been doing since I was six years old.  Three things I could hear – the crickets in the night air, a wolf howling in the distance.  I had to strain, but I could hear the quiet babble of the nearby creek.  The water was soothing and I could feel my breathing slow.

I took a deep breath and searched for two distinct smells; there were always so many.  The scent of pine was everywhere.  The forest smells were almost the smell of being safe – almost.  Underneath I could smell the decay of dead leaves on the ground.  

Finding one taste was always the hardest to get but I could feel my body slowly returning to its natural state.  My heart was not racing anymore; my breathing was shallow as I focused on it in meditation.  I knew that there was coffee in my bag and I could almost taste it. 

My phone lay next to me and I picked it up and glanced at the time.  It was close enough to dawn to rise early.  

The night was still cold as I pulled myself out of my sleeping bag.  The fire had long since gone out.

I reached for the patterns of fire I had memorized as a child and created fire from nothing.  

The fire burst into a small flame that took the chill off the night air.  The orange flickering light made the shadows dance around me.  The smell of the campfire soon overrode every other smell around me. 

I could get lost in the comforts of the forest.  This was the only time I didn't miss the city.  I prepared a pot of coffee in the percolator and set it on the fire to brew while I did my morning routine. 

My routine was part of my coping mechanisms.  I had **a lot** of coping mechanisms.  The morning strength training and yoga helped establish my mood.  Without them and coffee, I grew anxious.  My schedule had always been my lifeline – in the field it was hard to keep one, but I managed.

The coffee started to smell wonderful on the night air.  

It invigorated me without a sip.  The smell was intoxicating.  But I didn't rush through my routine, it was slow and each movement was done with precision.  Perfection was demanded.  Dae'lin, my mentor, had demanded it of me as a child, and I now demanded the same of myself.

The smell of coffee soon turned bitter as the fire overcooked it and it started to evaporate in the percolator.  It was ruined.

I finished my workout with disappointment.  After cooldown, I lifted the pot out of the fire with a pattern of air and poured the burnt coffee into my tin cup.  It would have to do; I didn't feel like brewing another pot.

I had a decision to make – rather a plan to figure out.  Last night had been a bust.

The map I pulled out was littered with all sorts of notes.  It was a local hunter’s guide map to the supernatural.  There were houses marked as haunted, were bear caves.  But nothing ever said Dragon's lair. 

I had scanned the map several times already, but one more time wasn't going to hurt as I sipped the burnt coffee and poked at the last of the roasted rabbit from yesterday.  I'd actually have to hunt again soon or I'd be stuck with canned beans and I'd rather not.

The world was full of myths and legends based on reality.  Reality was a lot less dramatic than it seemed in the movies. Supernatural creatures care a great deal about the humans they intermingle.  Most were formerly human.
I leaned back against a log that I was using as a makeshift table, chair, whatever furniture I needed at that moment and stared up at the lightening sky.  Dawn had been closer than I thought.

My thoughts drifted through myths about dragons. Dragons were magical creatures.  If only the fairy tells did them the justice they deserved.  Naomi had been beautiful – dangerous but beautiful.

In King Arthur, maidens were staked in front of caves for dragon sacrifices.  And in other stories dragons used caves to stash their hoard.  If I recalled correctly in Pete's Dragon - a Disney flick I had been obsessed with as a child, the dragon lived in a cave.  Caves seemed to be a running theme.  It was at least a good place to start.

The thought of the childhood movie brought back fond memories.  My nanny had been a dragon.  The day I had sparked she'd been sick.  I made a mess.  My mother got angry.  The fear pierced my calm and I pushed it away.  I didn't need to think about that.

I pulled the map close and started scanning the topography.  Reading maps had finally come in handy – another stupid class that finally is paying off.  It had been a while but I looked at the map and I searched for the best possible place a dragon could hide her hoard.
