# Tripping the Trap
_Tuesday, June 16, 2015 3:15PM_

The cooridor was empty, except for Emilio lying against the wall holding his hands to his side.  The sight was too familiar and I wanted to wretch.  Was this how it looked when someone found Kai?  I wondered at that moment how my father was doing?  How as Dorian?  My mind started to wander and I needed to focus on the issue at hand.  I was half way to Emilio when the elevator dinged again and the medics were there.

Emilio had caught sight of me but his head had sagged to the ground and I knew that things were looking bad.  I couldn't see the wound.  There was too much blood.  He grabbed my hand and pressed it to my body.  He understood even though I'd not said anything.  His gift was reading people.  I guess it came in handy even when you were down and out.  

I couldn't see through the spurting blood.  I didn't really try much but I gave the wound what power I could.  I could feel it sucking my resources away just as easy as it had with Dorian.  The medics arrived and pulled me from Emilio.  I let them direct me away, but my power still flowed to the wound.  I wished I could see it working.  The patterns were writhing under the strain.  I wanted to see but there were people in the way.

The same medic that had been there with Dorian was tending to his father.  She looked over at me.  "That's twice you've been here.  Who are you?"

I grinned at her.  "Does it matter?"

She stood up, "As a matter of fact it does."  She strode towards me with purpose and looked up me with a stern look.  "I won't ask again.  Who are you?"

I sighed.  "My name is Nox SÃ©tanta."

The female medic frowned just as a noise caught my attention down the hall.  The far door had closed.  I smiled at the woman.  "Sorry.  Gotta go."

I left her at a run.  I heard her yelling after me, but she wasn't chasing me.  She'd have caught me if she tried.  I wasn't going to be able to do this alone.  But I found a trail of blood on the rail leading up the stairs.  At least he was being stupid - or laying that trap I was fairly sure was the reason they'd hurt my father and Dorian.  Dorian had called me.  They wanted me to find him.  Not just anyone - me.

I slowed to a walk and had several patterns ready to use the moment they were needed.  It was draining doing so much at one time, with two draining energy sinks already done.  I was weakening.  I patted my pocket to make sure my zippo was where it was supposed to be and I was happy to find that it was.  I was going to need it I was almost certain of it.

I had to think this through now.  I was alone, with another Cesari and I didn't know how much Levi knew and what he had been pretending about.  He was adept at making things happened, it didn't matter if it was the right way or not.  I kept my eyes out for signs.  I knew he was leaving them.  A few blood stains on the railing.  A smear on the wall here and there.  He wanted me to follow him.

I wrapped myself in a wall of air.  It was easy enough to maintain.  But it was going to become cumbersome to deal with as I grew tired.  The less I could expend the better I would be, but I really didn't feel like getting stabbed or shot at.  I wished for my gun at that moment, the comforting steal in my hand would be nice.

There was a smear of blood on the doorknob and I knew I was on the floor they wanted me to be, but then again there wasn't much more up to go - just the penthouse remained and you could only reach that by the elevator.  I was wondering how these people were getting around security measure.  Maybe it wasn't a helpful lookout watching me.  Fuck!  There was another potential threat now.  I was walking deeper and deeper into shit.

I walked through the door with caution.  I wasn't exactly sure what to expect once I got into the hall way.  There was nothing out of the ordinary.  There was of course a smear of blood leading me into the trap.  I wished for a way to hide my patterns, just another thing on my wish list of things.

A let my senses go, they had saved me a great number of times and I was going to need them.   I walked slowly, letting my other senses take over more than my eye sight.  I waited for a sound or a scent to drift my direction to indicate danger.  Sometimes you could smell fear, but I got nothing.  Past a few doors there was another smear of blood.  I could feel the anxiety rising but I knew this was a trap. I just wasn't sure I wanted to trip it alone.   Having my dad or Emilio here would have topped my day off just right, but both now were sitting in the infirmary waiting on whatever their prognosis was.  

I took a deep breathe and I kept going.  I heard a door click shut to my right and I slowly walked that direction.   I weilded whatever weapons I could with a quick thought.  I was well practiced in this part of my job.  My gift was my natural weapon.

I opened the door and a man rushed out.  He was much older than Levi.  He was covered in blood, Emilio must have gotten a good shot in.  Though I couldn't see from wehre.  Maybe it wasn't his own blood.  He tried to topple me but instead slammed into the wall of wair and bounced backwards with a stunned look on his face.  

I heard a voice over a comms unit.  They were communicating, they were using our own systems against us.  There was more than one inside man, there had to be one in the control room.  I wished I could signal someone else.  But I was alone.  Such was my life it seemed.

He blinked at me and scowled before he took off running down the hall away from me.  I threw a wall of air in front of him and he bounced backwards again, this time falling on his ass.  I smirked.  

He turned around and got in a ready stance, like I was going to go hand to hand with him.  I let my smirk turn to a smile.  He took a deep breathe and he rushed me.  One last chance for him to stop.  I dodged to the side pushing him with a gush of air against the wall as he ran past me - much like a matador did to a bull.  He howled in pain and fustration.  

He pulled his knife from his belt and charged me.  I sighed.  Stupid man.  I reached out with my power as he came at me and I wrapped a cord of air around his neck and heard a distinct pop as he continued forward. His body fell slack to the floor and I knew without checking that he was dead.

I tagged a locator on his body.  Another thing I kept in my pocket at all times.  Sometimes you just needed to be ready to track something as a hunter.

I was still seeing signs of a trap, there were smears still heading the direction I had been going.  They were going to the roof.  Why?  There was no escape from the roof... Unless Levi intended to jump.  If he left the building we weren't going to find him.  He had to pay for this.  

I started sprinting again.  I took the stairs up two at a time. I didn't even bother with making sure I was going the wrong way.  From here ther was only one way up and there was only two ways down.  

Once at the door to the roof I saw a bloody hand print on the door.  Levi had blood on his hands.  Likely Dorian's.  The heat in my body rose, the mere thought that Levi had hurt Dorian made me angry.

I opened the door and I saw Levi looking over the edge.  He turned around with a grin on his face.  I wanted to punch him so bad.  Now I knew how people felt when I did it to them.  But it probably wouldn't stop me from doing it - habits were very hard to break.

"There is no place to go Levi."  

He scoffed at me.  "I watched you do this before.  It didn't look that hard."  

Little did he know.  It took me a long time to master the fall and the landing.  I had a few broken bones during the learning phase.  

I took a few steps forward and Levi threw a fireball at me which bounced off the air shield I still had up.  "What can't see the shield?"

Levi didn't answer he just jumped over the edge.  He had no wings of air, he had nothing he intended to do it on the fly, he was stupid. 

I ran to the edge and jumped over.  I formed wings of air but in order to catch him I couldn't wrap them around me yet.  I hated going head first but catching him was imperative.  I speared into him and we both started spiralling down.  I flung out my arms and the air started to slow but it had been 4 seconds since we started.  We didn't have time to slow.  Levi hit me in the face and I lost the ground pattern.  I could have fought back but I had to slow down.  This was too fast my anxiety rachetted up every second we continued at our accelerated speed.  I thickened the air and softened the ground and prayed that I had done enough.  2.... 1... and then I felt my body shatter upon impact.
