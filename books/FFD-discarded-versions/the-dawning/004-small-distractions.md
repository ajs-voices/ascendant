# Small Distractions
_Saturday, June 13, 2015 11:00 PM_

Things at HQ had gone as poorly as I had anticipated.  They were pissed I'd brought home yet another monster.  It meant more paperwork for them.  I didn't mind doing my side of things. Three hours filling out the required forms for three prisoners was better than having to kill a mother and a father of a small child.  Poor kid.  I knew he'd be sent to New York and watched inside the Academy - much like I had.  He'd grow up like I did.  I wished there was something I could do.

I took a cab to the airport.  It was a joy not having to drive around.  I was going to enjoy being back in the city without the need to focus on driving.  I could get lost in my own thoughts.  That is when I went anywhere, everything I really needed was inside the Apex Unlimited Building.  There was really never any reason to leave.

The closer we got to the airport the more apprehensive I became.  I could feel the tension in my shoulders, the tightening of my jaw, I felt like I could split wood with my teeth.  My palms were sweaty and I was snappy.  I hate being snappy. 

The lady at the ticket counter brought a smile to my face, she was a cute blonde with green eyes.  I mentioned a pair of emerald earrings that had once caught my eye as they dangled from some woman's ears.  "I bet they'd be divine against your neck."  She thought I was hitting on her and she grumpily handed me the ticket and checked my bags.  If I had been hitting on her I would not have mentioned another woman I sighed to myself.  It didn't really matter I was going home - by plane.

And then every bit of panic in my body started to show again.  I reigned it in quickly as I walked through the security check points.  Arms out, patted down because my gear was dangerous.  I only had one gun, but still I declared it at the counter and it was now safely stored in my luggage, but now I got the special treatment.  It could be coincidence, but I don't beleive in coincidence.  Everything happens for a reason, you just don't know what it is until later.

I found my terminal and sat down, there were several passengers waiting around already, I still had an hour to wait.  This was almost the hardest part - almost.  It came a close third.  I hate waiting.

There was an elderly couple sitting across from me.  The man kept glancing at me and I'd smile.  I couldn't figure out what he was doing.  Do I look that threatening?  I glanced down at my shirt and laughed.  I hadn't realized what shirt I'd pulled on.  "Wanna screw?"  A hand was holding out a screw.  It wasn't a lewd as some of my other shirts were, but I could have chosen better for a public situation like this.  I zipped up the hoodie that I was wearing to cover up the offending saying and the man nodded in thanks.  I couldn't help but chuckle to myself as I pulled out my phone and started reading whatever book was currently open in my queue...

It wasn't long before my section of rows was called and I was heading to the back of the plane.  I hated the back of the plane.  I hated the front and the middle too, but I really despised the back of the plane.  Thankfully I was not near the engine but still I hated the back of the plane.  I stowed my gear in the upper bins after grabbing my ear buds so I could listen to some tunes to calm down after we got in the air. 

I looked down in the seats and saw a cute little red head scrambling to fasten her seat belt as a small auburn haired kid started shuffling with the things she'd carefully balanced on her lap.

Someone tapped my shoulder, "Can you put this up there please, son?"

I smiled down at the elderly woman who'd been with the man who'd been offended by my shirt.  "Yes, ma'am."

"Such a poliet young man."  I heard her husband scoff at the thought.  "Oh hush Henry, it wasn't that bad."  She turned over to him and said ever so sweetly, "Wanna screw?"

I couldn't help but bark out a laugh as the old man blushed.  "Sir, I think you've got a keeper."

"45 years my boy, 45 years.  And she'll never change."

I grinned down at her, "There you go, ma'am.  I'll help you get them down when we land."

"Such a kind lad."  She patted my hand as she sat down across from me.

The cute little red head was busying herself with prep work for toddler in her arms.  I had to step aside to let a few other people pass before I could finish what I had been doing.  I pulled out the magazine I'd picked up inside the terminal.  I sat down with magazine and ear buds and the little red head next to me tapped my arm and I turned to look at her bright green eyes.  "You sure you don't want the window seat."

I shook my head and hoped my skin didn't turn that wonderful shade of white that gave away my fear.  I wanted to say there is no way in hell you'd get me that close to a window, but I didn't.  "No, this is okay."

She smiled and sat down working on the things she had been doing when the little boy climbed into my lap.  She scooped him up in her arms before I could even react, "Aidan, no."

I smiled at her, "It's alright, he won't hurt me." I winked at her, "Pretty sure a kid can't dent me."

She grinned, "You'll regret that later.  He is quite strong.  Seem him bench press his truck."

I laughed, "Have you now?  I'd like to see that."  

The preflight checks started and I listened to the tinny version of the annoying details.  I fought with the feelings of dread as they talked about the oxygen masks and the seat cushions as floatation devices. A little hand tugged at the ear buds that hung around my neck.  He pulled out of his mothers lap and into mine.  She reached for him with a disapproving frown, "It's okay.  You are sitting right here, the plane's all closed up I'm not going anywhere.  He won't hurt me or the ear buds.  And besides he seems like the perfect distraction while we take off."

She sighed with a nod but she watched me warily.  I didn't blame her.  Though I don't know why he wanted to crawl into **my** lap.  Kids always seemed to like me.  I have no idea why, maybe it was the relative age difference.  Margo and Dae'lin are always telling me I'm a child.  I grinned at the thought.

The little one tried to put my ear buds in his mouth, I pull it gently from his fingers, "Your ears, not your mouth."  I held the bud to his ears.  "When we get up higher I'll show you."

The plane jolted forward and I went backwards into my seat. My heart jump into my throat.  I hated this part.  Up and down were always the worst, down the hardest, but I had a little one in my lap right now.  I focused everything on him.  I could see small patterns around him flux and wane with each movement as he shook my ear buds.  I held out my hand and he dropped the ear buds in my hand and picked it back up and started dancing them around my hand again.  I watched the boy with curiousity.  I'd never seen patterns around a child so young.  Then again I'd never been around a child this young before except for myself and I can't see my own pattern.  I don't really understand why not, I just can't.

I took a deep breath to settle my nerves, but I don't think it worked.  Maybe conversation would help.  "My name is Nox, by the way."

She smiled up at me, "Stella.  And this is Aidan."

"Pleasure."  I beamed at her.  I hoped she didn't notice the sweat beading at my temples.  

The little one started complaining about his ears and climbed into his mama's lap and dozed off to sleep.  I couldn't help the grin that played on my lips.  It reminded me that I'd just ruined the life of another kid only hours ago, the grin faded into nothingness.  I hadn't even been home for an hour before Dae'lin called.  How had she known?  How long had she been trying to get a hold of me.

I put the earbuds in and started flipping through my phone in Airplane mode to find something to listen to when Stella asked, "What brings you to New York?"  She whispered softly so not to distrub her son.

"Been called home.  Boss lady says 'come' so I come."  I tried not to grin at the alterior meaning to the topic I'd just answered.  Dae'lin wanted more than that in reality.  I'd heard through the grapevine, namely Jace that Dae'lin and a few others were in strict negotiations with the breeders program over who got first crack at me like I was some prize stud to be fought over.  I tried not to sneer but I was sure it played on my face before I could mask it with my playful grin.

Stella hadn't noticed at all she was looking at her sleeping son.  "My mother set up a job interview.  She told me to take Aidan too.  Said they had a day care, and that way he'd not be a stranger when I got the job."

I nodded, "Sounds like a good place to work.  Daycare in New York can be expensive."

She smiled at me, "We'll see.  I have my reservations."  She obviously didn't want to talk too much about it, she changed the subject back to me, "Do you like what you do?"  I could live with that, I never turned down an oppurtunity to talk about myself.

"I love my job.  I get to see the world, meet new people."  I winked at her and grinned. I knew exactly what the next question was going to be before she even asked it, but I let her ask.

"What exactly do you do?"  I could hear the curiousity in her voice.

I had a lie for everything I did.  I'd claimed to be a bounty hunter from time to time, but I didn't think it would do much good with Ms. Stella here.  So I choose what my business card actually said, "I'm a security consultant."  Which in reality was what I did.  I secured the fate of the human race by hunting down and executing rogue supernatural creatures.  

She grined at me and shook her head in disbelief.  "You look too young to be a consultant of anything."

Too young to do what I do.  Few hunters lived much longer, stupid mistakes or underestimating the opponent typically cost us our lives.  Too young.  I laughed softly, "I had a very good teacher."  I could hear the praise in my own voice, "I was helping her many years before I actually finished highschool."

"Her?"  Stella's voice was filled with surprise.  "Most security jobs are held by men."

I grinned at her.  "Our firm has more men than women, but she is not a field worker, she's the one who assigns all the jobs.  She's a manager, and a mentor.  She taught me what I needed to know to do my job on top of all the other things that you need to make your life a prosperous one."

She shook her head, "Sounds hokey to me."

Stella was right it was a bit hokey.  "I suppose private schools get that luxury."  Another half truth, it was the only thing I could really tell her.  I couldn't exactly tell her the truth.  That I was raised by a race of supernatural creatures whose sole purpose in live was to polic the other supernatural creatures and exact justice for human kind.  Yeah I'd be put in an insane asylum for muttering such non-sense.

A grin spread on Stella's face as she giggled softly, "A wealthy brat then?"

Wealthy, god no.  I had a lie for that too.  "No, scholarship kid.  I was sent there because my mother couldn't handle me anymore.  They paid my way through so I could get my head on straight."  It wasn't really a lie.  While it wasn't a scholarship, the Venatori don't use money like humans do.  We own nothing, we don't earn money. And wealth is not determined by dollars but by status. 

She laughed softly and I wasn't sure if she was laughing at me or with me, "You don't look like you were a troubled child."

She didn't know the half of it.  I winked at her, "Looks can be deceiving, Duckling."  My life was a disaster and a half, I am surprised I made it through it as well as I did - unwanted, beaten and bullied being only the top three things that messed me up.

Her eyebrow raised and a micheivious grin split her lips in two, "Duckling?"

I had explained it so many times I was surprised she hadn't hit me already, I chuckled to myself, "Soft, Cute..."

"And?"  I felt like she almost could see through me.  Like she knew what I had meant by it.

I grinned coyly at her, "In need of protecting.  It's usually what I call most women."

She asked with intent, "Most?"

This woman was digging rather deep into me, I sighed.  "Dae'lin would kill me if I called her Duckling to her face."

"Your boss/mentor?"  It was not really a question she knew the answer already I could tell by the way she held herself.

I nodded, "How'd ya guess?"  The sarcasm dripped from my statement.

"Just lucky I guess."  She smiled at me and I knew she was at least flirting with me.  I had missed talking to people.  I'd missed flirting more.  "You like her?" she asked.

I shrugged offhandedly.  "She's a good woman. I look up to her."

"Now you are being coy.  You know that's not what I meant."  She laughed at me, and I couldn't help but grin back at her, she was feeling me out for my attachments to other women.  How cute.  Though she was a human woman, and I'd slept with plenty of them, but Stella had a child.  I couldn't risk that.  But chances of seeing her again were slim so I could flirt safely.

"Are you asking me if I'm attracted to her and that's the reason I don't call her Duckling?"  She nodded and I shook my head in return.  "She's a beautiful woman, but she'd kill me if I thought of her as anything more than at most a friend."  I paused a moment as the memories of her catching me with Nick plowed through my memories.  "She went ballistic when she caught me kissing someone in the halls.  Granted I'm sure it was for more than one reason."

Stella laughed, "And those reasons are?"

Oh my god, this woman was really digging into my personal life, what was she a shrink.  I didn't need another one in my life.  "Boy you sure want to get personal."  I sighed and answered her question.  "We worked together, he was my chemistry lab partner.  She frowns upon work place relationships.  Which filtered down into my schooling."

A rosy color spread from Stella's cheeks across and her neck, as she blushed, "He?  Oh.  I thought..."  

She was clearly embarrassed by the assumption that I was now gay and just being friendly.  I wasn't just being friendly, and I reassured her. "You thought that I was flirting."  I grinned at her then leaned over and whispered.  "You are not incorrect in your assessment of things. I am fond of both sexes.  Though it's not something I ususally lead with."

"I'm sorry." She grinned, "I thought my radar was off.  I've not met anyone since having Aidan.  Life has been too busy."

I smiled, "No apologize necessary.  Your radar is just fine."

The planed dipped for its final decent and my heart choked me as I felt the altituded change.  My hands flew to the arm rest and I could feel the tender flesh of the woman beside me below my death grip.  I closed my eyes and gathered my senses around me fighting the gripping panic attack that coursed through my body.

Stella pulled her hand from underneath mine and smiled, "Not a fan of flying"

I could feel the heat rising in my cheeks and my neck, "Not a fan would be an understatement."  I opened my eyes and looked at the cute little red head and her sleeping son.  "My first flight was not a good one."  I didn't really want to talk about it.  I had learned long ago that many of my issues stemmed from that abandonment of my mother.  My fear of flying is wrapped so tightly around it that it's hard to separate one from the other because the memories are so ingrained in one another.  I sighed, "I'm just glad that it all worked out so well." My statement dripped with sarcasm, and I hoped Stella would not pick up on it.

Once the doors were finally open and the cabin started to move I stood up and stretched my legs, I pulled the little old ladies luggage from the overhead bin and handed it to her.  She patted me on the arm, "Such a nice young man.  And that was such a nice young girl, I'm sorry you don't like girls."

Damn!  The woman had overheard our conversation and now thought I only liked men.  Not that it should matter, I was used to the bigotry that went with it, though she wasn't chastising my choices, only apologizing for the loss of a great girl.  I looked down and Stella and Aidan had already slipped past me, Damn! So much for that.

I fished a few more bags from the overhead compartments before I was the last one on the plane and ready to get back to solid ground.  The stewardess thanked me for the assitance and I grinned back, I really wanted to get out of the plane.

Once I was back inside the terminal on solid ground I could feel the world lifting from me.  I could see the familiar skyline and knew that I was home.  Truly home.

I sat down in one of the chairs to slow my panic and fears.  I had been able to hold it together, I'd help from a lovely little red head I was unlikely to see again.  I put my elbows on my knees and hung my head in my hands.  Moments later I saw a pair of small green chucks in my line of sight.  I looked up and Stella was smiling down at me.  "Maybe we can get some dinner tonight?  You can tell me a little about New York and what it offers me and Aidan?"

I leaned back in the chair and grinned up at her, "Isn't that my line?"

She grinned at me, "Not this time... Duckling... It's not a ..."

I intetrrupted her, "No worries Duckling.  Not a date, got it!."  I grinned at her with a wink.  "I'd love to."

I pulled my wallet out of my back pocket and handed Stella a nondescript business card.  "Call me with a time.  I'm sure I'll have to shift things once I get in.  Dinner will likely have to be late.  If that's okay?"

She smiled at me as she took the card and glanced at it.  "That's fine, but I'll need a babysitter after 7 pm."

"I can bring it over, that way we don't have to worry about the time, eat in, talk in peace and Aidan can do whatever Aidan does."

She smiled and leaned over and kissed my cheek.  A chill ran up my spine.  "Thank you, that sounds great."  If it wasn't a date, then it made me wonder what the kiss had been for.  I know I'm irresistable but she clearly said it wasn't a date.  Women are so confusing.

I watched as Stella left, I could still feel her lips on my cheek and I stayed in my chair dazed by what had just happened.
