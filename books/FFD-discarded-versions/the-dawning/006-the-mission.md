# The Mission
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 an hour or two later_

Jace goaded me the last few blocks before he parked his SUV in the complex next to the compound.  The cavern of the parking garage was another old memory.  I rarely used the vehicles in the City, mostly I was too young, and really I hated to drive in the City, out in the world it was great, here it sucked.

I took my bags to the elevator and I could still remember the elated fear that coursed through my body as I waited with Dorian all those years ago.  The door dinged and whooshed open and we stepped into the glass elevator.  It wasn't quite so bad right now encased in concrete, but once we went up a few more floors things would get bad.  I took a deep breath and turned to watch the doors.  

Jace laughed, "Man, you'd think jumping from a skyscrapper would break that fear."

I shook my head and closed my eyes shut. I remembered pressing my face into Dorian's dress pants, his scent was a comfort then, even though I was having a panic attack.  I took a deep breath and turned around to stare into the lobby as we rose up into the Apex Unlimited building that was once again my home.  

I saw the statue I created standing proud and strong in the grand lobby.  I smiled and Jace punched me in the arm.  "See you can do it."

I hit him back this time, my arm was getting a nice bruise.  Jace was about to hit me back when the door dinged and I turned around to look as another person entered the plate glass elevator.  Jace grinned and I returned the gesture, we'd been caught, but it wasn't anything really.

Once we reached our destination I was assualted by a small brunette bearing files and folders and started dragging me to a conference room.  I looked helplessly at Jace and he shrugged, "I'll take these to your room, catch ya round Nox.  Good luck!"

I gave him a dirty look as Dae'lin shoved me into a glass conference room.  We called it the fish bowl, I hated this converence room, I hated everyone seeing through the walls.  I could smell the floral perfume Dae'lin wore, she swore at me, "Damn it, Nox.  Where have you been?"

She was a picture of fury, her raven hair all over the place as if she'd been running her figners through it, her eyes were screaming dark spikes at me.  I was barely with her, I didn't have any answers.  My body was still floating through the fear of the eleveator and Dae'lin wasn't making matters any better.

I leaned against the table looking down at the floor and tried to take slow steady breaths.  The door opened and I saw a pair of black leather shoes step into my view.  I followed the legs up and couldn't really help noticing how well his pants fit.  "Dae'lin, maybe you should introduce us before you scold him in front of me."  His voice was soft and masculine and it sent a shiver down my spine. 

I let myself finish looking at the man I that had guided me through my childhood.  His khaki's and button up shirt were pressed and starched, perfection at all times.  I reached his face and knew that his mustache and goatee would be perfectly groomed and shaped.  He was smiling at me with perfect sparkling blue eyes.  His hair was only slightly mussed like he'd just run his fingers through his hair too.  He held out his hand to me with a hint of embarassment in his cheeks.  He had noticed me checking him out. "Dorian Vega, and you are?"

I winked at him.  "You don't recognize me?" I grinned and took his hand firmly, "Nox SÃ©tanta."  I hadn't seen the man in a least three years.  Apparently I wasn't as memorable to him as he was to me.  The look on his face said he was surprised to see me, and surprised to have me checking him out.  I turned in a hury to distract myself more than anything and walked around the conference table.  I sat down quickly and noticed Dorian had watched me walk around the table.  I wished I could interpret the emotions that I'd seen play on his face before they were hidden with a pleasant smile.  Was this going to be a problem?

Further away from the distractions I could see the patterns that evovled around Dorian. I saw distinct difference from the last time I'd seen the man.  Now that I thought about it, so had Jace.  Dae'lin had forever remained the same, the fire pulling so hard that it took over everything else in her fury.  

I could feel the pulse in my neck thrumming through my veins.  I do not recall Dorian being _that_ hot before.  Damn!  I shifted in my chair and looked at Dae'lin, "So nice of you to ask about my flight.  It went well.  I had a nice seat mate to keep my mind from playing games on me."  I fell into my normal mask without a problem, hiding everything that I could so that people had less to chastize me about.

Dorian chuckled and I forced myself not to look at him, but I could barely focus on what I was saying, "What's the problem, Dae'lin?"  I needed to concentrate, and Dorian was going to make that very difficult.  They both took a seat across from me and I could feel my heart racing. _Get it together!_ I chided myself.  I wasn't 15.

Dorian's smooth voice started describing the problem, "Someone is targeting the Venatori.  Two families specifically."  I quirked an eyebrown in question, it wasn't uncommon that we received hate mail and the like.  Yes vampires sending hate mail was common.  It was rather funny if you thought about it.  We were the things that bumped back against the things that went bump in the night.  We were the monsters to the monsters.  

Dorian continued, I was pretty sure he stopped speaking as my thoughts went elsewhere.  He knew me too well.  "Kai Videns youngest son was gifted a box that blew up in his face.  He is in critical condition in the Infirmary.  And just today my father has also received a package, but I notice it was emitting strange patterns, so I had it taken for investiagation."

There was only one question I had, "How are the bombs getting through the security in the mail room?"  

I already knew the answer, but Dae'lin responded her voice tight with exasperation at my inept question.  "We've gone through this with Kai.  The bombs are of all elements, formed at the same time the best we can figure.  There are very few who can see all four elements in the mail room.  Which is why you are here?"

"So you think it's a Cesari doing this?"

Dae'lin sighed, "No, Dorian does.  And he's the resident expert on all things Cesari.  I'll let him explain.  So far it's just the two families, and with Emilio and Kai working so close together it makes sense.  I... We don't expect other families to be targetted."

"I'll look through their cases see if I can find any connections."  I interjected.

Dae'lin sighed, "If you must.  Kai won't like you poking your nose around things, Nox.  He gave me a earful after your Ad Aetatem."

I sighed, I knew that would happen the moment he asked.  "Tough shit.  He can tell me to back off himself, and then I'll just keep looking anyway."

Dae'lin stood up and sighed, "I know.  The two of you will be the death of me.  Neither of you listen!"  She stalked out of the room, I grinned as her tight rear swayed out of the room.  I swallowed hard, when then hell did I let my hormones take over.  I stood up and walked around the table.

As I passed the seat Dorian sat in he stopped me with a hand against my chest holding a stack of folder files.  I could feel the warmth of his skin through my hoodie, I wished that I'd unzipped it.  I looked down at him with a grin and took the files from him, my fingers brushed against his as I could almost feel sparks.  My breath caught but thankfully Dorian spoke and I didn't have to ask what it was he was giving me.  "The information I have on Cesari for you to look through."

I nodded, I didn't trust my voice.  Dorian stood up his body brushed against mine before he took a small step back so he wasn't touching me, but I could still feel his presence in my bones.  "I examined the package my father had.  The craftsmanship is untrained, erratic.  They were too well put together to not have been done at the same time.  But the only person who has ever done those types of feats in my presense has been you."

I grinned at Dorian, "You think it might be me?"  I knew better than to think Dorian would think badly of my ability.  But I wanted to hear it from him.  

"I don't, no.  I wouldn't put it past your father, or mine to think of you as a suspect.  But you are the best candidate for the job, the patterns are there, if you can see them.  Maybe we can catch this bastard before he kills someone."  I don't think I've ever heard Dorian Vega swear.  His perfection was something that forbid such things, and yet he had.  Maybe a lot more had changed in the three years I was gone.

I moved towards the door brushing against Dorian's arm, "I'll look into it.  You know more about Cesari than anyone else has ever forgotten about them."  I smiled at him as I opened the door, "Anything else?"  I had hopes, but I knew they weren't for real, there was nothing I could offer him other than a good time.

He smiled and shook his head, my heart leapt at the sight of that smile.  I turned quickly and started in the direction of the adult residences.  Dae'lin called out my name from her office and I turned to look at her.  "Nox, we need to talk after you get settled."

I grinned at her, "You think I don't know what you want."  I could see the fiery woman blush, it was an attractive view.  My control was completely shattered and I had no idea why.  

Dae'lin hid behind her door before she shut it, "Either way find me.  We need to discuss it."

I sighed and nodded.  Dorian was watching the exchange and I shot him my best smile.  He returned it with a small smile of his own.  "See ya round."  I hope I did anyway.

Dorian nodded, "If you need to we can go over some of that later, after you've gotten things settled in."  My heart raced, _FUCK!_

The files were thick and I ran my fingers through the top corner and grinned, "I'm sure I'll need some help at some point."  I headed towards my room before my damn hormones got the better of me and I was acting like I was fifteen on the outside as well.
