# A Month Later
_Tuesday, July 14, 2015 4:45PM_

There was nothing but pain in the darkness.  And when there was no pain there were my nightmares.  I writhed in fear but my body could not move.  Garrett's face was clear in my minds eye.  I watched as I was unable to move out of his wrath.  The tentacles of air smashed across my body leaving huge scars that dripped with blood so dark I knew I was going to die.  

And then the peace came on wings of cinnamon and vanilla.  A soft current of pine and my fears drifted away.  Safe.  Home.  But as quickly as it came it went again.  The darkness crept back in and I felt nothing but fear.  Over and over the cycle continued.  Searing pain.  Fear.  Peace and then directly back into pain.  I wanted to die until those few moments of peace came and I knew there was something to live for.

The pain was less this go around.  I felt a cool breeze on my cheek.  I cracked my eyes open, the light was too bright.  I clamped my eyes shut.  My mouth was dry, I couldn't open my mouth, I tried to lick my lips but it didn't do anything.  I heard a movement next to me.  I heard a familiar voice yell, "He's awake."

I tried to open my eyes but the light was still to bright.  There was a shuffling and then there was less light.  I blinked my eyes I couldn't see anything but a blurry ceiling.  At least that's what I thought it was.  I couldn't move anything.  I saw a face above me, "Don't try to move."  I recognized the voice but I still couldn't make out the face and my mind was searching.  I couldn't make heads or tails of things.  I blinked furiously trying to see.  

The searing pain radiated through my body as I tried to move.  I felt hands on my legs, "Stay still son."

Son... Kai.  I blinked again and the images started to clear.  My father was sittting my side.  That was good.  Something tickled at my memory.  I should know something but it slipped from my mind as the pain made me pass out again.

The cycle started again.  Pain.  Fear.  Peace.  But each time through the pain seemed to lessen.  Pain.  And then the nightmare started again.  Garrett's face weilded glowing red eyes at me and I started awake and I felt that searing pain again.  I was sitting up in a hospital bed and I tried to yowl in pain but I croaked out nothing but a muffled groan. 

A woman rushed into the room.  She was wearing the white jacket of a doctor.  I saw her stethascope around her neck before she pushed be back to lie down.  Her voice was soft.  "Lay down Nox.  You shouldn't be moving.  I won't want to strap you down again.  Please stay still."

I complied. I didn't know why I couldn't move but the moment I did the pain lessened.  Or maybe that was the injection she shot into the IV in my arm.  I blinked up at her.  I vaguely recognized her and was about to say something when I felt my head lull to the side and my eyes slowly closed.  

The pain killers soon left my system as the nightmares took over.  I felt the slashes against my skin.  I could feel my skin knitting together.  It was a creepy crawling feeling as my body healed itself.  It was all over.  I could feel it everywhere like spiders were crawling all over.  I started awake but I didn't move.  My body or my mind remembered the pain from before.  My mouth was dry.  I tried to speak but nothing came out.  I tried again and managed a horse whisper "Water."

Someone next to me squacked. I could have sworn it was a baby.  I tried to turn my head but everything was so painful.  I felt a heavy weight put on my chest.  The soft scent of baby powder and baby wafted towards me.  I looked up at the clearning image in front of me.  "Hey babe.  Hold JJ for me I'll get the Doc and some water."

JJ?  Who the hell was JJ.  Jace had a new boy?  Son... Mia had her baby.  I looked down at the little one lying on my chest and grinned.  It hurt but I used air to undo the bounds on my arms and to hold the little one to me as I moved the bed to a sitting position.  Air was lovely tool when it hurt to do anything.  It hurt sitting but I was able to wrap my arms under JJ and look down at him.  My body ached everywhere.  But I seemed relatively intact.  

I wondered what day it was, how long I'd been asleep.  A woman in a white coat rushed into the room she looked frantic as I was siting there but she stopped at my bed side and was checking all the machines.  "How are you...." She looked at me with bright green eyes and I could see a million questions pass through them.  

I grinned at her.  "Doc."

A blush ran up her neck and to her ears.  I wasn't even trying to be seductive.  But she smiled back at me.  "Nox.  I'm Doctor Eriksen.  I've been looking after you since your fall."

I smirked.  "I didn't fall.  I jumped."

She gasped in horror.  "Do we need a suicide watch?"

I wanted to shake my head but I thought better of it.  "No ma'am.  I jumped to catch a bad guy.  Levi Hughes, did he make it?"

Jace walked in with a cup of ice chips heaping over the top.  "Dead, man.  He was on the bottom, between the fall and you landing on him he didn't make it."

I nodded.  "Dorian?  My father?  Emilio? How are they?"

Jace grinned at me like he knew something I didn't.  But it was the doc who answered.  "Both of the Vegas spent two days under observation.  Your father recovered well, neither Vega needed surgery despite the blood loss, the injuries were not enough to explain it."

I nodded and felt releif wash over me, everyone was okay.  I looked down at the sleeping kid in my arms and smiled at Jace.  "You make beautiful kids, man."

He laughed, "I do.  Don't I?"  He smiled proudly.  "But you look pretty good with a babe in your arms."  He winked at me suggestively.  I rolled my eyes at him and he laughed softly.  

The doc looked at the babe and frowned.  "I need to take a look at you.  He's going to have to go.  Your friend too."

"Ain't nothing Jace ain't seen before Doc."  My comment brought another blush to her face and I grinned.  Jace took his son from my arms and I felt colder than I had before.  I sighed, that wasn't going to happen to me for a while if I could barely move now.

But the doc never lost a beat, "Well either way I'd like him to leave."

I kept my mouth shut, I sorely wanted to add a sarcastic comment about wanting me all to herself.  Jace left with a wink, "I'll bring you back some food when I stop by after class."

My stomach rumbled at the mention of food, "Please."

The doc shook her head, "Not yet.  We don't want you to hurt yourself."

"Doc I'm starving.  Food can only help.  I'm talking just fine.  I don't think food is going to make things worse."

She shook her head and shooed Jace out of the door and shut it after him drawing the blinds and everything.  I couldn't help myself this time, "You really want alone time don't you?"  I was rewarded with another blush but she hastily went to flipping through her charts.  

When she finally found the right page the blush was gone, and she was all business.  "On June 16th you were admitted with severe injuries.  Injuries I'm not even sure a full Venatori could have recovered from."  She looked down at me with that teacher knows best stare as she delivered the next part, "But here you sit, unexplainable miracles later.  You are talking, moving and I'm pretty sure ready to get out of that bed.  We have to get more x-rays before I let you move around.  Before you eat solid food.  We don't want you to hurt yourself worse."

I laughed, "Worse than splatting on the ground at high velocity.  I felt every bone in my body shatter Doc.  There is no getting worse than that."

She gasped, "You felt it?"

I nodded, "I was awake, and completely conscious as I hit the ground."

"Poor boy."

I rolled my eyes.  "I'm alive that's all that matters."

"You are barely alive, Nox.  You should be dead like the other boy.  Why did you jump?"  She seemed curious about my reasons, like she didn't exactly beleive me.

"Levi, stabbed Dorian.  He had to pay.  If he got away by jumping - using something I taught him I'd never forgive myself."

"Dorian?"  She sounded shocked, "I didn't think you two were that close?"

"We aren't really.  But it was personal regardless."  I gave her a half smile, I didn't want to tell her how I really felt about him.  I wasn't completely sure what was real and what was the desire to want to be safe.  But was it so bad to want that?  I sighed.  

A nurse or x-ray tech, probably the latter, brought in a portable x-ray machine.  "Let's get you lying down again."  She reached over and held the button that lowered the bed flat.  I could feel her long carmel hair tickling my neck.  She smelled clean.  Like a trickle of water through a near dry creek bed.  I didn't know how to explain it really.  When I was lying flat on my back she let the tech do his job.  She stood back and I looked at her, really looked at her.  I gazed at the chaotic patterns around her.  They didn't know which way to go, or what to do.  I'd never seen an Eruditus with such chaos around them.  It made me look away. 

I stared at the ceiling while the x-ray tech arranged my long, apparently fragile limbs if his touch had anything to do with my state of hospitalization.  It was too long, too silent.  "So Doc, tell me the full extent of my injuries."

Her silence lingered on and I opened my eyes happy to see that my vision of her patterns had lessened and I could see her pretty green eyes again.  "That bad?"

She looked down at me from the screen.  "I'm sorry.  I'm not ignoring you, honest.  But you are a marvel.  Every bone is completely healed.  No Venatori heals like this.  What are you?"

I sighed, "Improbable."

"What?  She asked as the tech started wheeling away the machine.

I shook my head and winced in pain, "Nothing.  My injuries, what was I admitted with?"  Changing the topic was probably better.

She frowned, "Multiple fractures to nearly every bone in your body.  Severe organ damage.  Internal bleeding.  Everything you'd expect from a fall from an excessive height."

"And now?"

"As we expected the internal damage was extensive.  We didn't want to risk operating, we could only hope your body would heal it.  But no one expected you to survive.  And it's a month later and you are near to fully healed.  You are likely in pain from muscle atrophy and the healing process that's still going on."  She looked at me with amazement in her eyes, "You are a medical miracle."

I shook my head, "I'm not miracle.  Just Cesari."

She shook her head, "No you aren't JUST anything.  I would like to do extensive testing on you if you'll allow me."

I sighed, "Sure whatever."  I turned my head away from her and closed my eyes.  I was growing tired.

"That doesn't sound very energetic.  If you'd rather I didn't."  She was geniune in her feelings, but I was still leery of being a lab rat.  

But I didn't say that. "I'm just tired."  My stomach rumbled again, "And hungry."

"I will have them send you food right away."  She took one last look at the monitors and then at me and left my little room.  I closed my eyes and felt the gentle call of sleep take me down.  I was so tired.
