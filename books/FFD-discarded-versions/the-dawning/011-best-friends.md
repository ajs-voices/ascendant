# Best Friends
_Monday, June 15, 2015 7:30AM_

The sounds of my dreamscape changed from the snap of air and earth against my skin to pounding.  As the last blow was about to strike I started awake panting and sweating with someone beating on the door to my room.  My shirt was damp with sweat.  I groggily yelled, "In a second." 

I'd fallen asleep staring at the screen, my head hurt, my back ached and I felt even worse than I had before falling asleep.  I pulled myself from the bed and checked the time on my phone.  I was surprised to find the time later than I thought, I had apparently swipped my 4am wake up call and fell back asleep.  The bed had been too comfortable after sleeping on the ground for weeks.

I eventually made my way to the door and opened it slowly.  I peeked out the door and saw a grinning face beaming at me and then slowly frown, "Shit man!"  Jace pushed his way through the door.  "You look like shit.  Nightmares still?"

I nodded my head as I shut the door behind him.  I squeezed my eyes shut as he flipped on the light and started making coffee.  I smiled, he knew me too well.

Jace turned from the now brewing coffee, "Go grab a shower.  Coffee will be ready and then we can go get breakfast."

I nodded again and blew Jace a kiss in thanks.  He swatted it away as he always did and grinned madly at me.  I grabbed a pair of boxers and headed in to the bathroom, hoping there were towels of decent quailty in there.

I was rewarded with white plush hotelesque towels and was thankful for the decency of the compound facilities, so much better than some hotels.  They smelled of fresh laundry if only a little stale from being cooped up so long.  If I stuck around I would be able to decorate a permanant room, this one was bland for a reason, so it didn't offend anyone.  Blandness apparently was the least offensive of the possiblities.

The shower pressure was awesome and the water was hot.  I could feel the aches leaving as the water scalded my skin.  I felt dirty even though I'd not done anything majorly dirty.  I always did after my nightmares.  I truly would have felt better if I'd gotten my morning workout in but such was life.  Today I'd have to survive on coffee and a shower.

I finsihed up pulling my boxers on and walking out of the bathroom into a very cold room, I hadn't realized the air was down so low.

Jace gave a polite whistle and I grinned as I pulled out an ordinary t-shirt - just a little faded red, no sayings.  Least offensive today sounded good.  A black pair of jeans and my black hoodie would round out things with my Nikes.  

I tied the laces on my last shoe as Jace brought me a cup of coffee.  "Like old times."

I grined up at him and took the warm cup in my hands and drank a scalding swallow, "At least you didn't burn it this time."

Jace laughed.  "I missed you too.  Stick around this time alright?  I don't know if I can be a dad without my friend to keep my grounded."

"You will be great Jace.  You are good with kids."  He was.  He was always helpful to those younger than him.  He may not have been the brightest dude in school, but when it came to figuring out the little pnuemonic tricks to remember things Jace was king.  But then again Jace had a near photographic memory, but unlike Dorian his talent was for shorthands.  Another talent worthy of the Venatori.  Was I jealous?  Yeah probably.  I had to be honest with myself, to be normal one way or the other would have been great.

Jace started rambling in his southern cajun accent and I couldn't understand him. He flopped backwards and his hands flailed over his head.  And before I could react I watched my laptop fall to the floor.  Even Jace hadn't had the speed to catch it from the angle he was at.  He blushed furiously, "Sorry man."

I shook my head as I made my way around to pick it up, it was damaged beyond repair.  "I did need a new one."  It was about time to upgrade, but I hoped I could salvage the data, I may not own a lot but all my music was sitting on that harddrive and I'd like to get that back.

"I'll take it to IT to see if I can retreive the data."  Jace looked  pitiful.  I grinned at him, "It's alright, promise."

Jace sighed, "I'll help replace it.  But right now breakfast.  Your coffee is done."

I nodded, "Alright to breakfast, not to you helping replace it.  I can manage that all on my own.  I really did need to replace it."

Jason looked at my shirt and frowned, "What no naugty saying."  His frown deepened, "Mia made me get rid of mine, I could live vicariously through you, but NO, you have to be polite today."

I grinned at Jace, "I do own a few that aren't like that you know."

Jace sighed, "Mia says they are childish.  I guess I'm a grown up now."

"You are going to be a dad after all.  But we all know I am childish."  

Jace punched me in the shoulder and headed out the door, "I was too.  You'll settle down with someone sooner or later and they'll make you change too."

I barked a laugh, "Yeah right.  Me settle down?"  Of course it was all an act.  Margo says I need to find someone, and said I should stop pushing people away.  But she also confirms it's how I've survived with my fears so it's a coping mechanism.  One day, maybe I'll stop, when I find that right person.  Right now it didn't matter.

We walked downstairs, breakfast was in full swing, the line was empty, but the cafeteria was full of people talking and eating with friends or alone.  It was almost a homecoming.  Heads turned as I walked in, it was not a rare occurance.  It was offputting.  Thankfully no one stared it was mostly those looking up to see who entered and see if they'd have company, but there were a few sneers.  It could have been my imagination.

We started into the food service area and Ms. Sheila was standing behind the plate glass barrier in her hair net and apron and I smiled at her, "Good Morning Ms. Sheila."

She looked up from the plate she was dishing out with a smile.  "Well, look-ee here.  Ain't you a sight for sore eyes.  All growed up and everything.  I heard you were back in town."

I grinned, "All growed up, at least on the outside.  I'll have whatever you got cooking."

She nodded her head and started plating as she spoke, "I remember the first day you showed up here with Dorian Vega.  So small and quiet.  Look at you now.  Loud and obnoxious and not so small."

"Yes, ma'am, that was a long time ago."

She nodded and grinned at me as she handed me a plate. 

Jason chimed in, "True dat."

I rolled my eyes at Jace.  "Can't take the country out of the boy can we?"

Ms. Sheila rolled her eyes too.  "Just like we can't take the sarcasm outta you boy."  She smiled.  "Move along now before you hold up the line."

I laughed, "Line?  We are the last of the line." As the words left my mouth a gaggle of teenage girls entered the doorway.  Jace moved past me avoiding the girls and heading through the rest of the line.  I turned and watched him leave through the exit.  "How things have changed!"  Jace would have flirted before, growing up, becoming a dad, getting married, something hand changed my best friend - probably for the better.

I nodded farewell to Ms. Sheila, "Until dinner."  I gave her a flourished bow and the girls behind me giggled.  I turned to them with the same bow, "Ladies."  More giggling followed me out the door as I heard Ms. Sheila comment, "Always the flirt."  I couldn't let anyone down now could I.  

I put my food on my new tab starting and they'd deduct cost from my so-called pay check.  Not that I really got paid anyway.  It was all a supliment and no one ever said anything unless you go way over budget.  I'd never balanced a book in my life.

I sat across from Jace at a table, "Girls bother you?"

Jace shook his head, "No man, those are some mean bitches."

I raised my eyebrow at him, "Nothing they can say or do that I've not already had done to me."

Jace grinned at me, "Yeah but I ain't you.  And 'sides, Mia would kill me if they started spreading untrue rumors."

"Ah.  Mia.  That explains alot."

Jace gave me a dirty look as I glanced down at my plate to see what adorned it.  Bacon, eggs, extra toast and two glorious cups of coffee, one in a to-go cup even.  I adored Ms. Sheila.  

I started eating slowly, everything was a reminder of this place, even eating.  I'd been told not to rush my first day.  Lunch with Dorian, in the middle of my first test, I'd been shoveling food as fast as Jace was now.  I wondered if my friend was in a hurry.  I looked up at him and he grinned, "I'm running late.  Class."

I mouthed, "Ah!"  I looked up at the entrance of the cafeteria as I brought a fork full of eggs to my mouth and it froze there.  Aaron Woolbright, my ex-roommate, and my biggest bully walked in the door with a bunch of boys following in his wake.  I finished the bite of food as I saw them walk towards me and Jace. 

Where there had been whispers before, there was none now.  The entire cafeteria was quiet and all eyes were on me and Aaron.  I took a deep breath pushing down the fear that the man brought up in me.  

In the moments that it took Aaron to walk to me I assessed the large black man who once had threatened my everyday life.  He looked like he lived in the gym, the boys that followed were a poor imitation of him.  His baseball cap that he wore backwards sported the colors of the White Sox, his home team.  He still dressed and walked like the thug that he was.

Jace turned around to see what was going on and frowned, "Let's go Nox.  We don't need this."

I shook my head, "I'm not going anywhere."  I wanted to add he doesn't scare me, but he did.  I knew I could handle him, he was strong in fire, but he was a brute with it.  He was a firestarter too, he'd roomed with me that first night.  He was the reason Mushu had burnt.  The memory brought a small pang at the loss - my only friend.

Jace went back to his plate and ignored things as they started to play out.  Aaron stood beside me with a nasty smile on his face, I grinned mischeviously up at him, "Hey Aaron, long time no see."

Aaron hadn't liked my greeting, he pushed my tray across the table, I managed to grab the to-go cup as it flew past me.  At least I'd still get coffee.  I watched as it disappeared over the edge and crashed to the floor.  I turned back to Aaron and sighed, "Well that was uncalled for."

Aaron grabbed me by the collar of my t-shirt and hoodie and pulled me to my feet.  I didn't have time to react as a blow landed in my stomach knocking the wind out of me.  He threw the first punch, there were witnesses.  I really wasn't in the mood for this, but I wasn't going to let these bullies have another inch.  Aaron grumbled at me "No one wants your kind here.  Why don't I show you the door?"

I pulled myself out of his grasp and backed away with a grin on my face.  I fought through the pain that radiated through my adominal muscles.  I hopped he hadn't cracked a rib.  I laughed, "My kind?  You mean handsome, fun, eccentric?"

That earned me another punch but I was ready this time and I had a thin wall of air in front of me, his hand bounced back with ease.  He glared at me.  "Everything's always a joke with you punk.  I'll wipe that smile off your face."

The man truly was stupid he threw a second punch at my face I thickened the wall and he slammed hard into it.  "You little mother fucker."

He started gathering fire about him, I laughed and I wrapped him in air and sucked all the air out of the bubble.  Fire did nothing if it couldn't breathe, Aaron started gasping for air.  I smiled at him with malice in my eyes, "You want to play games.  Let's see how you do now that I can bend the elements freely out of Dae'lin's mindful eye.  What she gonna do now?  Send me away?  Yeah, that's a punishment.  Away from asshats like you.  Try again, Aaron."

I let the patterns go and Aaron gasped and started to rush me but his friends were smarter than he was and pulled him back, I smiled at them.  They could take it anyway they wanted, but I was grateful they were holding him back.

I collected the mess that had become of my breakfast and tossed it away.  I sighed at least there was still coffee.  Jace and I left the cafeteria I could feel the eyes on my back as I left and the rush of noise started up - most likely talking about me, but that was hardly new.
