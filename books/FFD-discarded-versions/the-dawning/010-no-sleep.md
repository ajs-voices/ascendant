# No Sleep
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 8:45 PM_

I needed to blow off steam.  Working had helped but the first moment my mind was left alone everything started trying to get my attention.  Things had not gone well with Stella, not that it really mattered, I was less likely to see her again than anyone else that was plaguing my mind.

I tried to focus on the task at hand, but it was difficult as I took the stairs to my room two at a time as fast as I could.  I eventually just focused on the stairs and my upward ascent.  I was barely winded when I reached the right floor, but I felt better.  

I opened the door to my bland room and grabbed my laptop that Dorian had safely set on the table with the papers he'd given me.  I let them drop on to bed, they bounced softly and sank into the comforter and mattress, that was a good sign anyway, it wasn't rock hard.

My bags were still on my bed and I moved them carefully to the floor so that I could use the bed to work comofortably.  I pushed the laptop up by the pillows and found a plug so my battery didn't die in the middle of things.  It was annoying getting the battery low message.

I set the papers down next to the laptop and laid down on my stomach and typed in to the database search feature of the Venatori records "Vega + Viddens".  I had no idea what it might bring up.  But it was my theory that there was a connection to something the two of them worked on. It was personal, the letter inside confirmed that suspicion.

There was nothing more to do than sit and wait for things to run through the search parameters and I didn't really need to be here for that.  I rolled over onto my back and thumbed through the files Dorian had given me.  It was a good portion of information that he'd collected on Cesari in general, me specifically, some stuff on Mark Green and the other resident cesari.  There seemed to be alot of statistics, stastics I already knew.

When I was in my early teens I had thought if I knew things about myself in terms of numbers and facts I might have a better understanding of things.  All it did was prove to me that I was different.  My birth alone was infintismally small.  The fact that I was cesari only slightly bigger than that.  My strength in the elements only slightly higher than that.  Put everything together and I was improbable, not impossible because here I sat alive and kicking.  Though sometimes I wondered if I was impossible.

Dorian also gave me a few odd cases of other Venatori who had gone rogue.  They had nothing to do with Kai or his father, but they were interesting reads.  But not interesting enough to keep my full attention.  I dozed and my computer dinged as the search finished and I was roused.

I rolled over on to my stomach again heedless of the papers that crumbled underneath me.  I assume they were my copies, Dorian was not one to give me originals or the only copy.  Dae'lin either for that matter - it was always copies, the originals weren't actually orginals either, as they were printouts of what was digitally entered.

The search results were anything and everything with mention of Kai and Emilio.  At the top were old entries from the headmasters and teachers during Kai's and Emilio's youth.  While they were not relatvant I hadn't expected to see them.   Dae'lin must have upped my security clearance.  I poked around those files for a little while.  

I found my father was a trouble maker.  Emilio was the peace keeper it seemed - always caught with Kai but always trying to stop things before they went too far.  Sounded like me and Jace.  Kai was also a firestarter and he spent a lot more time in confinement than I had. 

While I had only started one fire in my room. Kia had started five before he was released into general population.   The more I read about my father the more I found similarities between the way we grew up, and the more I found the differences too.   For everything we had in common there was a defined difference in things.  Kai was not disliked from what I could tell.  He was a perfect Venatori.  

Me, my sexual preferences were the least of my issues. If it were not for Jace I'd probably had it bad off if I survived at all.  Between the bullying and my own self-esteem issues I'm lucky I hadn't tried to kill myself.  But offing myself was not really ever an option, I liked myself too much.  I really don't care what others think of me.  They matter very little in the whole scheme of things.

I pulled myself out of Kai's life and our similarities and differences and back into the case.  I scanned for any mission that might stand out.  Something that would fit the profile Dorian had created for the perpentrator, if they were cesari and untrained. There was nothing in those files that pointed to anyone inparticular. 

There were two exile cases that I set aside to take a look at later.  I yawned and rubbed at my eyes, I could feel sleep on the edge and I hadn't slept well in ages.  The bed was at least comfortable, and I let myself drift into nothingness.
