# Surprises
_Monday, June 15, 2015 11:15PM_

We left the restaurant casually.  There were a few glares and dirtly looks from other patrons.  Obviously we were gay!  I hated bigots.  I held the door for Dorian and he gave me a brief smile before stepping into the night air.  I looked up and saw no stars.  Such was the way of the city.  I would miss the stars.

I wasn't exactly sure what we could do.  Dorian wasn't exactly the type of guy you take dancing.  Though I would love to move my body against his on the dance floor.  I had to push the thoughts away, I wasn't sure how much temptation I could handle.  I was being a friend - you don't sleep with your friends, at least that was my general rule.

This was supposed to be about patterns, so I lead the way to the compound.  We walked on the streets for now.  The train wouldn't be here for another few minutes and there were enough stops we could catch one later down the line.  I was enjoying the cool air and brushing my hand against Dorian's as we walked. It was easiest to show him things when we were around them.  So we went home to people watch.  With Jace we'd make fun of most of the people, but with Dorian I expected that it wasn't going to be the same.

The next subway station I went down and Dorian asked, "Home?"

I nodded, "You wanted to talk patterns, it's easier to show you where there is a diversity of patterns naturally walking around."

Dorian gave me a look I couldn't quite read, "Not what I expected..."

"You expected something more private?"  I tried to hide my amusement and the fact that I really did want to do such things.  

Dorian nodded, "Going home, implied a different activity in my head.  I wasn't exactly sure how to navigate that particular situation."

I gave Dorian a sympathetic smile.  I wanted to say _Me too_ but I didn't, "Not tonight."  I winked, "Shocking I know."

We rode the train home in a comfortable silence.  We choose to stand even though there were plenty of seats.  This time there was no touching, though I desparately wanted to.  I kept my eyes on the floor and tried to take in only Dorian's scent.  This particular car was overriding everything with old urine and body odor of the most unpleasant kind.

We reached our stop and I followed Dorian out the doors and walked a few steps behind him admiring his back side before I caught up to him, my thoughts were all over the place again.  I was feeling 15.  Dorian held the door for me as he had been the entire night, his hand sliding along the small of my back.  It was the gentlemanly thing to do and it made me laugh inside to think this was not how it usually went down for me.  But his touch made me shiver and I had to fight every fiber of my being stamping down the attraction that continued to grow for Dorian.

I headed for the elevator and Dorian followed.  I watched as the plate glass elevator made its descent and I couldn't help the shudder than ran through my body.  The door whooshed open to go back up and we waited while people filed out and we stepped inside.  We were the only one's standing in the glass box.

"To the roof I assume?"  I nodded and Dorian pushed the button to the top floor; we'd still have to take the stairs once we reached the top.  We rose up and up in the plate glass death trap.  I closed my eyes and focused on the soft scent that made me feel safe.  Dorian put his arm on the railing behind me and leaned in close, "This is what I didn't like." 

I spoke softly, "Can't be helped."  I opened my eyes and turned towards Dorian.  He was impossibly close.  I whispered, "I am fine though, I promise.  Not going to crumble or collapse in a crying heap or anything."

Dorian chuckled, "Good to know."  

Dorian didn't move away and I couldn't help taking in a deep breath.  This close I could smell the sweet wine on top of his usual calming scent.  I whispered, "You smell delectiable."

Dorian looked at me with a shy smile. As we rose higher and higher Dorian whispered back, "I hadn't expected this."  He sounded as out of breath as I felt.  I wanted to ask what he had expected, but Dorian continued, "You are trouble Nox."

I grinned, "I know."  We watched the numbers slowly reach their apex and before the doors opened Dorian had already stepped away from me.  This wasn't my first crush and yet I was acting like it everytime he touched me.  

We headed towards the stairs.  The door to the roof was already propped open and I could hear all kinds of people up there already.  I could see the panic in Dorian's eyes as he walked with me up the last few stairs and on to the roof.

I lead Dorian to a back corner of the throng where I knew a bunch of milk crates stood for seats.  Dorian kicked the dust off of one of the crates before sitting down, I hadn't bothered.  I sat close to him but I made sure not to touch him.  Image was everything for Dorian.  And I wasn't part of that image.

I could see some familiar faces, but the majoity of them I didn't know.  I could see alot of air benders, and a few who could do both air and earth, but what was shocking was the amount of people who couldn't bend anything at all.  I commented to Dorian, "Seems ato be a lot of non-mangnus up here tonight."

Dorian looked around, "How can you tell?"

I smiled, and so it began.  "A distinct lack of patterns around them.  No pull.  No push. They just are."

Dorian leaned closer so I could hear him over the crowd, that seemed to be getting louder and louder,  "Describe the patterns around someone, anyone, just not me."  Dorian smiled, "I don't want you staring at me that intently."

I laughed and I didn't want to tempt myself with my smart ass comment about wanting to watch him all night long.  I nodded towards the man in front of us with his back to us, "The guy in front of us, the one in the jeans and the Knick's basketball jersey.  He's a water bender.  Water is always hard so probably not a good one to use but he's the easiest to see right now.  The patterns shift like water around him.  Imagine that each element is a color and if I were to paint a static image of him in one percise moment..." I used the empty space in front of us and used my finger to draw with fire leaving a lasting vision. "The lines are exaggerated but the pattern is the same."  The lines faded quickly as the fire disappated. 

Dorian nodded.  "Okay, they flow around him like water, I think I can see something. It's faint though."

I nodded, "It'll get stronger with practice, but the strength in which you see it as well, usually says how strong they are.  I'd peg him around a 3, able to duplicate given a strong source."

A figure stepped out of the shadows and stood in front of us.  The only things I saw in my field of vision was a pair of faded blue jeans and an old pair of canvas converse.  I looked up with a grin and saw Jace standing there.  He was grinning down at us, "You two having fun?"  

Jason turned to the crowd, "He's finally here."

I stood up and looked around, "You waiting on me for something?"

The crowd cheered.  Jason smiled, "Of course.  Rumors flooded the compound when you jumped this morning."

I nodded, "That's why there is so many up here tonight?"

"That and Skylar and Van are throwing their last hurrah!"  Dorian was standing next to me but slightly behind me like I was his shield.  I hoped he didn't dart off the moment he felt uncomfortable, I would leave with him.  I grabbed his hand from behind me and held on to it descretely.  I wanted to stay with him.

Two others joined us, I vaguely remembered them.  I could feel Dorian tug away, I pulled him back and turned towards him, "Wait, please?  Let me see what they want then we can go."

Before Dorian could answer the girl who was about Jason's height brushed the red lock of hair away from her face.  She smiled at me, she had to be Skylar.  "Jump with us.  We'd love to have our last jump with you.  Van and I are going to Brasilia in a few days, we won't have this type of jump again for a long time."

I shook my head, "I don't know.  Let me talk with my friend first and I'll let you know."

Jace pulled the two away, "They are on a date, let's leave them some more alone time."  

I sighed, it wasn't a date, but I really wanted to spend the remainder of the night with Dorian.  I would love to jump with him, share that with him.  It was almost heaven.  I could share it with him even if there was nothing else to share...

Dorian grinned at me, "I never knew you were a cult leader."  His comment brought me out of my thoughts.

I smiled, "Neither did I."  I stepped closer and frowned, "I'm sorry about this.  We can go."

Dorian shook his head, "No stay, jump, be with your friends."

I smiled and shook my head.  "They aren't my friends."  I held out my hand to Dorian, "Jump with me."  I leaned closer so only he could hear me whisper, "I'd very much like to share this with you."

Dorian shook his head, "I don't think that's a good idea."

"Don't trust me?" I asked with a grin.

"I do trust you.  Just..."

I asked again, "Jump with me?  It's 8 seconds of your life and I won't ask it of you again."

"8 seconds until I splat on the ground."  Dorian was afraid of jumping.  I beleive he trusted me, but the thought terrified him.  It used to terrify me.

"I won't let that happen.  I promise.  I won't let you go."  I put my hand on Dorian's waist and pulled him to me.  I pressed his body against mine.  I whispered "I won't let you go.  You don't have to do anything but hold on.  I'll take you for the ride of your life."

Dorian chuckled in my ear, "That could be taken so many ways."

My heart was pounding, my blood was rushing to places that made my jeans tighter than usual.  I was breathless in Dorian's ear.  "Yeah."  I begged, "Jump with me?  please?"  I wanted this as much as I wanted Dorian in that moment.  I wanted to feel the rush of the wind on my skin as I watched Dorian.  I wanted to feel the thrill on the landing with Dorian in my arms.  

Dorian took a setp back and looked at me.  I couldn't imagine what he was looking for, what peice of information I held that would lead to his answer.  He frowned and shook his head.  "I don't think that's a good idea."  He pulled away from me completely, "You stay.  Jump.  Have fun.  I'm gonna go."

I shook my head, "No, I told you **we** could go."  I smiled at Dorian.  I hoped it was more reassuring then I felt.  I didn't need to jump or fullfil someone elses dream, right now I was doing one thing and one thing alone - being Dorian's friend.  He didn't want to be alone after his mother died.  I would be that friend for him, because I didn't think I could be much else with him.  I would take what I could get.  "Stay here.  Let me give them my best and I'll be right back."

Dorian nodded, but I didn't think he was going to stick around.  I stood there staring at him for a few moments before I turned and wound my way through the crowd.  I found Jace with Skylar and Van, they were chatting with excitement.   They were going to be disappointed but I didn't really care.  I walked over to them shaking my head.  "Sorry guys.  I have other plans tonight.  I can't jump."

Jason smacked my back with that "atta-boy" smile.  He thought this really was a date.  And again I wondered what Dorian had really understood about Jason's activities.  Skylar pouted, "It's alright.  Maybe next time."

I nodded and turned around to find Dorian.  I found my way back to where I'd left him and he wasn't there.  _Fuck!_  I knew he wouldn't stay.

I took a deep breath and accepted the fact that the night was over.  I could jump but my heart wasn't in it now.  I started down the stairs, at the bottom of the landing Dorian sat and looked up as he heard my footsteps.  "I needed some quiet."  

I gave him a small smile.  I was neither happy nor sad to find him waiting on me.  That small moment had changed everything.  "What do you want to do now?"  I asked flatly.

"Something a little more calm and peaceful with less people."

"What did you have in mind?"

"A movie, popcorn, something tame."  I nodded.  I would keep Dorian company as long as he needed me to.  We rounded the first bend of the stairs and Dorian asked, "Why did you want me to jump with you?"

I shook my head, "Doesn't matter."

Dorian stopped and when I stopped at the bottom platform I was looking up at him, he was frowning down on me, "It does matter.  Do you want me to jump that badly?"

"No, Dorian, I don't.  I won't make you do anything you don't want to do."  I started walking away and I could hear Dorian walking behind me, his super human speed was an advantage he had used to catch up.

He asked softly, "You are mad?"

I stopped and turned around.  Dorian bumped into me.  I could see his bright blue eyes shining at me in the dim light.  "I'm not mad, Dorian.  I thought you left.  I don't deal with rejection well."  He was close enough to kiss and I had to keep my eyes firmly locked on his to keep myself from going there.  

I swallowed the lump forming in my throat as Dorian asked, "Why did you want me to jump with you?"

I dropped my gaze.  My mouth suddenly went dry and I felt like if I said it, he'd just be gone forever, but he asked again and Dorian hated to repeat himself.  It was a lesson you learn quickly.  I whispered, "I wanted to share something intimate with you."

I turned and started back down the stairs.  This time I didn't hear Dorian's footsteps follow right away.  But they did eventually start.  I stopped at the landing to Dorian's floor.  Mine was still a few flights down.  I waited for him just inside the stairwell.  I saw his leather shoes first, and watched as he took slow steps down towards me.  I never raised my gaze from his shoes.  I was afraid to meet his eyes.  I asked softly, "Still want company?"

Dorian hooked a finger under my chin and my eyes instantly rose to meet his.  It was a gesture he'd used often in the early days.  He gave me a comforting smile, "If you want to."

I nodded in the direction of his door, and he opened it and lead me through with a hand at the small of my back like he had been all night.  I swallowed back the pain and just walked.
