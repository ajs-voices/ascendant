# Hunting the Inside Man
_Monday, June 15, 2015 6:30PM_

The camera in front of the apartment was still running, and I let it continue with its normal routine as I started running the recorded feeds backwards.  I blinked as I saw the explosion through the door, or rather under the door.  It made my heart stop and my body felt drained.  I couldn't imagine what had happened.  Or what had killed Mrs. Vega.  I had to push the thoughts away as I ran through the feed backwards.  It was such an odd feeling watching the door knowing that the woman I was looking for to emerge from her home was dead now.

As I sat there waiting, knowing what happened my phone rang and I jumped at the sound.  I pulled my phone from my pocket and answered, "Hello?"  I tried to pay attention to both things but I knew things we going to get hard.  

A small voice chattered at "Uh... hello?"

Soon the chattering stopped and it was just dead air.  "Sorry, Hey Nox. Aidan stole the phone as you I called you."

I grinned, "No problem.  I was a little worried.  I'm surprised you called."

Stella sighed, "Yeah bout that.  I'm sorry.  I am not good at this."

I laughed, "Neither am I."

"So friends okay?"

I sighed, "Yeah, it'll do.  How'd the interview go?"  I promptly changed the subject I didn't want to dwell on what had happened.  Or on the fact that this little woman wanted to be my friend.  She hardly knew me.  Hardly knew the person I was.  She just met me.  I could feel my mood plummetting, but I focused on her.

Stella laughed, "I got the job.  I can't believe it.  I talked with her for like ten minutes, and then she offered me the job.  There is a dinner meeting tonight, which will determine whether or not I take it I guess.  Apparently there is a lot of information I need to know beforehand. I get to meet some big wigs."

"I'm glad you got it.  When do you start?"  It sounded real good, almost too good to be true.

"Two weeks."  Stella sounded ecstatic.  "I fly home tomorrow and I'll be back in a week.  They are going to show me places tonight too.  I'm really in shock. I want to celebrate, but I don't think I have time before I fly back home.  Maybe after I get back you can show me around town in celebration."

Emilio cleared his throat and I nodded, "Yeah sure.  But right now I can't talk.  I have an important task at hand and my partner in crime here is not liking me talking right now."

"Oh, that's alright.  I have to get ready for dinner and Aidan's things together.  I should have called earlier, but I was so excited I called my Mom and we talked for hours."

To have that close a relationship with a parent was not something I understood.  Though Jace, he and his family were close.  I'm surprised he stayed here instead of going back home to the south.

"Sounds like fun.  Call me when you land tomorrow so I know you got home alright."

"Sure thing.  I'll talk to you tomorrow then."  Stella didn't wait for a goodbye, or anything as the phone call went dead.

I sighed, "Sorry about that."

Emilio turned with a smile, "Girlfriend?"

I shook my head, "No, I barely know her." I stared at the monitor in front of me watching it in reverse at double speed.  "She's human, sweet and all.  Not the type of girl you love and leave with a child on her hip."

Emilio paused his feed, "You don't want to be with a human?  Are they just toys for you?"  From anyone else I would have taken it another way, but he was the father of a man who'd cared for me most of my life.  He had to get it from somewhere.

"They aren't toys.  I don't have a problem sleeping with a human girl, but I have a problem with accidents killing a mother."

Emilio nodded, "Ah, the inevitable truth of your birth haunts you."

I pause the feed and turn to Emilio, "I like her.  She's sweet, a good mother.  And she only wants to be friends.  She likes to probe, she found out I like guys and that I have the hots for one in particular."

Emilio chuckled, "And it comes down to someone else."  He chuckled again but he said nothing as he turned back to his screens.

I started my screen again and we watched in silence.  I watched as Mrs. Vega emerged from the door with a package in her hand.  I sighed, "She had the package before she came home."

I started watching backwards until I lost sight of her and paused the syncronious feeds, "You know the cameras better than I do, maybe you should run this one now?"

Emilio laughed, "We all have our specialties."

I nodded, "And mine is not this."  I grinned at him as I moved my chair to the side and let him have the controls.  He quickly and easily found the next camera to follow and we watched as she walked backwards with the package in question.  I had plenty of time to study it.  It looked like it had come from the mailroom.  The stamps were the same, but that was easily enough to fake.

"We should get a list of employees who have been new in the past few months to see if we can find any coorelations."

Emilio nodded, "Send your father that message.  He can handle it."

"You think he'll listen to me?"

Emilio laughed and handed me his phone.  "Use mine.  No smiley faces or anything or he'll know it's not me."

I wouldn't do that anyway, but I nodded as I found Kai's contact in there and started a text, "Stamps all look official.  A list of mailroom employees over the course of the past few months might yield some help.  Any missing equipment too."

I read the text to Emilio and he nodded, "Good thinking."  I hit send and off it went I handed the senior Vega his phone back and continued watching.

We followed Mrs. Vega through her life backward to the best of our ability.  And we eventually hit what we were looking for, the moment she was handed a package, from a kid wearing a White Sox hat.  And that was about all we could tell about the person.  He was wearing jeans.  We had an exact time now.  We could coorolate times of every person in the compound now.  We had much more information to go on.

"Do we need to search Nick's receipt of the package?  Or Kai's delivery?"

Emilio shook his head.  "We could search Kai's place but I suspect it's the same kid, the hat was seen at the hand off for Nicolas, Kai and I already searched."

"So we need to look for the hat then."  Emilio nodded.

"We should go find Kai.  He'll want in on this."  I nodded with a sigh, Emilio put a hand on my shoulder, "It'll be alright he's doing better with you here, the way you handled the bomb was impressive I think."

I scoffed, "I'm sure it's because I didn't blow him up."

Emilio gave a strained laughed as we headed to the common area where Kai was holding the all hands meeting.

As we neared the common area my stomach growled at the smell of the evening meal finishing up.  I realized at that moment I hadn't eaten anything except for that one bite I'd taken before Aaron tossed my food to the ground in one swift push.  We passed a vending machine and I grabbed a dry protein bar.  I didn't particularly like these things but it would help me finish off the rest of my day.

We found Kai just as I finished chewing the last bite of the dry food I'd forced into my gullet.  Kai glared at me, he looked like he was ready to spit nails, but he didn't say anything.

Before Kai could say anything or get angry at either one of us I spat out, "Emilio and I saw the same kid with the Sox hat give Mrs. Vega a package."

"Whoever owns that hat we need to find them."  Kai said rather blandly.

I nodded, "Yeah we do."

My father blinked at me, I think he was confused as we agreed on a course of action.  It was not something we'd done as of yet.  Kai looked like he was waiting for something bad to happen.  Or for me to make a smart ass comment.  Or maybe say something stupid.  I must have disappointed him because he frowned, and then he turned away from me.  I felt my heart drop.  I don't know why but it did, whatever it was it hurt.

Emilio and Kai started walking in the direction of the dormitories.  Kai looked back at me and nodded, "Well come on, we need all the help we can get.  Tell Dae'lin we will start in the dormintories.  She can wrangle others for the adult residences."

I nodded.  Emilio added, "Sahara and Eli are joining us in the dormitories.  I texted them while you were making eyes at your son."  That earned Emilio a glare and I was thankful that Kai didn't see my smirk.

Kai nodded, "I'll have the rest of mine joins us in the dorimitories as well."

With the plans laid, I sent Dae'lin a text detailing our plan of action as we walked through the common area to the boys dormintory.  Emilio added, "We should start in the boys.  Nick says it was a boy that gave it to him.  Highschool age."

Kai glanced back at me as I tried to ignore their conversation.  He looked back at Emilio and nodded in my direection, "_He_ tell you that?  I know I never said anything."

Emilio laughed, "Yes, Kai he did.  We've had a grand talk about many things.  Leave him be."

Kai sighed, "Fine."  He muttered, "He has been useful."

I looked up but neither of them were looking at me.  The prior heart dropping was redemed, this man was going to be the death of me - the ups and the downs were not helping.

As I ran through the facts around in my head.  Something was missing and I couldn't but my finger on it.  Some connection that I needed to make. It pulled at my memory like a moth to the flame.

The boy's dorimitory was in an uproar by time we reached the double doors that lead to their common room.  Mr. Lance greeted us with a smile.  He'd been with the Academy for more years than any of us had been alive, every boy who stepped into these doors had come under the care of Mr. Lance.  All three of us paid the man his just due.  He was a simple man and he always looked liked he'd been rustled from bed.

Mr. Lance sounded annoyed as he asked, "Do we have to do this?  Now?  We were in the middle of dinner."

Emilio stepped away from them and put his arm around the older gentle man.  I wondered how old Mr. Lance was, he had to be pushing 80 at least.  "It is best that we do it now.  The boys and yourself are welcome to go back to the cafeteria and finish.  It might be better."

I laughed and the three older men looked at me.  I explained my outburst. "Would you let someone rummage through your things without your presence? I know I wouldn't."

Kai nodded, "The boy's right."  He looked at me and in a much louder voice, spoke to the common area,  "We will do this as quickly and as orderly as possible.  Everyone standing outside their rooms.  Do not enter or go in until one of the venatori are there."

It wasn't long before Sahara and Eli entered through the same double doors that we'd come through. Emilio sent them down the right cooridor.  After they left Emilio gave Mr. Lance instructions for the Vidden's children to go down the center cooridor.  We were going down the left.  Each group got a master key.  With each of the kids there it was unlikely we would actually need them.

There were about 20 halls down each cooridor with between 1 to four children in them.  The first two doors in each cooridor was painted orange and that was were I stopped in my tracks.  I stared at the door feeling my panic rise.  The dormintories were not the same as the class rooms.  But an orange door was still an orange door.

Kai put his hand on my shoulder and I jumped.  My heart was pounding and I knew beads of sweat had formed on my forehead.  "Bad memories for me too."

He said nothing else and opened the door to show me there was no one in the room.  The bunks were empty of everything.  No sheets, no blankets, nothing.  But I went in anyway and looked in all the possible hiding spots.  It was possible to have left things here even if you didn't stay here.  But I found nothing.

I moved on.  I wondered how much my father actually suspected why it bothered me, it wasn't for what he thought, not because of the fires I'd started, or even the bullying I received as a child.  It was all about fear.  My worst nightmares come alive.  I swallowed that fear and moved on to the next door.

Well the third door on my side of the cooridor.  Kai had one side, I had another and Emilio was going between both sides one ahead of us each time.

The first room had four bunks and all four were perfectly dishevealed from the morning wake up call.  I grinned as I looked around.  There were no baseball hats lying around in plain sight, more the pity.  I really wasn't looking forward to trashing someone's room.  So I started looking in the more open spaces at first - under the bed, in drawers and closets.  I used my gift to see if there were any thing being concealed.  I found nothing in the first room.  

I glanced in Kai's room and found he was being a bit more throrough.  But Emilio's handy worked was less messy.  A few over turned books here and there.  But not a mess that Kai left.  

When we reached the end of the cooridor Kai had found three white sox caps.  Emilio and I had not been so fortunate.  Or unfortunate, depending on how you looked at it.  But to our benefit, all of Kai's hats had been hanging on the bunks in plain sight.

The Vega children found one hat and Kai's children had found none.  It made me feel slightly better at having found none. All the boys were detained and sent to the office floors for interrogating.  I felt bad for the boys.  But it was necessary, even I understood this.  Discomfort of the few for the greater benefit of the whole.

Their search had taken close to two hours to finish, in that time two girls were found by some of Dae'lin's reconosense groups.  There were also a baker's dozen of adult residences that had been found with a White Sox hat in their possessions.  There was no telling how many suspects they had now, the number of adults could vary from two per residence to upwards of six and seven depending on the living situation.  The Venatori adults liked to bunk together as they didn't exactly stay at HQ much.  You never knew who was in town and who was not.  It was going to be a mess.

The entirity of the residential search took two hours.  Two hours for everyone who lived in this building to endured an invasion of their privacy.  We could only hope it bore fruit.

I was starving now.  I could feel my stomach rumble, I knew others could hear it too.  But there was still work to do.  Each person needed to be asked about their wearabouts, why they had the hat, and determine if they were cesari.  I could easily do that.  And I did.  I looked at each person carefully.

There was about 64 people that I had to look at, but it was fairly simple to do.  I could tell from a glance that none of them where cesari.  I wrote down a persons name and their desigation by what I saw  I only asked each person their name.

I noticed that Aaron was there.  He looked angry.  He looked out of place and like he should have been one of the intergogators instead of being interogated.  I smiled at him as I took in his pattern.

In addition to their name and designation I drew a simplistic pattern around them that maybe someone else could see later.  It took a lot longer than I'd have liked.  But when I was done I took my notes to Dae'lin.  "This is about all I can do to help with the interogation."

She took the paper from me and glanced at each one, "What's this?  We already know this."

I smiled.  "I only asked them their name.  I drew a simplistic pattern I see around them, and what designation that tells me a person is.  I'd be interested in seeing how wrong I am.  But I can't help anymore."  My stomach took that oppurtunity to growl loudly.  

Loud enough Dae'lin frowned at me. "When did you eat last?"

I laughed, "Honestly, I've not had a decent meal all day.  Aaron decided my breakfast was not good enough to eat as it landed on the floor.  I had a power bar not long ago." I shook my head, "I know, not good, I got distracted with everything.  I'll go eat now unless you need me?"

Dae'lin nodded, "You've given me your insight I think we are good.  Go eat."  Dae'lin looked at her watch, "Cafeteria is done with dinner, won't be much left I'm sure."

"Yeah I know.  I'll manage.  Even if that means running to the store to get food to make."  

Dae'lin laughed, "I forget you actually like cooking."

I grinned, "It's not so much as like as it's a necessity I learned to do so I didn't have to eat in the cafeteria all the time."

Dae'lin gave me a small shove in the direction of the door.  "Go eat before your stomach chews its way out of your belly."

I laughed a I quickly snuck into the stairwell and headed towards my room.  I wondered how trashed it was.
