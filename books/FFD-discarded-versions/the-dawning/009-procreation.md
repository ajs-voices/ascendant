# Procreation
_Sunday, June 14, 2015 7:15 PM_

I stopped at the same Starbucks on the way home and grabbed the same thing.  I didn't expect to be sleeping the way I felt, so the coffee wasn't going to hurt that any.  I took the stairs.  I didn't feel like adding more to my already full plate.  My father, my dreams, Stella.  The only good thing that happened was finding out I liked Dorian, and that wasn't looking great either.  So my mood was shot when I walked into the main office area.

A crowd of people were standing in front of the stair well their backs were to me.  A familiar face turned and saw me and slipped away from the mass of questions and answers that I couldn't begin to understand with everyone talking at one another.

Dorian's bright smile and blue eyes faded the moment he saw me.  I had to look bad.  He put his arm around my shoulders.  "You should go before they see you.  You'll just get put to work."

I shook my head, "Work is fine."  I smiled at him, "Thanks though."

Dorian nodded and I slipped out from under his comforting arm and walked to the edge of the crowd.  They were all asking questions, and Dae'lin was doing her best to control things.  My father rounded a corner and he took charge.  "Everyone.  Just go.  We've got it under control."

The crowd looked at him and dispersed, it was kinda funny really.  It left Dae'lin standing exasperated until she saw me and then her fury rose.  I could feel the temperature in the room rise.  Kai looked at her and frowned, "Dae'lin, just stop.  We don't need your boy toy here to look at it, we can figure it out."

Boy toy.  Is that what he thought I was.  I'm glad he thinks so little of me.  I frowned, but I asked, "Look at what?"

Dae'lin frowned, "A package your father got.  I want you to look at it.  His so-called experts let the other one blow up."

I started to ask something but Dorian intercepted my question, "No one was hurt.  They had it contained." He turned to Kai, "Let him look, it's not going to hurt anything."

Kai sighed and nodded, "Fine.  I want to watch."

Dae'lin lead the way towards the testing rooms, at least it wasn't a fire starter room I don't think I could have done that again today, and definately not with someone watching me.  Though had I known Dorian was around I probably would have moved on instead of tried that.

Dorian walked next to me, he kept glancing at me, I assured him, "I'll be okay."

He nodded, "As you say."  He still shot me glances but I did my best to ignore the questions that ran through my head.  Kai and Dae'lin lead the way.  Dorian and Kai went in and Dae'lin caught my arm before I could go in.  "Where were you?"

I laughed, "Does it matter?  I'm here."

She sighed, "Yes, it matters.  Jason told me you had a date."

"So?  It's not any of your business."

"You know damn well it is my business."  Dae'lin shouted at me.

My hackels rose and I took a step back.  "It is no concern who I sleep with until I sign that damn paper Dae'lin.  I have neither agree nor denied your request."

Dae'lin's anger rose, "So you did sleep with her?"  The patterns around her rose higher and higher I could feel the temperature rise, I could almost see the fire burning around her.

I wrapped Dae'lin in water and watched her spit and sputter at me.  "It is none of your business whether or not I slept with her."  I walked into the testing room where Dorian and Kai were trying to ignore our arguement.

Dae'lin opened the door still dripping wet, "That was uncalled for!"

I turned around and saw the damage the water had done, her shirt was plastered to her body and showed off every curve.  I smiled at her and she ignored my looking at her.  "You need to do this Nox."

I laughed, "I don't **need** to do anything with you.  You are the best genetic match to creating a Cesari.  You are nothing more than an incubator for the Venatori.  We do their bidding why?  I can find someone I actually like Dae'lin."

She huffed and air wrapped me up and threw me against the wall.  I could feel the panic trying to rise, the sense of self preservation leeching from my body but I grinned at Dae'lin.  "Keep it up Dae'lin or you'll be moved to the back of the line.  I do not **need** to sleep with you, or procreate with you.  You need me, not the other way around.  My life is fine just the way it is."

Dorian stood up and walked in front of Dae'lin.  "We got this, why don't you go find something dry to wear."

Dae'lin glared at him and let the patterns of air drop that were holding me to the wall.  She left saying, "Ever the diplomat, aren't you Dorian?"

He didn't say anything only indicate that I take a chair.  I looked at the brown package on the table.  Kai was standing in a corner, as far from the package as he could get yet still be in the room.  Dorian sat next to me hunched over looking.

I smiled, it was good to be trusted.  I wove a ball of air around the package.  "Do we have any data on the one that your experts blew up?"  I looked up at Kai.

He shrugged, Dorian pushed the papers towards me.  He nodded.  I smiled, "Can you tell me the blast radius?"  I knew Dorian would know the stats I wanted without having to rummage through the report.

Kai hurmphed in the corner and I just continued to look at Dorian while he did the search in his photographic memory.  To have that would be nice and such a pain in the ass.  

Dorian grabbed the paperwork and flipped to a page and set the report back down so I could read at my leisure.  "About 6 feet in diameter."

"So 3 feet radius?"  Dorian gave me a lopsided grin, "Look at the picture I drew."

"Okay."  I looked at the page Dorian had flipped over and saw why he'd been hesitant to give me a complete answer.  "A focus'd blast.  That's impressive."  I started making adjustments to my shield and looked up at my father standing in the corner.  "Can you come on this side, please?  I would rather exert the forces needed in a smaller scale than around the whole thing."

Kai asked, "What are you doing?"  But he moved as I'd asked and pulled up a chair on the other side of me.  

"Keeping us from blowing up right now.  Making a shield of air and earth that should keep the blast contained."  If it blew up in the same general direction all around it would have been easier, but I didn't know which way the focus would be.  And I didn't want to examine too close before having adequate protection.

I took a deep breath and looked past the shield in order to see the patterns around the box.  "You don't know who delivered the box."  

It wasn't a question but Kai answered anyway, "That's correct.  We dusted for finger prints but found none."

"And you didn't try to open it so that's good."  I commented without thinking about how Kai might take it.

Dorian interjected before Kai could get angry, "Your father is a smart man.  He wouldn't step in the viper pit if he knew it was there."

I grinned, "The vipers would probably just run away anyway."

Kai gave a curt laugh and I could see the smile on his face.  Dorian chuckled softly then prompted me, "What do you see?"

"All kinds of weird shit.  The patterns shouldn't eminate from a box like this.  Bomb or no bomb.  It's like water, it's moving.  Stable patterns don't move.  Unless it's meant to, this isn't meant to.  It's almost like the person can't see the pattern.  The structure is missing, but the peices are all here.  Kinda like geletain without a mold.  What do you see, oh master of patterns?"  I turned to wink at Dorian.

Dorian shook his head.  "I'm not a master of patterns.  I can see each element.  I see complexities I've never seen.  I don't see the movment you suggest though."

"Look a little harder and you'll see it.  Think like a magnifying glass in your head.  Zoom in to see greater detail."

Dorian looked at me with his head tilted to the side, like a puppy does when it can't understand what you are doing.  It was endearing.  He shook his head to clear his own thoughts and turned to look at the pattern, I watched Dorian.  We sat in silence, I glanced at Kai, he seemed to be trying as well.  I turned and saw the recognition on Dorian's face before he exclaimed, 'Holy. Mother...."

I laughed, "See told ya."

"I'm going to start poking at the bomb, do you want to be in here?"

Dorian pulled the chair closer and I smiled, "Suit yourself."  

I looked to my father he shrugged, "I'm already here."

The patterns were everywhere, I poked at it with air.  It was maleable yet resistant to my pushing.  The patterns weren't going to unravel at the faintest touch, that was good.  I'd have hated to have it blow up in my face.

Dorian spoke in his instructor voice, I wondered if he did it on purpose, "Tell me what you are doing or tyring to do."

"I'm trying to see if there are any pressure points on the box itself.  Opening it clearly is a trigger, just wondering if there is something more.  I'm watching how the patterns react as I poke them in different places in the pattern.  Seeing if it'll unravel."

I turned to look at my father, he was intently watching but he looked bewildered, "What do you see?"

"I see only what I can manipulate."

I nodded, "Earth and Fire, right?"  It didn't matter what Kai answered I knew the answer already, I contuned. "Water is hard to see.  Think in colors.  Red for fire, brown for earth.  Blue is water, Green or yellow can be air.  Try looking for the other colors."

I started drawing with fire the patterns Kai couldn't see of water and air.  "This is vaguely what the air pattern looks like."

Kai sat back in his chair astonishment written alover his face.  "How do you get past the bubble of air?  Now that I can see air that's all I see."

I grinned but Dorian was the one to answer.  "It just takes practice.  Focus past it, like you are taking a picture of something just the other side of it."

I watched my father as he tried, I could see the sweat beading on his forehead and the concentration in his eyes.  He sat back in his chair with a look of defeat.   "It's alright, that's pretty good for your first time seeing air."  I smiled at him reassuring, it would have been a lot harder.

I went back to the box and traced the patterns with fire, mostly for Kai but it helped me put things in perspective.  I talked my way through how the peices fell together, how one connected to another, how it was unstable.  I didn't want to pull at the pattern.  So I started enhancing it, stabalizing it.  I wanted to see what it would look like without the weaknesses it had.

We sat in near silence for the better part of an hour where I puzzled through the pattern.  I smiled at the masterpeice.  It really was beautiful.  The completed patterns together to form this explosive peice of work.  I pulled at very specific points in the patterns and the patterns disappainted into nothingness.  Completely gone and unharmed.

Kai stood up and I dropped my shield and he opened the box slowly almost like he didn't trust me.  I wouldn't trust me either if I were him.  Inside the boxs there as a typed message  "Boom!  I hope your family liked my little surprise -A"

No one touched the paper.  Maybe there would be some information to be found inside the box.  Things that should have been destroyed.  Kai smiled, "Forensics will take care of this now."

I nodded, "Alright.  I'm going to go look for connections.  I have some thoughts."  I'd felt better than I had when I came in.  Working had been good.  I left Dorian and Kai chatting about their next move, mostly forensic stuff.  Stuff I couldn't be helpful with, so I left with a nod to my father and I brushed my fingers against the back of Dorian's hand.  He smiled and nodded farewell as he continued his conversation with Kai.  I felt better definitely.
