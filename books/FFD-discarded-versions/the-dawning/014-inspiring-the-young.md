# Inspiring the Young
_Monday, June 15, 2015 11:30AM_

I left ICU with only minimal issues.  The nurses whispered behind my back, some even right in front of me.  I flashed them a smile and some looked away embarrassed others blushed.  It was obvious which were gossiping and those that were admiring.  I got more of the embarrassed looks than not Kai must have been having words with them.  I felt for any of them who might get their ears burned when he returns to find I'd seen his son.

I started down the stairs and as I rounded the corner of the first flight I ran into a near immovable object.  I looked down and saw the raven hair and bright blue eyes shining up at me with a wide smile.  "I was just coming to warn you." Dorian said as I took a step back.

I raised an eyebrow and he continued, "My mother informed me you were visiting Nicholas, and I just saw Kai enter the building."

Grinning at the man before me, "Thanks for the warning, had a good talk with Nick."

Dorian frowned, "Sounds like you are familiar with Nicholas?"

I laughed, how had the photographic memory of Dorian Vega forgotten a fact.  I grinned mishieveously at him, "We were lab partners once upon a time.  I'm sure you remember that."

It was only moments as Dorian parsed his memory,and then nodded, "Chemistry?"

I smiled, "And a little biology, or was it health education."

Dorian smirked to cover the blush that was forming at the base of his neck, "Ah yes.  The boy Dae'lin caught you in the halls kissing."

I nodded.  "I wish someone would have told me then he was my half-brother.  It makes so much sense now.  Why Dae'lin didn't want me cozzying up to him.  I beleive the threat was 'You ever see that boy in anything other than school work and I'll not only have your hide, I'll hang it from my office wall.'"

Dorian chuckled, "That sounds like Dae'lin."  He sighed, "It was of less concern that you and Nicholas be more friends than you and your father know of each others existance.  I beleive you and Nick were an experiment of sorts.  To see how the same blood could be affected by the nurture."

I rolled my eyes.  "Another lovely experiment I am part of.  I am thankful now that Dae'lin caught us though.  Nick and I were going places fast that day.  Seeing him again brought those feelings back up and I had to squash them because they are nothing now.  He's my brother."

Dorian nodded, there was sympathy in his eyes.  He smiled and changed the subject, "I have a favor to ask of you."

"Shoot."

"I have a new Magnus.  He's rather ... difficult to say the least.  His third mentor resigned from his service today citing irrevocable differences.  He's a good kid - rather he could be a good kid.  I know it."

There was little hesitation in my answer, if Dorian beleived the kid redeemable he was.  Dorian was a good judge of character, he always had been.  I had always trusted his judgement, there was no reason to doubt him now.

Dorian continued, "Since you are here for an indeterminate amount of time I'd like you to try to mentor him.  If we cannot get him to learn about his gift, there is only one choice left.  And I do not like the idea of turning his potential into a Tacet."

"That bad?"  To be tacet was unthinkable.  I'd only met a handful of them in my short life.  They were empty souls with little to live for.  But it was what happened if you couldn't control your magic.  "You think I can have any impact?"

Dorian nodded, "You are more like him than the others.  Outcasts.  He's sixteen, Nox.  He was found on the streets, his parents dead.  A house fire they didn't escape from.  Likely he set it by accident when he came into his powers."  Dorian frowned, "He has no one.  Maybe you and he can get along, even if you can't teach him, he might listen to you."

"Yeah, sure," I nodded, "When?"  Dorian grinned and I knew exactly what he wanted, right now.  I laughed, "Now, it is then."

We started down the stairs together.  The silence was nice, it wasn't uncomfortable, my hand itched to hold his, but I kept my hands to myself.  I glanced at him from the corner of my eye and kept wondering why I was feeling like a teenager around him.  

Dorian took the next door way into what became the academy proper.  I thought fondly on the times I'd followed Dorian here, today though was different.  We walked as equals, or at least collegues.  I commented on it, "This is different."

Dorian asked, "How so?"  But he glanced at me with a knowing smile, he felt the difference too.  There was so much hope building inside me at that one glance.

"The last time we walked this way," I smiled, "I followed you a decrete distance behind you."  I needed to change the subject, "Tell me of the kid you are taking me to."  Might as well get the down and dirty details from the source instead of having to read them.  We walked and I fought the urge to steal looks at this man who was ravaging my hormones.

"He was brought in from the streets a few months ago.  He was starved and dehydrated and was not in any shape what-so-ever to do much of anything.  We fed him and gave him a safety zone.  A hunter found him in a homeless shelter starting fires with the snap of his fingers."

"Untrained in fire, but he has control.  That's unusual.  He's sixteen?"  I was skeptical.

Dorian nodded, "Yes, he's 16."

I laughed, "Sixteen and just now being found!"  It was very hard to believe. "Someone had to find him.  No one is that talented.  Particularly fire-starters."

Dorian agreed, "Yes, but he won't tell us any names.  He is hardly forth coming at all.  Every mentor we've put him under has complained and he's ended up back in my care.  You are the last one.  I've already told you the consequences of his failure to listen to you.  We've tried everything. Maybe someone closer in age will help him."

I nodded, "What have the others done?"

"He's working on his GED online.  He's too far behind to stick in classes his own age for schooling and if we'd stick him where he needs to be he'd be even more out of place.  He's restricted to his quarters when not with his mentor or in the lab because he's just a terror on everyone."  Dorian sighed.

"Put him in classes.  I don't care what.  Art, Music, PE with kids his age.  Stick him in Jason's class, he's supposedly working some new angle. Dae'lin's got a few advanced kids she's tutoring in multiple elements, put him in there too.   I'll watch him in them until he's behaving if I have to.  You can't isolate a kid and expect him to behave like he understand social interactions.  As a matter of fact, stick him in all of Jason's classes.  The younger the better.  If he's multi-talented and you think he could be Cesari too well then he can inspire them, help them too."

Dorian laughed, "You take the opposite approach to everyone.  I will create a schedule that he can start after we get you on a real schedule here.  But... how did you guess my speculation of the boy?"

I smiled, "Why else would you choose me as your last attempted instead of the last person.  You didn't know I was coming to town."

Dorian opened a testing room door with a smile.  Dorian let me go in first and closed the door behind him.  "Levi, this is Nox.  He is going to be your new mentor.  Remember lad, what we discussed."  He started in on the Tacet lecture again as I took in the boy.

The boy was slumped in the chair, one leg over the arm the opposite arm hanging over the other arm like he'd been plopped in the chair without any bones.  He hid his face beneath a baseball cap sporting the Sox logo like Aaron's earlier.  He reminded me of a puppet from the marionette show I'd seen as a young child.  Something to entertain the kids he didn't remember much else of it.  I wondered if I could pull the strings like the puppet and make him dance.  The thought made me smile and I could have sworn the boy sneered at me.  He didn't smell like a fire-starter, they almost always smelled like smoke.  Fire wasn't his base element.  

But as I returned to Dorian's calm patient tone, I realized he was sneering at the information Dorian was retelling. I smiled and interrupted Dorian, "I got this."

Dorian chuckled, "As you wish."  Dorian left the room, but I knew he'd go to the other side of the two way mirror to watch us.  It was his job to assess first meetings, and every other meeting afterwards, though he didn't follow every single child that walked through the doors.

I pulled a chair back and tipped it on its back to legs and wrapped air around it before sitting down.  I did it to see what Levi would do.  A show of power, a sort of bragging, but more importantly to see if he even noticed that my chair had stood up before I sat down.  I smiled at him, "So, Levi..."

He glanced at me then down under the table and then he stood up.  He walked around the table and squatted down to examine the chair, "How are you doing that?"

"You can't see it?" I inquired.  Levi shook his head.  "Look for the pattern holding the chair steady.  You can manipulate air, Dorian says he tested you."

Levi took his hat off and cliped it to his belt loop then ran his fingers through his dark hair.  "I just blew a bubble."

I grinned at his modesty, he sounded a lot like me, like it was nothing big.  And for him it probably was nothing.  "With your mind, inside a box.  Come on, think how would you do that if you could see air?"

I got out of Levi's way, I stood up and the chair remained standing on its back two legs.  I added some earth to the air so it would become a cloud instead of transparent.  "The earth should give it visibility to anyone.  Look for the pattern."  I sat down next to Levi on the floor and crossed my legs, "Every pattern is unique, everyone and everything has a different pattern."  

I waited for a little while before I prompted a bit more information to help Levi look for the pattern.  "Think of the patterns like lattice work.  You know those fake looking things up the sides of suburban houses that have vines and roses and other climbing plants on them.  But each object and each element create different lattices."

I sighed as I remembered my schooling.  "I could go on about chemical bonds or crystalline structures but I don't think that would help you at all.  And I'd sound too much like Dae'lin for my preference."

Levi started poking the patterns with his finger.  He asked, "Who's Dae'lin?  Your girlfriend or something?"

A sharp laugh escaped my lips before I could catch it and it made Levi jump.  I appologized, "Sorry.  Dae'lin was my mentor.  She is now my boss.  She insisted I maintain an A average in everything.  Which meant I spent most of my free time with my nose in a book, or on the computer to try to understand things that were just beyond me."

"Sounds like torture."  Levi continued to stare at the cloud of dirt and air but he didn't seeme to be getting any closer.

"It was at times.  But I had an hour every day to goof off, Jace made sure I used it wisely."

"Your boyfriend?"

I laughed, "What have you heard about me?"

The boy turned around and looked at me.  "Nothing.  It's just the way you talk about them.  I remember my parents talking that way about each other."

I nodded, "Jace is my best friend.  We've never been anything more.  He's the only true family I've had since I was five.  Dae'lin was my mentor, nothing more.  I respect her."  I sighed, the talk of family made him pull back, I could see it in his eyes as he turned back to work on the patterns before him.  "I'm sorry about losing your parents.  I know it's not easy."

Levi's voice sounded like the weight of the world just pressed down upon him.  He snapped, "What you know about it?"

"I wasn't as young as you when I lost my mother.  But she sent me away when I was 5 years old.  I never saw her again until I was 18.  So she might as well have already been gone."  Nox sighed, "On one of my first hunts after graduation.  I went back home, to my mother's home.  She needed help with a rogue were-bear.  It was terrorizing the community and humans alike.  It needed to be stopped but bullets weren't helping so they needed something a little more powerful."

Levi turned to face me again, he was at least still listening to me ramble about myself. "She and I went out to its lair.  It attacked, she'd insisted on going first, the veteran Venatori and all that jazz.  She took a swipe to the stomach and chest area, disemboweling her.  I managed to get a fireball off before it raked me and left me with a nice scar on my chest.  But it was dead.  I would live if I could get to help, but I was unable to save my mother.  If I'd insisted on going first I could have prevented the mess.  I'd have had shields and the like, but my mother was stubborn.  She'd told me, none of that magic stuff.  It was my magic that saved me and why I'd been called in.  But she was old school."

Levi went back to looking at the pattern, "She was stupid.  No offense."

I nodded, "None taken, I agree with you."

I could hear the curiousity in his voice as he asked, "What about your dad?"

I sighed.  "I didn't know my dad, still technically I don't.  I mean I now know who he is, but to me he's just some man who hates me.  He can join the club of haters.  I don't really care."  It was time to get back to the task at hand.  "Tell me what you see Levi."  I could see that he was fustrated.  Patterns were important to see, you had to see them to use your potential.

The boy sighed, "I don't know."

I brought the chair down and released the patterns.  "Turn and face me, let's try this a little differently."
 
He was having difficulty with air lets try what he was stronger in.  "What is your strongest element?" I asked, hoping it wasn't water.

Levi replied flatly, "Water."

I shook my head, "Of course, it would be my weakest."  I paused a moment and gathered my strength, water alone always gave me fits, it moved so irratically and defied my will.  "Alrighty.  There is water all around us, it's in the air, in our bodies.  You are a four?"  I asked, but I already knew the answer.  I could tell from the patterns around him.  I'd learned to read a person's skill set and level without the need of a test.  I always found it odd that no one else did, except maybe Dorian.  "You can replicate water if it's there."

Levi nodded, "That's what I've been told."  I hadn't needed the confirmation but I was glad for the validation.  I tried to figure out the easiest way to show him the patterns when the door behind me opened, and Dorian handed me a bottle of water.  I looked up at him with a beaming smile, "You read my mind."

Dorian smiled back, "I'll find the rest of the materials for you and bring you them so you can work with them."

I nodded and Dorian shut the door and we went back to work.  "Water is slippery.  It moves and shiftes, it moves like you'd imagine water would.  The pattern is constantly shifting.  It is the hardest element to manipulate and the odd man out.  I'm guessing you learned to control water first.  Which is also probably why you aren't seeing the simplier patterns."  

I smiled as I poured a small amount of water in my hand.  "Focus on the water."  I shifted the water around by bending and twisting its pattern.  I could see the small elements of life sparkling inside of it.  It always looked like diamonfs when I focused too hard.  "Try to watch the patterns shift.  You need to look deep down inside it.  It's like using a microscope."  That was an idea.  I'd have to visit the labs and see if that would be helpful later, if he didn't get it now.

Levi was unsure of himself as he spoke quietly with his hand in front of his mouth, "I think I see something, but I don' tknow."

I nodded.  "Hold out your hand."  I poured a small amount of water in his hand, "Try to reproduce the pattern I'm showing you.  Exactly like mine is."

I watched Levi shift the patterns, but he wasn't shifting the patterns, he was pushing the water around and pulling it in other places.  It was close but I could see the small intricasies of the pattern that weren't there.  "Nice try."  I pointed to various places that were wrong and Levi toss the water at me.  I smiled.  "It's hard when you can just do it.  But if you want to progress father, and do more amazing things, you need to see the patterns."

"You started a fire accidentally?"  It was more a rhetorical question as I was fairly sure that was why his house had burnt down with his parents inside.

Levi got up and kicked the chair across the room, "Yeah.  Thanks for the reminder."

I put my arms behind me and leaned back on my hands, "Hey, it's okay.  I was a fire-starter too.  It's why my mother sent me away."  I sighed, and sat up as Levi turned to look at me, "She beleives that children shouldn't be treated any different than a rouge Magnus.  When a supernatural is dangerous, they are dangerous, it doesn't matter if the creature is your own son or not."  The memories flooded in and I closed my eyes to rid them from my minds eye, "She sent me away so I didn't have to make her feel conflicted."  I opened my eyes and smiled, "So I understand.  Really."

I pulled my lighter out of my pocket.  I always carried it with me in case of emergency.  Fire was my go to element and sometimes you are just too tired to create it from nothing, a lighter helps with that.  "Watch me."  I held the lighter up and flipped it on and took the flame from the receptical and it floated above my hand.

I changed the flickering flame to a hollow ball of fire and air.  The air kept the shape, I could do it with fire alone but the fire would die out eventually as I instructed.  "Try."

I held the lighter out to Levi with a tiny flame flickering above it.  Levi deftly took the flame and started trying.  He was manipulating both air and fire at the same time but he wasn't using the patterns.  He couldn't see the patterns.  We'd have to find another way.

I smiled, "That's enough for now.  We need to break you of your old habits.  You'll get there eventually.  I can see the potential in you.  There are not many Cesari, and it's very likely that is why your other mentors failed to help you.  They don't understand the differences.

Levi asked, "What's Cesari?"

"A cesari is a magnus who can bend all four elements at the same time.  It's a rare gift, and you are one.  Dorian suspected it and he was right.  I can see it."

A tinny voice over the intercom interrupted us, "How do you know that Nox?"

I looked towards the two way mirror and smiled, "The way the pattern around him moves.  It's different than say Dae'lin's.  Everyone's is different, we vibrate on different frequencies, but all Cesari I've ever met the patterns all flow toward them.  It's a magnetic like attraction to all elements.  A water bender attracts water and repeal everything else.  Those like Dae'lin who can bend all four, they oscillate between things.  Dae'lin attracts air much easier than fire, but the patterns shift in a pattern of osculation.  I'm sure there is a mathematical equation that could tell you but I'm not that interested in that.  But you can see the differences if you pay attention.  The differences are small but I made a habit of studying patterns the day you showed me them."

Dorian chuckled over the intercom.  I couldn't even begin to imagine all the theories running through his head about this new peice of information.

I stood up shaking my hands, "Come on Levi.  I have a class I want to take you to. It'll be a bunch of little kids, but I would like you to listen to the class.  Jace claims to have a new way of thinking about things, maybe he'll help you out too."

I opened the door to the testing room and found Dae'lin leaning agains the opposite wall.  She smiled her angry smile at me.  I gave her my best smart ass grin.  She shook her head, "You didn't tell me you saw patterns that way."

I shrugged, "You never asked me."

She sounded miffed, "Did you tell Dorian or Jason?"

I shook my head.  "Dorian never asked either and Jace knew I saw things differently and he started playing with it but we never spoke on it to any great length."

Dae'lin nodded, "We need to sit down, the four of us, and discuss this.  You need to show us how, so we can teach others.  Unless you want to.  This is new Nox.  If what you say is true, then we can elimnate so many problems with classification.  There has never been a Cesari like you.   Everyone else wants to only create things, ultimately trying to be gods."

I was surprised when Levi asked, "We can be like God?"

I shook my head, "No.  Some Magnus think we can be.  They've mastered the art of creating cadavers or other living objects that resemeble them but they don't actually live.  We can't even use the creations for transplants, they just don't have that spark of life.  It would be like Frankenstein all over again."

Levi was incredulous, "That was real?"

I laughed and I heard a soft giggle from Dae'liln.  "Nah man.  Just an analogy.  Come on we'll be late.  And late gets us in trouble."  I winked at Dae'lin as we started for the classrooms thinking about the spark of life between the patterns particularly in water.  Maybe there was a way to harness it, but the world was probably better off with out that experiment.

Levi followed me up to Jace's class, he never complained about taking the stairs even after we passed the elevator.  I was grateful for that.  I opened up the door to Jace's class room and he looked up from his desk, they were quietly watching some pattern play out on the screen before them.  Technology couldn't capture it, but some ingenious person had found a way to mimic pattern manipulation on the screen.  I watched as Levi stared at the screen and I saw it click.

Jason beamed at me and stood up behind his desk and turned the digital patterns off, "Everyone, I'd like you to meet my best friend.  He's going to show us all something very special today.   We are going to go up to the roof top and watch Nox skyjump.  He has a new protege, and he'll be spending some time with us today and in the future.  So let's make Mr. Hughes feel welcome."  And once again the rumors moved faster than I did.

Levi laughed, "I'm Mr. Hugues and he's just Nox?  I see how I rate."

Jace grinned, "Have you ever called Nox, Mr. Sétanta?  I don't recomend you try.  But everyone in my class goes by Mister or Miss."

I leaned over to Levi and whispered loudly."That's the southern gentleman in him."  I grinned playfully at Jace and opened the door.  Beckoning the class to follow, "Let's go up to the roof.  There are a few rules you must all follow the moment you step foot on the roof."

The small class of five and six year olds lined up and followed me out the door.  Levi took up the rear and Jason followed him. I started in on my standard newb jumping rules,  "I am the boss.  What I say is law. If I say freeze I mean immediately.  If I say move you do it.  No one goes near the edge without being on the harness.  There is only Jason at the top and he's going to be busy.  Levi might be able to save you, but he's never seen this.  So harness before you get near the edge, or you will never make that roof again.  Ever!  And the last rule, you do not do this ever without me.  Never.  I don't care what you think you know or what your friends think they know.  I find you on the roof without me, you will NEVER do this again."  I pointedly looked at Levi, "That means you too."

I stopped at the last door and turned towards their eager faces, "Do we all understand?"  Everyone nodded heir heads, even though Levi's was reluctant.

As I opened the door Jace started in on his own little lesson, "Skyjumping is something Nox created to get over his fear of heights and falling.  We eventually got here, and the first hundred times or so we glided to the bottom.  Today, Nox is going to show you what inspired me and why I'm now teaching this class."

Jace set up the veil around the alley as I continued, "Mr. Hill is setting up a default canvas so that no one outside the alley sees what is happening.  So no one sees a falling person and calls the cops.  That's kinda awkward."

Jason was finished and turned back to his class. "The belts are over here, start strapping them in, Mr. Hughes, Nox and I will help you secure yourself before you clamp on to the line."

Everyone start grabbing harnesses and the chatter started.  I stood before the only girl in the class, "Hi, what's your name?"  

I started wrapping the straps around her as she smiled up at me, "Elena."

I grinned, "Like the Vampire Diaries, very nice."  I gave her an mock appalled look, "You don't drink blood do you?"

She giggled, "No sir."  I finished tightening her belts and she moved on to the line.  I moved to Levi who was helping a little boy.  I knelt down before him and smiled, "What's your name?"

He whispered shyly.  "Charles."

"We have our own Professor X."

The boy frowned, he didn't catch my reference.  Levi was shaking his head.

All the kids were strapped in and attached to the safety line. It was time to conquer my fear again.  Like I did each and every time I jumped from the building.  Heights, whodathunk that was my greatest physical fear.  I had others, but this, this one I could conquer.  And I did.

I stepped up on the ledge and peired over the edge and felt the fear run up my spine.  I swallowed hard and turned around.  It was always easier not watching the ground gain speed towards my face.  Watching the sky fall away was so much easier.

I wrapped all the elements around me.  Fire and water were only there for show, this was all about the show, not the actual jump itself.  I had free reign to show off.  I heard the kids ooh and ahh as I fell backwards and wings of air slowed my decent.  I could float like a feather to the ground if I so chose, but I liked the free fall, the air rushing past my ears.  It was 8 seconds.  8 seconds of pure bliss - it was almost heaven.

The ground caught me in a softened cradle of my own devising.  I knew exactly when and how to do it, I didn't need to see it.  If gravity were to one day change on me I was going to become a pancake.  But the chances of that happening was slight.  

I lay on the ground for several moments looking up at the blue hazy sky of New York City.  It wasn't nearly as pretty as something in the mountains, but it was home.  I felt more at ease here than I did in the great outdoors.  I was pretty sure I was going to ask to stay, even if that meant I had to teach.  But there was always hunts in the City, in every city.

I sat up and eventually pulled myself to standing and started for the alley way that held the entrance back inside.  As I turned the corner I found the door open and a familiar face was waiting as he propped the door open with his body.  I grinned, "Hey."

He smiled, "Hey back.  You enjoy that?"

I nodded emphatically as I stopped in front of Dorian, "It's almost heaven."

Dorian grinned, "Almost heaven?  If that's not heaven, what is?"

I chuckled, "I'm sure I could show you sometime."  I winked suggestively and I watched a small hint of color wash up on the bronzed skin of the man before me.

Dorian waved me inside and I stepped inside and turned back to face him as the door closed behind him.  "I need to get back up there."  I nodded towards the roof.

Dorian closed the distance between us.  He hesitated a moment before he put his hand on my arm.  I could feel my heart flutter as he touched me.  He smiled and I felt home, more home than I had in ages.  "I'd really like to talk with you about patterns."  Why touch me for that?  Was he flirting?  Damn I wished I could read past my own self right now.

I nodded my words failing me.  I swallowed and put on my innocent grin, "Alright.  Whenever is convenient for you.  I've got a billion and one things to do, but no specific order they have to be done in."

Dorian nodded, "Later tonight?  I have a dinner with a new employee and then I'm free."

I took a deep breath as I nodded, Dorian smiled at me with that knowing smile.  I spoke slowly, "Sounds good.  Stop by my room.  I should be there.  We can find someplace quiet to talk I'm sure."

Dorian smiled and pulled his hand away brushing along my arm as he headed up the stairs.  I was reading too much into this.  I had to be.  I watched as Dorian headed up the stairs.  My heart was still pounding and I wasn't sure if it was due to the jump or from Dorian's touch, either way, I was enjoying the way Dorian made me feel.  Though I knew it was a dangerous game to play.  I had to push the thoughts away.  Why would he be interested?

I took the stairs up two at a time until I grew tired.  I made it about half way up.  It wasn't that I was out of shape but it was a long way up.  

I opened the door to the roof and I could hear the chatter of the children as Jace was trying to get things settled.  I heart Charles explaim, "He bent all four elements at the same time."

The moment one of them noticed me they all ran towards me and started chattering away at me with such enthusiasm it was hard not to get swept up in it.  But I couldn't hear half of what they said.  It was a din of chaos, but it was so full of hope and Jace took it upon himself to calm things down, "Leave the man be," he laughed.  "Come on let's go back to class and discuss what we saw calmly."

They all got in their neat little line all still looking at me with wide eyes and I knew then that I wanted to do that again. Wanted to share what I had to offer.  Jace clapped me on the back, "Good job man.  Inspiration done.  Thanks a lot bro."

I smiled widely at Jace, "No problem. Anytime."

Jace lead the group downstairs and Levi looked at me expectantly, I grinned at him, "Go ahead.  I'll catch up on some work.  Stay with Jace.  I'll come get you later."  He nodded and headed after the younger class.  Maybe he'd do well with them.  Maybe it would straighten him out.  I could only hope so.
