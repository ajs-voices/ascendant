Narrowing down the exact location hadn't been hard once I had a place a general idea of what I was looking for.  It was still early; there was barely enough light to see by but I packed up camp anyway.  I had every intention of going home once this was all said and done.  Home being a relative term - back to where I was staying - to a real bed - that was my goal.

The roads were narrow and had steep inclines and declines on both sides.  They were cracked and gravel strewn across them like someone had just dumped buckets of grit and grim on them.  The Jeep was a great vehicle for driving on these roads.  The four wheel drive came in handy, but even that didn't make me feel any better as I navigated the near ledges that these mountains called roads.

I could feel my heart racing as I drove carefully along the crooked roads of Apache Peak as I neared the closest location to where Naomi could be hiding.  I was careful not to look over the edge too often as I drove past a particularly narrow turn.  

By the time I had reached the closest possible point the road could take me my anxiety was through the roof.  My heart was racing.  I was probably ash white and covered in sweat.  Heights were not my favorite and after the night I had I was more than ready to walk through the woods for a while.

The forest was normally full of woodland sounds, but this dreary morning there was not a chirp of an insect or even the ruffling of leaves as a critter would pass by - nothing was making a sound.  

I could feel the adrenaline rising with each step - the quiet only made things more eerie.  I was not only stalking my pray, I knew she was stalking me.  It was a game of hide-and-seek and we were both 'it'.  

My phone started singing happily along as it rang in my pocket.  

I jumped.  I hadn't been expecting anyone to call me and I'd forgotten to put my phone on silent.  I struggled to untangle it quickly from my pocket to silence the obnoxious noise that felt louder than it really was.  I swiped my thumb across the answer button and was putting it to my ear when I saw a blur of motion.

I started to say, "What do you want, Dae'lin?  I'm kinda busy at the moment."  But I barely got any of it out as sharp claws dug into my shoulders and legs and I flew backwards.  I landed on my back with a small black and gold dragon perched on top of my body. She started to open her mouth.

I could feel my body tense as I prepared for the inevitable volcano of flames while at the same time I wove a pattern of air so strong that she was flung from my body in one horrifing gush of air.  I could feel her talons ripping through my flesh as she launched herself into the sky.

I lay staring up at the trees above me where the dragon had once been trying to catch my breath.  I could feel my wounds knitting together.  It was a feeling I hated almost as much as getting hurt.  I heard in the quiet of the forest a tinny voice yelling my name, "Nox!"  I couldn't help but roll my eyes.  Dae'lin had to call right then.  I sighed as I rolled over.  The blood was making my clothes stick to my body and would soon hardern and make things even worse of a mess.  I could still hear Dae'lin's voice calling my name.  I hoped she kept it up as long as the line stayed opened.  

I searched where I had fallen but couldn't find my phone.  I had to draw on my extended hearing to locate the pile of leaves my phone had fallen into.  I collapsed against a tree and dusted off my phone before putting it to my ear.  "I'm here."

I could hear the small brunette's anger and her concern as she vaulted into yelling at me.  "What the hell was that, Nox?  What happened?  Are you okay?"

I smiled to myself, Dae'lin would forever and always be my mentor before she was my boss.  "I'm fine.  I'm close to the end game here, what do you want?"

Dae'lin harrumphed over the line and I could almost see the fury on her face as she laid into me.  "Never do that again!  I didn't know what had happened."

I rolled my eyes.  "Dae'lin it's part of the job.  You know this.  You called in the middle of a hunt.  What did you expect?"

The small sigh from the other end of the phone made me a little anxious, she really had been worried for my safety and I was not exactly playing nice.  I apologized, "Sorry, I worried you.  I'm fine, nothing a little R n R won't heal.  You didn't call to chat, what did you need?  I need to finish this hunt before she gets away."

"You'll have to leave it Nox.  Come home.  We need your talents here."  I could hear the command in her voice, she was no longer my mentor or caretaker, she was my boss now.  

I sighed.  "I'm almost done."

Dae'lin's voice rose to her angry pitch.  "Now, Nox.  We need you now!  I expect you here at tomorrow morning's briefing."  There was a small pause before Dae'lin included, "And that's an order, Nox."  She hung up the phone without my consent to come.  She knew I had no real choice in the matter.  

But I was so close.  I leaned against the tree while the wounds finished healing  and I thought about exactly what I was going to do.  This wasn't a dangerous dragon - not really.  She was robbing banks and got caught.  But it was my job to take her down.  I had no intentions of killing her, but she didn't know this.  I wasn't exactly playing by typical Venatori standards.  

I used my phone to check out flight arrangements.  I still had to get to the Denver Airport - a 2 hour drive.  Briefings were usually around 9am.  The only non-stop flight was at midnight.  So I had several hours to kill.  I booked the flight.  I could still make the damn meeting and at least try to catch my dragon.  I felt better about that.

My new wounds were as healed as they were going to get.  Add some new scars to the running total.  I had to think up a fun story about that.  But that was for another time.  I pushed myself up from the ground and headed in the direction Naomi's dragon form had flown.  Thankfully it was the same direction I had been going before, my theory had been correct.

The noises of the forest didn't return as I'd hoped.  She still lurked in the shadows and I was still prey.  The sun was moving higher in the sky as each minute passed. 

I glanced at my phone which I now had on vibrate just in case Dae'lin decided to call me again to remind me.  She'd been known to do it before.  It was nearly two hours since she'd called and I was just not peering over the edge of a rise looking into the crag that I beleive to have Naomi's hoard.

A piercing wail came from inside.  It wasn't pain or fear, was just a squalling child.  All sorts of things ran though my mind, but Naomi hadn't been a bad woman... dragon.  She'd only been caught on camera doing impossible things while doing what dragons do - collecting things for her hoard.  

I doubted that inside the cave there would be mounds of gold coins or even gems, but I expected that she had a tiddy little sum stashed inside.  She'd robbed over two dozen banks that I could connect to her.  We would try her publicly as a human court - she'd been caught by human servalene it was protocol if they were caught.  Most Venatori didn't catch their marks.  It was shoot first, ask questions later.  I didn't work that way.  I'd hurt enough people in my life already I didn't need to do it to strangers too.  I only killed when necessary.  I hoped today wasn't necessary.

I crept into the cave, it was dark and smelled damp and mildewy.  It took me a moment to focus past the scents and peer into the darkness.  The entrance was narrow and I scrapped my arm and knees on a few outcroppings before the opening gave way to a large cavern inside.  The wail echoed inside the cavern again, my ears rang from the resonance.

I created a small ball of light above my head, it was a simple pattern, one every child magnus knew.  The yellow pool of light let me see enough to see a small child sitting mere yards from where I stood.  My light caught his attention and his cry cut short as he peered up at me.

The child had a much lighter version of Naomi's golden hair and the skin of soft alabaster.  I could see the faint red glow of hot embers peaking out from behind his shirt.  It pulsed with each pounding heart beat.  There was no form of dragon behind the toddler, but the patterns shimmered like nothing I had ever seen from anyone.  He lifted his nose in my direction and sniffed the air, much like a dog might do when trying to catch their prey's scent.  

The boy struggled to stand and I wanted to go to him but I didn't want to be distracted.  He toddled towards me and I let him come close but I watched the surrounding cavern with my back to the nearest wall.  I wasn't going to get jumped again.

He came to me and held up his arms with a soft whimper.  I smiled down at him, "Where are your parents?"

The boy stared up and me and urged me again to pick him up.  I reached down under the boy's arms and lifted him gently and settled him against my body.  He buried his face in the crook of my neck and shoulder and purred.  The boy was extremely warm to the touch.  

I heard a rock skid across the floor as a bullet flew wide of my location.  "Set the boy down," a voice echoed through the cavern.  

The boy curled closer to my body and squeezed his arms tighter around my neck.  "I don't think he wants me to do that.  Come out and we can talk about this."  I doubted he would listen to me, but the boy really didn't seem to want me to let him go.

A figured moved in the shadows in front of me.  I brightened the small floating light above me and I could see the cavern in its full glory.  It was filled with paintings along the wall, priceless statues and there were even a few small safes sitting precariously throughout the cavern.  She was more than a bank robber it seemed.  I asked, "Where is Naomi?"

The man shook his head like he was confused by what I said. "Let the boy go," he demanded.  He took aim with the pistol at me and the child.

I shook my head.  "You'd endanger your son like that?"  I pulled at the little boy but he clung to me like I was saving him.  I whispered to him.  "It'll be alright.  Nothing will hurt you.  I promise."  He looked up at me with those orange eyes and blinked sideways.  He let go and I set him down on the ground.  "Stay there."  I wove a shield of air around the boy, he wouldn't get hurt.  I promised him that and I meant it.  

I turned to the man who was tracking me with his pistol as I moved away from his son.  "Alright.  I put him down.  Now where is Naomi?"

The man continued to point the gun at me as he hurried towards the toddler.  He bounced off the shield of air and he looked at me with daggers in his eyes.  I released the pattern.  "I was only protecting the child from any stray bullets.  You can reach him now."

He tried to go towards the boy again and this time didn't find my barrier in place.  The boy didn't reach for his father but let him pick him up.  "Where is Naomi?" I asked again.  I was getting impatient.

"Not here.  And why would I tell a Ventori where she is?  You are just going to kill her anyway."

I sighed. "No.  She'll go in for a trial.  I don't kill my marks unless they try to kill me first."

He laughed at me.  "Yeah right.  I don't believe you.  Naomi says all you do is kill her kind."

I nodded, "Most of us do.  But I don't."  I could go into details but I doubt he'd listen nor care what I had to say about the Venatori way.  "Where is she?  You can't show off your abilities and not be punished.  I'm only here because she revealed herself to humans.  We can't have that."

He wrapped himself around the boy.  "If you take her away, who will protect us?"  He sounded lost and sad. 

"Protect you from whom?"  I wasn't sure why they would need protection.

"From other dragons."  He said it like it was the only obvious answer.  

"Why do..."  I didn't finish my sentence as dragon lore 101 came into my head.  Dragons kill their hybrid offspring.  "He's half human?"  _Duh!_

He nodded his head.  "I'll make sure no one hurts the boy.  But I need to take you and Naomi in."

He frowned and turned to run away with the boy in his arms.  I quickly made a barrier of air around him and the child and shook my head.  "Sorry.  You are staying right there.  I'll be back once I get Naomi."

I left the cavern to the sounds of the man screaming for me to let him go.  No one would harm him or the boy as long as I lived.  The shield keeping him in, would keep anyone out.  

I still didn't know where Naomi was, but she couldn't be far.  I called out, "Come on, Naomi, let's talk this out.  You got caught.  You know the rules."

I placed a barrier of air on the cavern door.  She wouldn't get in and no one would get out.  I wished I could just enclose a net around the area and confine her, but I didn't know where she was.  And I didn't think on as little sleep I had I'd manage that much power without passing out.  I knew my limits.

I took a few steps away from the cavern and a not so human voice called out from someplace in front of me, "You smell like Drake.  Why?"

"Drake?"  I asked confused.  Her son?  "The boy?"

Out of the sky she swooped down and knocked me over before taking flight again.  She'd learned one lesson anyway.  "He's fine, with his father."

She flew at my fallen form on the ground and I wove a net of air and wrapped her in it just as she was about to dig her talons into my body for a second time.  Her wings tangled with the filiments of air and she collapsed to the ground.  "Sorry Duckling.  But you aren't going to win like that."  I got up slowly and then knelt down by her dragon form head, "Your son is fine."

"They'll kill him." Even in dragon form I could tell she was sad.

I shook my head, "No, they won't.  I won't let them."  You don't fucking kill children!  You don't give them away, you don't treat them like nothing.

Naomi shifted to human, still inside my net of air.  

I watched in amazement as the bones shifted and the scales turned flesh.  I could see the shadow of her dragon form take shape and hide in the patterns around her.  I stared in awe.

She glared at me, "What are you looking at?"

I laughed, "Nothing.  Never seen a shift before."

She cocked her head at me like I was some strange vision before her.  "You are a strange, Feras."

I grinned at her.  "I'll let you go if you come with me.  You know the rules Naomi.  I could kill you now, or you can plead your case.  I'd prefer the latter."

She nodded and I let the net of air go.  "Why would you do this?  For me?  For Drake?  Why stick your neck out for us?"

I smiled.  "I have my reasons.  Your son will be safe.  I'll do everything I can to insure that."  

Now I only had to take them back to HQ and deal with paperwork.  I'd still make my meeting and Dae'lin would be happy.
