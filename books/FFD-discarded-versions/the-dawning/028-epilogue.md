The view from my glass office atop the Apex Unlimited building was gorgious this time of day.  The sun was behind me and I had a perfect view of the New York Skyline.  I was lost in thought of the recent merger I as contimplating but I kept being interrupted with random thoughts my 'sister' brought to my attention.  She'd been asking about old things.  Things she had no business knowing.  But things she knew about none-the-less.  All revolving around a recent accident.

A boy had jumped from the roof of the AU building and had survived.  Not really a paramount feat.  The kids have been doing it for a good 15 years or more.  Carenaning themselves over the edge using their gifts to save the day.  The irony of it all was, it was the very boy who had started the whole thing that plummeted to his near death.  

But it was the questions she asked.  "Once, I saw a book in your office - dad's office.  It was old.  It was about new races."  She'd brought the topic up more than once in the past month since the boy's fall.  He was healing miracuously - something unheard of for Venatori.  But here this boy was healing an injury he should have perished from.  Was immortality returning to the Venatori hunters like it had only gotten lost in the new genes introduced over the hundreds of centuries.  Or was this something new.  Something else?  

Whatever he was,  I needed to find out more.
