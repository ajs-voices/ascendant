“It looks like someone slaughtered and Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue.”

It was just a routine hunt, vampire, easy enough to track, easy enough to kill if you could find the nest.  If there were multiple vampires the nest during the day time was the best time to kill one.  And now Kai and Emilio were out hunting a singular vamp.  Or at least they thought it was singular.  It was old, he hadn't caused any problems, his sanity must be going awry for it to becoming this erratic.  

Venatori rules stated there was an acceptable amount of loss among the mortal races, which included the venatori.  But this creature had started taking more lives than it needed to survive.  Most vamps could and did survive without taking lives these days.  And this particular vamp had done so for years.  He was at times even curteous to tell the Venatori where he was going if he left town so no one came hunting him.  Something was wrong with him now.

It wasn't his task to figure out the why of it, only to end the exitance of one of the oldest vampires in New York City.  They had finally found his current nest, but it had been empty of all vampires.  The day was now near its end and there were things to do that weren't hunt related.  Emilio was at his best when they hunted.  His ability to know things about people was the biggest reason why Kai knew that something was amiss with the Bernstein vampire.  

Kai didn't know why they called him that, or why it was THE Bernstein vampire and not just Bernstein or clan bernstein.  There was probably some book or another in the Archives that said why, but it didn't help him hunt the vampire so it really didn't matter.  But the name was as old as dirt, as was the vampire.

"This has been a fools errand.  He's been long gone."  Kai stated the obvious as Emilio kicked over a pile of blankets on the floor.  The stench of a decomposing body filtered through the air now.  "Ugh, you had to do that."  Kai laughed at his friend who was now covering his mouth and nose as he fired his gun into the corpses head, just to be safe.

Kai did one better, he formed a pattern of fire that lept to life in the blink of an eye.  It caught Emilio off guard and he jumped back with a scowl on his face, "Tell me next time."

Kai grinned, "What fun would that be?"

Emilio rolled his eyes as he moved around the room making sure they left no hiding place unturned.  Vampires unlike most of the other supernatural creatures slept during the day and were essentially dead during daylight hours.  You could never tell if one was a vampire until it rose from the dead.  Some said that the Bernstein vampire could walk during the day.  They sometimes called him the Day Walker.  But that was pure fiction, and mostly a story that came from the stupid Blade movies.  The horror genre catered to the masses, and yet they got nearly everything just a little wrong every single time.  Maybe that was the Venatori PR campaigns at work, giving humans enough false information to just beleive in the unbeleivable on the silver or small screen, but never the truth that would curdle their blood and send them screaming for their life.

"Let's go.  There's nothing here."  Kai called out to Emilio who had slipped into another room while Kai finished up where they were.

Emilio poked his head into the room, "Yeah I know.  I'm not looking forward to going back.  Family Dinner.  Dorlores is insisting that everyone be on their best behavior.  Wanna come?"  The question at the end sounded very much like their times of old when Emilio would invite Kai to whatever summer or winter vacation his family was going on.  

Kai laughed, "Sure, if only to cause a scene."

Emilio smiled at his friend, he'd know exactly what he'd say at the offer of free homecooked food.  It was the same answer he'd given each time as a ckid growing up.
