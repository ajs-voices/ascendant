Dae'lin

Dae'lin was a master tutor, but she was relentless, there was no gray area.  And for a five year old that was hard to understand at first.  Nox's schedule was rigid, even more so than what she'd said.  Everything had a place and a time and you were never late.  Nox had been punished, sent to bed with water and bread for dinner, for being late to one class.  He went without food if he were late to any meal.  How Dae'lin found out about anything was nearly amazing.  She had eyes and ears everywhere, he couldn't get away with anything.

His grades plummeted once, to a B... a B! he was only 7 and she'd restricted his access to his gift with a nightly concoction that was worse than anything he'd ever drank before.  His gift was literally gone for a week, he could sense the patterns, couldn't feel the elements around him, it had been pure torture.

Roommates

Dealing with Dae'lin was the easiest part of his life as a child.  After Nox had gained control of his fire-starting ability he was put into a regular room.  A room with three other boys one to which Nox wasn't really pleased about.  

Aaron Woolbright was a black Magnus of the Fire kind, 4th level, from the Nomad clan of some po-dunk town in Illinois.  His parents Nox learned were fairly low in the hierarchy of things.  Neither were Magnus, but they each had siblings that were, they could probably learn if they wanted to, but they preferred to not, Aaron was their aspiration, he could do no wrong.  They sent him letters and care packages almost on a weekly basis.  Nox would have been jealous if he had cared enough to think about Aaron.  But Nox never even made eye contact with the older boy.  He was only a year older, but he seemed like so much more, he was larger and taller than Nox.  Nox let him believe he was stronger than he was too, lying about his designation whenever he could get away with it.  (Dae'lin caught him once in this lie, it didn't end well.)

Ross Cortes was a Hispanic Magnus from the Nomad clan as well.  This was the greatest clan of all the Aeternus, the most diverse and the predominate clan in North America.  Ross hailed from Houston, Tx, he wasn't nearly as captivated by the city as everyone else in their room was.  He'd grown up in one his whole life.  Ross was older than Nox by 6 years, he was the oldest in the room, yet he followed Aaron around like he was a lost puppy.  His hair was almost always greasy, he intentionally put oil in it to slick it back.  Nox thought he looked like some kid from the silly sing song movie Grease.  He even liked to wear the black leather that went with it.  He was an Earth Magnus, third level.

Jason Hill was a white breed american boy from deep down south.  His accent got picked on almost more than Nox himself, but Jason was twice the size of Aaron.  Not fat, he was solid, his parents were Venatori like Nox's mother.  Jason was the only one in the room who could bend more than one element, but air and earth, 3rd level.  He needed the element in his hand to actually bend, but he could create them so he was essentially 3rd level.  But for air that was easy.  He was good with air and earth.  Jason carried a small bag of sand in his pocket,. Jason was the only one of the three boys that Nox shared a room with that he actually got along with.

Sky Jumping

On one meeting with Dorian, they had taken a walk, it was part of the whole let's talk about your classes and training and stuff, they walked to the elevator and Dorian questioned him when he looked nervous, "Still can't ride the elevator?"

Nox shook his head, it was still something he avoided, the whole glass walls freaked him out pretty badly.  Dorian suggested that he try to break that fear of heights.  Start small he said.  And work your way up.

So that was what he did.  He started making himself take the elevator a few floors at a time.  Eventually it became easier but still not perfect.  He was still very wary of taking it from top to bottom even though Nox knew he was perfectly safe.

Nox was watching some stunt show on television with J and some of J's friends.  He wasn't overly interested but he watched anyway.  They were doing mostly stupid stuff, but one guy jumped out of an airplane with his parachute with a camera on his head.  They watched him fall from two different directions, one of the fall itself, and the second from the perspective of the jumper.  It was the worst feeling in the world.  The jumping and the falling made Nox feel like he was going to die.  It left his palms sweaty and panting for air.

The other boys had laughed, but J had just smiled and nodded.  He knew he was afraid of heights.  Nox didn't care if the others laughed, they were idiots anyway.

One evening after dinner and Nox had free time he and J went for a walk.  J had taken Nox to a low hanging balcony out of the way and climbed over the edge of the railing.   He made it look easy, J never once tried to guilt him over the edge.  For a week he brought Nox out to the edge of this balcony until Nox decided on his own terms to climb over the edge.  

Being stupid, or being brave, either way you look at it, Nox jumped from the balcony.  He created two patterns, the first to slow his decent with air, and the second to soften his landing.  It had been pretty fun.  J was unable to do both at the same time and unable to actually soften the ground was not something he could do until he was much closer, the limits of his ability were much greater than Nox's.  He jumped too.

For months they worked they way up to higher and higher heights until with in a year they were at the top of the building.  They had reached a point that if they went any higher it wouldn't matter anymore, so they were looking down from the top of the building.  

They jumped together, that first trip down.  They were both afraid, Nox knew it and J knew it, but together they had done a free fall before the air thickened around them and the ground went limp like quick sand catching them as they landed.  It had been a thrill.  And it soon became a nightly past time for them.  And as word got around, more and more people started flocking to their nightly ritual.  Most didnt' jump but nearly every young Magnus in the place watched at least once as a half dozen kids threw themselves off a building to catch themselves with their own abilities. 

September 11, 2001

8:46am - A loud noise echoed the halls of the dormitories.  Everyone heard it.  Some said they felt it, but we were miles away from the epicenter of the noise.  Everyone was scrambling to look out windows to see what caused the noise.  Billowing black clouds rose from the south.  Someone bright enough turned on the television in a near by room.  

Minutes later a second loud noise sent everyone into a panic.  Planes had crashed into the World Trade Center towers.  Not one, but two planes.  New York was in a panic.  Every phone was busy, every television set was on.  People were craning their necks at the windows looking and trying to watch the events as they played out.  

Mr. Lance had gathered up all the boys and had them sitting in the common room trying to distract them with some movie or another, citing, "Let the adults handle this."  All the girls were located in another room under the same restrictions.  A large room with no windows.  It served to panic everyone more, particularly those with families who lived in the City proper.  Some even had family working at the World Trade Center.  

An hour later the first tower fell.  Even miles away they could see the billowing cloud caused by the collapse of the building, the second tower fell.  One of the older boys had put on the news even though they had been told not to.  They watched in horror as one of the tallest buildings in the world crumbled underneath it's own weight.  

Some of the boys including Nox slipped up to the roof like they were going to sky jump.  The smell was profound up there on those heights.  It wasn't long before someone was rushing them back downstairs.  Everything was a mess.  The news replayed the scenes over and over again.  The ash and dirt covered faces of the survivors, the police and firefighters were played through over and over.  Families cried for lost loved ones.  The city was a disaster afterwards.  

They were all safe in their little world watching as the city reeled in the havoc caused by terrorists.  Nox was 8, he would remember that day forever.  The pain.  The suffering, and he hadn't even known anyone in the disaster, but that moment in time is etched into his memory.  Watching the building fall, the smell in the air, the confusion it would all last a life time.  

But one thing he remembered most was the solidarity of the New York denizens.  The world around them burned, but they pulled together.  It reminded Nox of Independence Day, the speech the president gives on July 4th right before they beat the enemy, how every nation in the world pulled together to get their freedom back from the aliens.  The images of the soot and ash covered faces were similar in notion to the movie Volcano when the little boy is asked what his mother looks like.  "I don't know."  He says, "They all look the same."  That was what it was like in New York during that tragedy.  It was the second most memorable thing.  The tragedy itself played through Nox's mind over and over again, solidifying his fear of flying.

Art Project

Life in the Imperordo and the Venatori training center was pretty intense.  And with Dae'lin as a teacher Nox had very little free time.  But there was one time a year, the annual Art's Festival that prompted some of the more extravagant uses of one's ability in the academy.  Magnus used their abilities to craft unique peices of art, all children of the Venatori were set to task of drafting some elaborate weapon or trap all in the name of art.  But it was truly a test of a child's ability.

Nox being both Venatori and Mangus had the option.  Most years he went for weapons, but this year Dae'lin had insisted upon an art project.  It was not something Nox was happy about, but the fact that he got to use his ability without her watchful gaze gave him some sort of happiness in it.

But Dae'lin didn't give him much time to play all alone, she insisted on watching him work.  And it quickly became a spectacle to watch with the number of people who stood just outside of the area Nox was working in.  His designated space for such works of so-called art.  There wasn't much a ten year old could think of doing.  He struggled through almost every class, including art.  He disliked drawing, or playing with clay.  All mundane methods, but this this was fun.  

Nox formed the base of earth.  It wasn't anything substantial, just a man standing with his hands above his head holding an orb of glass, the glass and everything inside was the fun part.  Nox bent earth and fire to create the orb of glass.  The glass formed around earth, air and water he created inside the orb as it formed.  The only part that Nox had not created was the seeds he'd planted inside the 3 foot sphere above the man's head.  Everything else he'd done himself.   

Dae'lin had watched him and she'd made phone calls, and the crowd had grown, Nox was only partially aware of the fact that there were people watching him.  It wasn't until Dae'lin stepped inside his area when he was completed that anyone said anything to him.  She asked, "How did you do that?"

Nox shrugged, he hadn't done anything differently.  "I did what I always do."  He was confused, he wasn't sure what he had done to cause such a stir.  There was hushed whispers all around.  He saw Dorian push through, he smiled at the man.  He was always friendly and Nox liked him.  

Dorian extended his hand and Nox took it firmly in his with a smile.  Dorian looked down at him, "You never cease to amaze me."  He turned to Dae'lin with a proud grin on his face, it made Nox's heart swell with pride.  He wasn't sure why but it was a good thing.  Dorian spoke to Dae'lin but it was loud enough for everyone to hear, "Nox has been designated NNC5."  He turned to Nox, "Young man, you proved me right, and I thank you.  Though I didn't expect you to show your talents so soon."

Nox grinned, "What did I do?"

Dorian laughed and looked at Dae'lin, "He doesn't even know."  Dorian smiled down at Nox, it wasn't as far to look up as it once had been to see those piercing blue eyes regarding him with pride.  "You bent all four elements at the same time, Nox.  That is a rare feat, even among those who can bend all four elements at all.  Be proud, young man.  You are special indeed."

Adept Testing

It wasn't long after the Art Festival that Nox was back in the testing room.  It was slightly early, but with his spectacle at the festival everyone had pushed his testing forward.  If Dorian believed he has indeed achieved the status of Cesari thus pushing him past Novice into Adept status, Nox would be the youngest in a very long time to pass the test.  And the youngest Cesari ever recorded.

Even the rumors that Nox was Cesari had been harrowing, Ross and Aaron were continually pushing him around, taunting him, trying to get him to use his ability for things Dae'lin would kill him for.

But the day of his testing came and Nox sat in the square room he always sat in, the two way mirror reflecting his image back at him.  His hair was a disheveled mess, he had barely a chance to dress much less get a shower in to tame his too long locks of brown hair.  He ran his fingers through it to try to straighten it but it was hopeless.  At least he had clean clothes on.  Nox had been avoiding his room for obvious reasons, his roommates constant torment.  

Nox yawned as the door opened and Dorian walked in, his usually well dressed and chipper self.  "Good morning, Nox.  Twice in as many weeks.  Usual."  He smiled at Nox and he couldn't help but smile back.

"Today, I have no doubt you will pass with flying colors.  It's not about complexity of the weave that determines your skill level, it is the time it takes you to accomplish a task.  In this box there are four tests, that have been tested over the generations to determine status from Novice to Adept.  Crossing the threshold of time determines your status.  For you three of the four elements must cross the threshold."

Nox nodded.  Dorian pulled out the four boxes and then started a silent timer.  Nox looked at the glass boxes and had to figure out exactly what the problems were and act upon the solution.  The past two weeks he and Dae'lin had been working on similar tasks.  Solve the problem, she'd anticipated his early testing.  He smiled.  It was a puzzle, Nox liked puzzles.

Each box contained objects and had different mediums, two air but one had water and the other had sand.  From the looks of the boxes they could fit together.  Nox took the first box full of air and a small object bouncing around inside.  There were several trigger points, but Nox's hands were too small to push them all at the same, but they were all on top.  Nox was pretty sure the object of each puzzle was to get the small objects out of the box using one element per box.  He could think of several for this box.  He set it back down and looked at the next one.

He continued the process until he'd examined each box.  He found an interesting pattern, each of the four boxes fit together, triggering one, helped trigger the next, and so on.   At one end of the four stacked cubes he created a small pattern of each element and stacked them like the four boxes, and made a key of sorts.  He pushed and all the items fell into the lower box.  The fire evaporated the water, the earth displaced more water revealing the small object that Nox took from it.  The sand had all shifted and now he could get that box too.  The steam unstuck the third ring from the bottom of it's box, and the fire had revealed a small bit of text that said, "Correct."

Dorian clicked the timer off.  "That was...."  Nox frowned, he didn't like the sound of that sentence.  Dorian continued, "interesting.  I've never seen anyone do that before.  You have done well.  You are hereby designated ANC5."

Dorian stood up and offered Nox his hand.  "It has been a pleasure as usual Nox.  Is there anything you need to change?  Any problems or anything?"

Nox took Dorian's hand and shook it gently, "No, sir.  Dae'lin treats me just fine and I like everything I'm doing."

"Good.  I will see you next year then."  Dorian smiled and opened the door.  Nox slipped out and walked down the hall towards his own room.

First Crush

Several weeks after his Adept testing Nox found himself wandering around looking for something Dae'lin had sent him on.  It was a scavenger hunt sort of.  He was required to find four very specific patterns that were around the compound.  Dae'lin said that these patterns were fixed, always there, but that the tended to be moved around, or there were many of them, depending on which one.  

Patterns were important.  Everything they did was patterns.  Math was a pattern, writing was a pattern, even hunting and eating were patterns.  Things done in a specific order to accomplish a goal.   And with the elements patterns were crucial.  If you could mimic a pattern you could create that object.  All you had to do was see that pattern.  

Nox had found all but one pattern, and he'd been wandering everywhere looking.  He knew he wasn't allowed in the adult residences, but Dae'lin had told him they could be anywhere, and her pass to be wandering around seemed to get him out of trouble when he got caught in the kitchens searching for the fire pattern he was after.  Ms. Sheila had caught him, and sent him packing with a smile.  But he'd found his pattern and he could tell Dae'lin exactly where it was, what it looked like.  He hadn't expected that pattern to be attached to a person, but it was.

Nox turned a corner and saw two people kissing.  He immediately turned back towards the way he had come around the corner and stopped against the wall.  He thought he'd seen Dorian kissing another man.  Nox peered around the corner to get a second look.  His eyes hadn't deceived him.  

Dorian was leaning against a door and a blonde haired man was kissing him, pinning Dorian against the door as he turned the door knob.  They kiss and stumbled their way into the room and when the door shut Nox let go of the breath he'd been holding.  His heart was racing and his palms were sweaty.  It was seconds before he could breathe again, and a minute passed before he found himself walking away from that spot wondering what had happened.  What was going on behind closed doors.  His mouth was dry as he thought about it all.  

It hadn't been the first time he'd seen someone kissing like that, but it was the first time he'd felt that way about watching someone else kiss.

Three days later Nox caught sight of Dorian leaving the cafeteria and his stomach fluttered.  A chill ran up his spine as he watched him walk away.  That night he had a strange dream.  Nox woke with little memory of the dream, but he remembered the feelings that had woken him up.  They lingered through out the day.

It wasn't common that he saw Dorian often, but every time he did for months he always had the same reaction, stomach flutters, chills.   It wasn't until Jason sat down on his bed one afternoon when before the other two roommates came in that any sense was made of it.  Jason was 5 years older, they were decent enough friends, far better than the other two roommates anyway.  

Jason asked, "You've been having some intense dreams haven't you?"

Nox nodded, "Yeah, what of it?"  He didn't particularly want to talk about the dreams he'd been having.

Jason grinned, "Oh nothing.  Just over heard the, 'Oh Dorian.' comment last night."

Nox froze, deer in the head lights kind of fear ran through him.  Jason laughed, "Hey, I'm not judging, thankfully Tweedledee and Tweedledum are heavy sleepers, I doubt they know. If you need to talk.  I understand, know the feelings well."

Nox looked at the other boy with confusion.  Jason smiled back at him, "No worries, Nox.  When you are ready, I'm here.  Open door."

Friends with Benefits

As Nox grew into his teens he started to act out a little more than he had prior.  He'd skip out after curfew and hang out with the high school kids in local neighborhoods.  They didn't know him, didn't judge him based on what he could or couldn't do they were human, they thought he was just like them.

Girls became a pretty big thing for Nox on his adventures in the real world.  He'd date a girl a few times and then have to switch his rotation up so he'd not get caught by the Headmaster.  He had sex with a handful of girls.   But his dreams still included a certain Scrin that seemed to be plaguing him even as he knew he liked girls.  He still pined after Dorian, still had the same reactions each time he saw him.  It never seemed to get any better, but thankfully it hadn't affected the way he acted around Dorian.  His roommates found out that he liked other guys as well and it became a joke and a threat, but it hardly bothered Nox. That was partially because Nox had become adept at covering up what he was actually feeling around anyone.  It's hard to pick on someone who just doesn't care or thinks everything a joke.  

Nox had just come from the pool, he'd done his thing and caught a glimpse of Dorian doing his own laps before he had to get dressed for the party.  It was the night before the Ad Aetatem.  Not Nox's he was still too young, two years though he'd see his.  Being Dimieater had it's advantages, graduation being 6 years earlier was one of them.  It also meant less time to learn and less time to grow as a Magnus.  But those in the powers that be didn't feel keeping a mortal a quarter of a century when they would die in that century was a good thing, so off they shipped them.

Nox's thoughts were on Dorian when he opened the room to his door and found J getting dressed.  He was pulling a pair of black dress pants over his ass.  Nox grinned, his thoughts still on Dorian this was an interesting view.  But he watched J for a few moments before he pushed the Scrin from his head as he shut the door and locked it behind him.  No point in dwelling on what he couldn't have.  Nox walked up behind J and touched his back.  J froze.  Nox ran his fingers lightly over J's rib cage to his chest and ran his fingers up the middle and down the far side pressing himself against J's back.

Nox had long since pulled past his roommates in terms of height, he was no long short, but he was still smaller than them in size in every other way, no matter the work he put in the gym.  J leaned back into him and put his hand on Nox's stopping him from caressing him.  Nox smiled as J turned his head to look at him from over his shoulder.  There was heat in his eyes.  Nox grinned, licking his lips, "That offer still open?"

J laughed under his breathe as he turned to face Nox and wrapped his arms around Nox's neck.  He looked up, it wasn't much but the height difference but it was enough.  J grinned at him.  "I guess it's never to late to ask questions."

Nox grinned down at J and kissed him softly, exploring the idea that they were going to do this now.  "I don't so much as have questions."  He pulled a short distance away and smiled, "I want to know your touch."  

J kissed Nox roughly then pulled away from Nox completely with laughter in his eyes, "No you don't.  You want to know Dorian's touch."

Nox frowned, "Yeah, maybe so but that ain't happening.  Should I deny all my feelings because I pine over one guy."

J grinned, "I'm just a substitute."

Nox shrugged, "You aren't."  Nox moved closer to J and put his hand on J's cheek and smiled, "Yes I was thinking about Dorian when I walked in.  He had been at the pool, he was half naked, and all I wanted to think about was where that tattoo of his ended.  I walked in here, you are half naked, right in front of me, within my reach.  I could pretend you were him.  But that would be such a waste.  I know YOU.  I can touch YOU.  I want to touch YOU."  Nox took a step closer and put his other hand on J's waste and pulled him close, "I need to touch you.  Not Dorian.  YOU.  You are here.  I want YOU."

J smiled and kissed Nox with an eager tongue.  He pulled away breathless, they both were breathless, J's voice was heavy with desire, "'Bout damn time." "I just wanted to hear you say it.  I don't mind that you want him.  I got one thing he doesn't."

Nox laughed, "What's that?"

J put his forehead against Nox's, "YOU."  J kissed Nox thoroughly.

J lead Nox through his first sexual encounter with a guy.  They were lying breathless together on Nox's bottom bunk when Ross and Aaron returned, catching them naked together.  J made a show of kissing Nox before he crawled from bed.  Nox sat up and watched as J got dressed with little regard for the open door and the other two boys staring at them like they'd seen a ghost.  

Nox got up letting the sheet slip from him and he started to get dressed.  Ross and Aaron never picked on Nox again after that.  They were too afraid that he'd try to kiss them than the fun they could have had poking fun at the fact that Nox was into guys.  Fear won out over games.  Which was alright by Nox.

J and Nox went to the party semi-together.  They danced with nearly every girl there.  A few almost caused J and Nox to get black eyes, but it was the girls loss not theirs.  They moved on.  It wasn't until the last few dances that J pulled Nox on to the dance floor and they danced together.  The first few songs had a strong beat.  They danced, it was fun.  Just two friends hanging out.  Then the last song of the whole thing played.  Slow sappy and J pulled Nox close.  They danced slowly, like they had with the girls before.  They both laughed softly to each other, faces pressed close as the others  stared and giggled around them.  Nox kissed J and Nox was pretty sure he heard a gasp from near by.  Whispers were heard over the music.  By the end of the dance, they were being talked about from one end of the floor to the other.  

Both J and Nox walked out of the party holding hand and with the knowledge that whispers and rumors were about to fly about them.  Nox didn't care.  J stopped Nox at their room door and pinned him up against the wall.  "That was for them.  So Aaron and Ross could have more fodder.  I don't care what the world thinks about me.  I don't think you care either.  But you, me.  We are friends.  What happens in that room, is between friends.  We are too young to deal with forever and always.  No strings attached, alright with you?"

Nox leaned down and kissed J, "If it still means we can do what we did tonight I'm happy with this."

J smiled, "Good.  Let's give them a little more to talk about then."  J opened their bedroom door and they added fuel to their fire as well as to the rumors that were flying around about them.
