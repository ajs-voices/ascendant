There was a little whelp of a boy outside his door.  He'd knocked furiously until Kai heard him through the fog of sleep.  Sure it was 3pm and Kai was still in bed, but he hadn't gotten in until 8am and then he had paperwork to fill out thanks to the lovely woman that was his boss.  Protocol couldn't wait even for a few hours of sleep.  So he filed paperwork while that woman sat in a posh office and had nothing more than papers to push.

The boy looked up at him with fear in his eyes, the stubble on his face, the fog in his voice made him sound even angrier than usual.  "What?"

The boy staggered back with fear.  He stuttered as he spoke.  "Ms... Ms. Rivera sent me to tell you.  Mr. Vega needs to see you in his office."

Kai blinked, "Mr. Vega's office?  Emilio doesn't have an office."

The boy stammered again, "Not that one... Dorian Vega."

Kai nodded, "Okay."  He shut the door and wondered why the boy Vega was looking for him in his office.  He wasn't going to give no damn graduation speech.  Kia took a shower, he had to wake up some how.  The coffee pot had some old coffee in it, he smelled it and it didn't smell good.  Maybe the boy Vega would have some, or he could pick some up.

Kia walked through the compound weary, he hadn't had nearly enough sleep.  The academny offices were small and it had been a very long time since he'd actually have to come up here.  He wondered what Nicholas had done this time.  He better not have been found with another boy.

The door to Dorian's office was open, the man sat at his desk writing a report.  Kia knocked on the door, "What's the boy done now?"

Dorian looked up and frowned, "Nicholas is fine.  There is something else I need to discuss with you.  You probably want to sit for this."

Kia felt releived.  "Okay, what's so bad?"

Dorian clasped his hand in front of him and looked across the desk at Kia, "Do you remember Leanna Durante?"

Kai shook his head.  "No.  Should I?"

"She's a human venatori in Colorado you were in her neck of the woods in 93."  Dorian turned to his computer and tapped a few things in, "A vampire was passing through you were hunting."

Kai shrugged, "There are a lot of women back in those days.  I'm sorry.  Why is she important?" 

Dorian pushed a file forward and Kai picked it up.  It was a rather large file, with a name written on the tab "Nox Durante".  "Her son?"

Dorian nodded, "And yours."

Kai look at Dorian with disbelief.  "A son - a half human son, now that's impossible."

Dorian shook his head, "Sorry.  Not impossible, improbable.  He's Cesari."

Kia blinked at him.  "Cesari?  Everything about the boy is... what was the word you used, improbable?"

"Yes sir.  He's unique.  But he is your son.  If you need the proof I can add that to his Ad Aetatem testing.  Which is why I asked for you."

"Ah, Severing of ties, and I assume Nicholas is as well?"

Dorian nodded, "Yes you will have two this year, atypical I know, but Nox's irregular parentage accounts for that."

"No proof necessary Dorian, if you are certain. I'll be there."

"I am certain he is your child, as is his mother."  Dorian reassured Kai of the facts and Kai was sure that he didn't really care one way or the other.

"His mother would like you to meet with the boy before his rite.  I can pass your answer on to Ms. Durante."  

Kai sighed, "Fine, I'll meet the boy.  May I take this file?"

Dorian nodded, "I will forward the dinner details to your phone.  That is the copy of your copy of his file.  I knew you'd want to presue it more throughly."

Kai laughed, "You are your father's son."

Dorian smiled, "You asked to see Nicholas academic record too if I recall, only last week."

"So you weren't anticipating my needs necessarily only remembering what I did for my youngest son."

Dorian nodded, "I don't have my father's gift of knowing things about people.  Mine tends towards photographic memory.  As your's tends reading the moments that are about to happen."

"And my half-human son's abilities?"

Dorian shook his head, "He is Cesari, is that not enough?  The boy is minorem, sir.  He is NMC5.  His aptitude is human.  His physical prowess is human.  Healing is extraordinary, his senses extraordinary.  The council deems his natural ability to bend all four elements at his power level and skill level at such a young age is viable venatori DNA."

"He's already mastered the elements?"

Dorian nodded.  "I tested him myself three times."

"Three times?  Did you not beleive it?"

Dorian shook his head, "No, there was no question.  The second time was for Dae'lin, the third was to record and show Mark Green.  He was not impressed which is why I recorded the third attempt.  He's your temper and I was afraid he'd refuse to preform any more."

Dorian turned the monitor around and pushed a key on his keyboard.  "I figred you'd want to watch that too."

Kai watched as a tall kid lumbered through the door.  "Again?" He asked, disgruntled.

Dorian nodded, "This is the last time, I promise."  The image of Dorian pointed at the camera, "The camera will record the actions as proof.  Not nearly as effective as watching you.  But will let you stop preforming, even though I know you enjoy showing off."

The boy grinned.  Kai had to laugh, he would have done the same thing.  Dorian's voice could be heard but the camera was focused on the boy, his long fingers moving the five different boxes of the mastery test together. "Pause it."

Dorian stopped the recording. Kia asked "He passed through expert when?"

Dorian smiled, "Two minutes before I gave him the master cubes."

"Why did you give do that?"  It was perplexing, and highy unheard of to do this in this manner.  None had done it to his knowledge.

Dorian handed Kai a peice of paper.  The boy's name at the top of the form, and he read down the sections and saw the time.  "He did the expert test in three minutes? That's hardly extraordinary."

Dorian pointed down to the comments. Kai read outloud, "3 minutes total for all five elememnts."  Kia looked up at Dorian waiting for an explanation.

"Nox stared at the the boxes for 2 minutes and 45 seconds. They all fit together in a very specfic pattern.  He remembered this from his Apprentice testing.  He did the same thing then too.  I did not even know they could do this and I've done this test countless times since I've been in this position.  He wove all four elements at the same time and each of the loops fell into place perfectly aligned in the appropriate patterns."  Dorian pulled up a picture from his phone and showed it to Kia.  "I took a picture because I'd never seen it done that way before, and I've seen 45 different ways to pass the test, his was the 46th."

Kia shook his head, "Why master then?"

Dorian sighed, "Because I was curious to see what he could do.  I did not expect him to pass in record time.  Even if he were to have worked individually on each box in the same time he did the whole test, he would have beat every other person who's ever taken the master test, and that includes Mark Green."

Dorian pushed play of the one minute and 23 second video again.  Kai watched as the boy fitted the last box together and and wove all the elements again at the same time and the peices fell into place.  He turned the box around and sideways and wove again, and the peices fell again.  He did it again with ease and then each element light into a bulb at the other end of the box.

Dorian turned the monitor around.  "Sir, your son, has a knack for puzzles.  While not a recognized talent for most venatori, mostly seen as childish games, it is his mental predisposition.  He has no acadmenic excellence, the only reason his grades are straight A's is because Dae'lin set rules and he lived by them.  He has been in my office more times than I can count.  And he has been highly disruptive in the rules around here.  But it is Dae'lin who has seen that he will be a very good venatori agent."

Kai nodded and stood up.  "How does he compare to the rest of his class?"

Dorian tapped away at the keyboard and pulled up what Kai would only think of as the standings of all his class mates.

"Let's see.  Academically he was slated as second in class until the past month when he fell to somewhere still in the upper tenth percentile."

Kai sat back down and interrupted, "Why did he fall?"  

Dorian shook his head, "That was my fault.  I told him his status was looking good to be solutatorian of his class, he specifically pulled Cs on every final he took.  Now before you get angry at his attempt at failure, he was far more creative in his attempt than just answering half the test or whatever percentage was required.   He went through each test, I can only imagine marking down the side of the page which one's were easy and which ones were 'hard'  he tallied the grades and he did only enough of the hard ones progressing down to easy to get a 75 percisely on the dot.  He didn't answer anything wrong, just didn't answer the questions.  Dae'lin was upset until I showed her the actual test.  He didn't want to be recognized as 'smart'.  He's a nobody it's what he wishes to remain and there wasn't much Dae'lin could do for his Cs at that point.  He had a problem, he solved it like a puzzle.  He doesn't realize he's doing it half the time.  I'm sure he was just proving a point.  Yes I'm smart but you don't have to tell the world.  His dry sarcastic humor thought out as a puzzle."

"Ironic yes?"

Dorian nodded and continued with is standings, "He falls to the bottom in physcial arenas, except for the competitions.  He's usually in the upper ten percent there as well.  He found away to compensate for his lack of abilities.  His gift becoming part of the weapons he weilded, the shields he projected.  Some called it cheating.  But he never used that ability unfairly.  He could have easily thrown walls of air up and been untouchable.  He could have fought with air as the only thing, never moving his body.  He didn't."  Dorian turned his screen again and there was a video of a fight.  "All of this is available on his public record, you are free to browse at your leisure."  Dorian hit play.

Kai watched as the tall skinny kid went up against a very large black man.  Dorian added, "His opponent is his roommate, Aaron Woolbright, the two are known to get into regular fights in the halls, or their room.   Aaron expect to beat Nox down."

The fight progresses as Kai assumed it would the larger man getting the advantage early on, due to speed strength and agility benefits of the Venatori.  The kid though, he takes each punch that he can't avoid and misses quite a few, glancing blows, they look like the hit him and are deflected, that must be his ability in action.  Ten minuites in and Nox has not gone on the offensive once, the boy taking a beating, but the large black man becomes overly assertive, which was exactly what your weaker opponent would look for.  The kid was patient, he waited, took the beating, and as soon as the bigger man pushed just too far, he took advantage.  The bigger man was over confidident left holes that the smaller opponent took advantage of.  Soon the tides had changed, the kid landing every punch he threw and a swipe of the leg and the much larger man was on his back and Nox knelt on his chest with a knee at his throat and a fist ready to make the killing blow.  The ref blew the whistle and the match was over.  Kai looked to Dorian with a nod.  He was impressive, but why had no one told him of his son.

"Why did no one tell me about him before now?"  Kai was perplexed and couldn't fathom why he'd been kept in the dark, I mean I live here.

Dorian shrugged, "Only a handful knew before today.  I was told not to tell you or he who his parentage was.  A possible venatori experiment, I do not know.  I can only suspect that it is to see two of your own children competing.  It is not often they get a chance to see how the same genetics preform at the same level with different parenting techniques.  I imagine your sons have been watched highly by those in the know."

"Did you know this whole time?"

Dorian frowned but nodded, "I did.  I was told not to tell you."

Kai sighed, "So much for family bonds eh?"  He knew Dorian was just following orders, he shouldn't be upset at the man.  But he had ample oppurtunity to tell him, their families were friends for years upon years.  Before Dorian could respond, "I understand.  I'm sorry.  Anything else improbable about the boy?"

Dorian shook his head, "No sir.  He's a typical boy from, as typical as any of your other children."

Kai nodded and when he stood up this time he offered Dorian his hand, "Tell your father we should do dinner again soon."

Dorian nodded, "Next I speak with him."

Kai grinned, "I expect you to remember to tell him."

Dorian smirked, "Of course, sir.  Hard to forget.  Really." 

Kai turned and left with his son's file.  He had another son.  A half human son, one from a woman he hardly remembered.  It was times like these where he wished his gift was a bit more controllable, he wouldn't have been surprised, but it didn't work like that.

An hour later while Kai was perusing the file Dorian had given him about the boy as he nibbled at breakfast in the common area, he received a text from Dorian with information on when and where to meet for dinner that night.

The more he learned about the boy, the less he liked him.  Probably because he reminded Kai too much of himself at that age.  He frowned at the disciplanry records the most.  He was caught on a regular basis with alcohol in his system but never drunk while his friends were fall down drunk.  Always caught with the same boy, and the other boy was always fall down drunk.  Always... And then there was the question of him and his own son.  Kai remembered the situation , it was a turning point in his and Nicholas' relationship.  Kai didn't understand his own son anymore, and now he had someone to blame for it.  His apparent other son corrupted him known son.  The irony!

Dinner was at a fancy restaurant.  Kai owned nothing more than jeans unless it was a funeral he was going to, and he didn't think that appropriate.  So he donned a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and the coat jacket that went with the suit.  It was as 'fancy' as he could be going to meet this woman he'd shagged passing through town once or twice and her improbable son.  Everything about the boy was improbable.  He was born of a human woman, the likely hood of survival rate was incredibly low.  He was cesari, another rare feat, and he was a master before the age of 20.  Everything about the boy screamed liar, but Dorian had meticulously documented everything about his son.  He expected every other cesari was likely watched like a hawk by that man.  He was the resident expert on the matter, as well as other rare phenomenon, which his apparent son fell into.  Disbeleif was just beyond him - not stupid but stupid enough to get caught drunk, and stupid enough to fail tests on purpose.  Kai sighed as he walked into the restaurant.  It was about damn time to get this over with.

The moment he walked in he recognized the woman she was of course almost 20 years old then the last time he'd seen her, there were wrinkles crinkling the edge of her eyes and lips.  She had a few extra scars he could see since their last encounter, but it was the way she dressed that caught Kai's eye - and not in a good way.  The sheer fabric was see through except for places at the chest and groin area, her hair was pulled away from her neck, the woman dressed like she was 20 still.  

Her son was far better dressed, he could praise the boy for his attire compared to both his parents.  He was wearing all black with a blood red tie that hung loosely from his neck.  His mother moved to straighten it and he batted her hands away before she saw Kai approach.  She dropped her hands from the boy's tie and tried to smile warmly through the fake smile and blindingly pink lipstick. 

The boy offered his hand and Kai nodded before he sat down.  He hadn't meant to offend the boy, and he didn't seem to take it as an insult.  Kai was trying to push his buttons, it was part of what he did to everyone, test their limits, and this boy who was supposedly his, was new to him.  "Leanna."  Kai added to her with a nod.

The waitress came, "My name is Sarah, I'll be your waitress this evening.  Can I get you anything to drink?"

The boy spoke before anyone else did, "Hi Sarah.  I'll have water."  He looked to Kai and his mother for their drink orders.  

Kai nodded, "A glass of your finest red."  

Leanna looked to Kai with a sweet smile and then back to their waitress, "I'll have the same."  Kai hoped to hell and back that she didn't expect him to pay for her meal.

The waitress left and Leanna started speaking about old times, Kai kinda drowned it all out while he looked at the menu.  Kai noticed from the corner of his eye that the boy was pointedly ignoring his mother as well.  He wondered how they got on, it didn't look like it was real well considering there was no attention bestowed upon her son.  He had been away from her for 15 years without a visit from her.  Perhaps that was the reason in and of itself, she cared nothing for the oddity of a child.  She was venatori, human but still a ventori agent, a hunter of supernatural creatures.  To have your child spark without knowing he could was probably very daunting.  She probably feared him.  It made a pang of sorrow cross his gut, but nothing showed on his face.

Leanna never stopped talking, she filled every moment of silence with words until the waitress came back with their drinks.  Nox quickly took a sip and smiled at the waitress she blushed.  Kai held back the smile that threatened to splay on his lips, for all that he was improbable the boy was still a boy. 

Kia ordered for everyone.  Nox looked a little disappointed at what he'd ordered in general.  It was again Kai's attempt at breaking the boy, to see where his limits were.  But he said nothing only looked at the waitress again with a smile as she left.  A bus boy skirted around their table and smiled at Nox.  Nox grinned at him too.  

Kai watched the small wordless interaction play out, there had to be more than just casual flirtations there.  Kai never asked, none of his business who the boy flirted with.

When the waitress was gone, Leanna once again filled the table with flowery and sickly sweet words complimenting Kai, but never touching her son, the day was about him and she ignored the boy.  He didn't seem overly bothered by it.  He was clearly bored though, but he never pulled his cell phone out, he never slumped in his chair, he feigned more intrest than Kai himself.  He was a perfect gentleman except for his inscent flirting with both female and male alike.  At least he wasn't playing sides, Kai could give him props for that he didn't understand that anymore than Nicholas perversions.  He chided himself for his choice of words.  He was a good kid too, he liked boys, it was hard to get past.

Kia half listened only nodding once and a while while Leanna continued on some triade about one of her last hunts.  Normally he'd have been interested, but the boy's flirtations were far more interesting.  Their waitress would give a little wave as she past and he'd grin and she'd blush.  The bus boy was so preoccupied with Nox, Kai saw that momentary flash that said something bad was about to happen.  And two seconds later the try bus boy was carrying with dishes started to move in slow motion.  It could have ended badly, Kai was already on his feet before the tray was more than even an inch off balance, he was moving to help the kid when the tray straightened seamingly from nothingness, Nox was standing steading his friend with a hand on the tray and one at the small of the other boy's back.  The bus buy looked up at him in gratitude and Nox grinned down at him as he sat back down.

Kai knew that the tray had stopped falling long before Nox's hand was there, he'd seen the momentary flash, patterns of air could be the only explanation.  Kia nodded, "Nice catch."

The could-be son of his grinned at him and Kai got the full effect of the boy's charm, "It was nothing really.  I'm surprised you didn't get there faster than I did."  He waved his hand like it had been nothing.  Dorian had been correct, he compensated with his ability, it came like second nature, Kai hadn't even thought about his magnus ability.  

Leanna has barely noticed the incident or their exchange and continued to rattle off things.  Their silence continued until their food came out.  The boy looked at the tray of overly fried foods and was disappointed.  Everything breaded in laden with grease like it had been at a fast food joint.  Kai's own plate was the same but it was enjoyable for him.  He ate with gusto.  It was fairly good.  Nox picked at the fish and debreaded a few things, and ate the roasted vegetables on the side.  But he never complained, not once.  Kai had to say something now, "Don't like seafood?"

Nox looked up from his plate and shook his head, "It's not that.  Fried food and I don't get along."  He grinned trying to take the burnt of the harm done off or at least that's what Kai would have done in his place.

Kai nodded, "I will remember that in the future."  There was no point being rude about it, he actually hadn't anticipated that the boy ate healthy.  He was tall and thin and looked like he could have a few extra pounds put on him.  "I find it hard to beleive you don't just eat anything, most boys your age do."

"Oh I eat plenty.  I just don't tend to fry it so ... heavily."

Kai sighed, "Don't tell me you are one of those vegans or such."

Nox gave a sharp laugh, "Hardly.  I like meat just like you normal folk.  I eat a lot of it as a matter a fact.  Grilled, baked, roasted."  He grinned, "I'm starting to sound like Sam Wise."

Kai raised an eyebrow in question, "Lord of the Rings.  Sam Wise rattleing on about how you cook a potato."  Nox waved his hand, "It's not important."

"So not only are you a health nut, you are a geek too?"  Kai was trying to get a rise out of the boy and he was failing miserably which was unusual.

"If that's what you want to call it, I suppose.  I'm not all.." The boy threw his hands up to his face and continued with a look of complete exuberance, "oh my god you said the wrong reference."  He laughed, "I don't have that kind a time.  Dae'lin insures my time is better spent."

Kai nodded, "I'm sure.  Drills and studying."

The boy nodded knowingly but didn't extend upon that. "Your friend, Mr. Hill wasn't it, you and him get in trouble a lot."

Nox laughed, "No more trouble than others I suppose."

"That's not what I've seen.  Nearly every break of curfew has been with that boy and you'd been drinking and escorting your friend upstairs."

Nox laughed, "That was only the times we actually got caught.  Jason's a bit of a lush, but he didn't tend to always involve me in his roucous returns."  He grinned like he was hiding more information.

"So in other words, you snuck out more times than you got caught."  The boys face lit up like a Christmas tree, not in embassment, in happy acknowledgement that he'd gotten away with things.  Kai couldn't help but shake his head, the parent in him wanted to ground the bastard until he was 30, but that was not something he could actually do.

"Let's just say they never actually caught me when Jason wasn't falling down drunk."

He admitted to breaking rules.  But then again he'd questioned him on it.  But really what boy didn't break the rules, Adam and Tobais were both very rambuctions in their early years until he put his foot down.  Dae'lin wasn't enough to keep this boy in line.

Leanna had finally stopped talking when they'd started talking she tried to interject several times before she finally stopped but the moment they had fallen into a lull in conversation she started up again.

The bus boy who'd nearly had an accident came back carrying his jacket and leaned over and whispered in Nox's ear, his son showed no signs of what he was saying except for the grin that spread on his face.  The bus boy left with a clasp of a hand, in a semi-sorta highfive holding hand jesture.  

Leanna had finally noticed the bus boy and Nox and the frown on her face said how much she disapproved.  She leaned over the table, her breasts nearly in her plate and she waggled a finger at her son, "How dare you flaunt this crap in front of us!"

The boy sat there and took the abusive comments.  Kai could tell he was fighting the urge to roll his eyes at his mother.  Someone had kept the boy's manner's in check at the very least.  Kai could have interjected, while he agreed with her he didn't agree with her treatment of her son.  He hadn't flaunted anything, he'd been flirting with the waitress too.  And is his thought summoned her she asked "Will there be anything else?"

Nox grinned up at her, "No, Sarah, there won't, can I have the check please?"

She looked at him with a grin and nodded.  She left for her register to ring up the total and Nox pulled out his wallet and dropped a ten on the table.  When Sarah came back he handed her another five and took the bill from her.  She grinned madly at him for the excessive tip.  He hadn't even looked at the bill yet.  He didn't pass it to Kai, or his mother, he looked at it quickly and pulled out money Kai didn't expect a child of any age to have.  "Where did you get all that cash?"

Nox looked up as he placed the full amount and then some more from the look of the price on the receipt.  He grinned, "I worked for most of it.  But both Dorian and Dae'lin contributed to the cause."

"Both of them?"

"Yes sir.  But I won't need to use their money, I'll return it all.  I expected my mother to choose something a little more outside my budget when she said 'fancy' restauarant."

Nox stood up and pulled the chair out for his mother, gentlemanly until they were outside the door and he walked past her without a second glance.  He hadn't even waved good-bye as he stood at the edge of the sidewalk.  Kai stopped next to him, "What did you do to earn the money?"

Nox laughed, "Dae'lin put me to work."

"Doing what?"  Kai was truly curious.

Nox sighed, "Solving cases, started out as old, then she started throwing in new fresh cases that hunters were having a hard time connecting peices on."

"And you didn't want to tell me that why?"

He frowned, "Two cases ago I worked on one of yours, I didn't give you the information before you figured it out yourself.  That morning you made the kill, I had the answer that afternoon."

"And that's a reason to sigh?"

Nox laughed, "No and yes.  Most people don't know what I'm doing for Dae'lin before I've graduated.  When they find out a kid helped them they get bent out of shape.  When they find out a minorem helped them they usually have words with Dae'lin.  I'd prefer Dae'lin not be yelled at again on my behalf."

"I guess I'll see you tomorrow then."  Kai left the boy standing on the curb like he was waiting for something.  Turns out he had been, the busy boy pulled up in a late model Honda and Nox climbed in.  His mother was flirting with some man at the door and Kai sighed, she would never change it seemed.  

Kai wasn't exactly sure what to think of his son.  Improbable.  Ordinary.  Both all rolled into one.
