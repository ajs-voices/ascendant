Nox's PoV

Sky jumping had become part of Nox's nightly ritual.  What had started as a way to overcome his fear of heights had fast become a game and a cult following.  His roommates except for J only watched.  Aaron and Ross usually only egged on those who could actually jump.  They were trying to get people to make a mistake.  God forbid anyone die, Nox would probably kill his roommates himself.

It was well past curfew they should have all been in their beds there were a few new faces watching.  Nox had already jumped. He usually went first.  Mostly he went first because it was his game.  But it was his reminder to others how to do bend air correctly. 

At the bottom Nox had waited for J before heading back up.  They were the only ones who went back up to watch the others.  Nox had to make sure no one got hurt. It was just something he felt he had to do.

There were a few new faces even since his jump earlier.  A kid of about five stood near the edge.  He was looking over.  Ross came up behind him and pushed him nearly over the edge.  The hand holding on to his shirt was the only thing keeping the kid from falling.  Nox made a move to stop him but someone was already stepping in.  Nox's heart fluttered at the dark haired man grabbed the kids arms and pulled him towards more stable footing.  Nox could have sworn he got the scent of vanilla and cinnamon as Dorian had walked past only moments before.  His body ached and he could barely breathe, he was still crushing on this man, years after it had originally started.  Unrequited love or some such J told him.  

It was mere moments, and the interactions between Ross and Dorian resulted in Ross shoving Dorian.   The soles of Dorian's polished shoes were the last thing that Nox saw as Dorian tumbled over the barrier.  Nox heard gasps and saw people scramble to the edge.  Nox didn't think he acted.  In two long strides Nox was diving over the barrier head first, moving faster than he had every fallen before to catch Dorian before he hit the ground.  The rush of air made Nox lose his breath.  In a moment he speared past Dorian and flipped around to see how Dorian fell.  Nox spread his arms and legs, slowing his descent minimally, he thickened the air around them as Dorian mimicked him and crashed into Nox's body.   The jolt nearly sent them spiraling but the air around them gave way to little motion other than down.

Nox wrapped his legs around Dorian and locked his feet together.  Nox cast a web wide creating a parachute of air to help slow their descent even farther.  Moments before they crashed into the ground Nox softened the earth below.  They crashed into the semi-soft ground and tumbled together, rolling across the lush green grass. 

The air had fled Nox's lungs on impact, but they were safe as Nox tried to regain his breath.  There would be nothing more than bumps and bruises all around.  

Nox lay underneath Dorian as they both caught their breath and regained their composure.  Nox's heart was racing for more than one reason.  The man he had been watching for years was silently was lying on top of him, he fought his natural reaction.  Dorian looked down at him and was just a small distance away from Nox.  Nox could smell the vanilla and cinnamon and the scents of home lingering on the man's neck.  Nox closed the distance quickly and pushed his lips against Dorian's.  Dorian's lips parted and Nox took advantage and slide his tongue against his lips and tasted Dorian.  Dorian pulled away breathless and Nox stared up at him as Dorian scrambled to get up mumbling, "Not now, Nox.  Not now.  We can't..."  

And Dorian walked away shaking his head.  Nox cursed at himself, what had he been thinking, what interest would Dorian have in him.  Why would he care a bout a 16 year old boy when you had 200 years on him?

Nox lay on the ground for another 10 minutes before J was sitting next to him.  Nox smiled up at his friend, "I kissed him.  I don't think it went very well."

J shook his head, "You are one stupid S.O.B.  Jumping off a building to catch him. I'm sure it's all just too much.  I'm sure it was all romantic and everything, but he probably shit his pants.   You kissing him was probably the last thing he wanted right then."  J put a hand on Nox's chest and grinned down at him, "He kiss you back?"

Nox sighed, "I don't know, he opened his mouth, I ..."

J grinned, "Good man."

They sat there saying nothing until the Headmaster called Nox's name.  It was just his name, but it said so much more than that.  It said you are in trouble, big hot water, you'll wish you were dead kinda trouble.  But it had been worth it, even if Dorian had almost died from the antics of his stupid roommate.  Nox had kissed Dorian, he could feel the lingering touch on his lips, he savored the last few free moments of it.  He knew he was going deep down into the dungeon's tonight.  At least everyone was fine, he'd pay the price for almost getting Dorian killed.

Dorian's PoV

Dorian had just brought in a few new kids, Magnus still young, still impressionable.  None nearly as talented as Nox Durante had been.  He still was a marvel to behold when he saw him during his tests.  It had been 10 years since the day he'd brought him in, and today he had another fire-starter just like he had been.  The biggest difference this go round though was that he was only a fire-starter and his parents loved him dearly, they had left him in the care of himself and Lance only hours before Dorian found himself up on the roof.  

The boy was looking over the edge, or he had been until Ross Cortes was holding him over the barrier.  This was another of the follies that Nox had created in his journey to becoming a man.  His greatest fear had been heights, when he was 8 Dorian suggested he conquer that fear, he hadn't meant hurdling himself from tall buildings, and it hadn't started that way, but it was how it ended up.

Now Nox had a following of strong and weak air benders following his suit.  But it was those strongest in air and earth that seemed to find the appeal far greater.  Jason Hill, a promising young Venatori, and close friend to Nox Durante was the one responsible for creating the small cult that followed Nox to the rooftops every night and dove off the building, catching themselves with their ability.  It was impressive to watch from the ground, but from up here, Dorian couldn't imagine taking that plunge willingly.

It was only moments, the boy was safely away from the edge and then Dorian was falling.  He vaguely remembered being pushed, and then stumbling and then falling, his knees buckling over the barrier's edge, Dorian scrambled to catch something but he was already falling.

Plummeting to one's death is an eye opening experience.  His life flashed before him, it had been a long life, a fulfilling one.  And then Dorian looked down and saw Nox of all the people hovering below him.   His arms and legs spread wide, Dorian mimicked him and knew it was fruitless effort, but once his body had collided with the boys, he could feel Nox wrapping his legs around him and he saw the patterns of air extend and surround and he watched as they slowed.  

The earth below gave way, but only enough to soften the blow, Dorian's weight crushed the air from Nox's lungs, he could see the other man gasping for air as they tumbled across the green grass.  At least it was grass was all Dorian could think.  Pavement wouldn't have been nearly so soft.  His thoughts were interrupted by a kiss, a slow tentative and very warm kiss from the boy beneath him.  Dorian parted his lips before he could think, before he... No.  This was a boy, a kid, he was sixteen.  It was wrong and Dorian pulled away, it just wasn't right.  Dorian had intended to tell him, not to out and out walk way, but he could only think to say "Not now, Nox, Not now."  He hadn't thought of Nox as anything but the boy who he'd brought in scared and afraid, and now that same boy was nearing adulthood.  He had kissed him.  A kiss that Dorian wanted to return, wanted more, but now was not that time.  Dorian walked away cursing at himself.  Everything was going to be different now.  He couldn't keep the boy from his mind.
