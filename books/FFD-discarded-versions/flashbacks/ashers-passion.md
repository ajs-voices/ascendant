# Asher's Passion

The Venatori are consistant if nothing else.  They are constantly blending into the human world.  Something that I'm not fond of, but it has it's merits.  Today I took the private plane to London where there is a scientific conference.  There are worlds of varying degrees of my interest here, but there are two things that of interest to me - the symposium on genetic modification and the Venatori only conference - invite only - the patterns of the Venatori.  They are the only two reasons I've come to London.

The country is wet and I abhor it.  I hated it when I lived here ages ago, and now I hate it still. It never changes.  My hotel room is warm and comforting and there is a nice little fake fireplace with a gas fire lit.  It keeps the cool damp air from my skin.

As mentioned before I am not the only Venatori here.  There are many Scrin scholars here and I've nodded generalities at several of them.  Most are unimportant to the grand scheme of things.  Researchers of varying levels - they all know me of course and skirt deferentially around me - none ever approaching.  For that I'm grateful.  I dislike their attentions.

Normally I would have had someone pick up my badge when I arrived, but this particular conference requires picture ID.  I scoffed when Andre informed me of it.  So I stood in the dreadful line, my every attempt to go around the red tape was thrawted with a nice british accent, "End of the queue."

I'd been in line for 20 minutes.  If we were in New York I would have been handed my badge before the event even started.  No such luck here.  Who doesn't cater to one of the richest men in the city - here I'm just another nobody.

The line - sorry we are in England - the queue was finally shorted to the point that I stood in front of the tables.  I looked down upon the clueless people as I handed them my ID.  The graying man looked up at me over his circular glasses and frowned,  "Dr. Eriksen have you been waiting long?"

I rolled my eyes.  "What do you think?"

He hurried and stood up.  The crosded sword tattoo was faded and writnkled but he was clearly Venatori.  Mine were descretely hidden by the hair on my head.  I dispised the thing.  "I am sorry, sir. Here is your badge.  I apologize."

Ever polite yet I waited 20 minutes because he never bothered to ask me my name.  The old Venatori man sat back down and I heard him whisper to his compatriot, "I can't beleive you told **him** to go to the end of the line."

The rest of the conversation was a bore.  Maybe I should dock the man's pay?  It was a thought.  Teach him right!

The first conference I was attending was that of the Venatori.  The room was small and there were chairs all in a row.  I sat in the middle of the front row.  The room was nearly empty except for the speakers.  I recognized all of them, most of them worked in New York's facilities.  There was of course my right hand researcher and the head of the Infirmary - Dr. Herbert Guerrero.  He nodded my direction when he saw me.  He would also be on the genetic symposium later this afternoon such was his work for me.  

Dr. Guerrero was involved in matching couples with the highest probilities together.  He also tested all the abhorrent Minorem that made it to their Ad Aetatem.  There was a minimum genetic marker allowed otherwise it was steralization for the child.  All should be if you asked me.  The dilution of our genetic material was a crime against the Aeternus we were born from.

Dr. Lauren Spaulding was a foreign Venatori who's speciality lie in the grand arena of Magnus patterns.  She was the leading most expert in what can and cannot be done with patterns.  She was a Cesari, however low level it was - a one I beleive.  Not that it made much difference in the Magnus society, she was one of the best there was.

And there was of course Dorian Vega.  The only non PhD in anything scientific.  His course of study in his college years had been psychology, which is of course why he is the head of testing and placement of the Academy.  But it his knowledge of Cesari that brings him here this day.  He is the leading expert in what Cesari are capable of.  He unlike others can see all the patterns they yield but he cannot touch them.  It is a unique gift and well suited to the testing those who are suspected to bending all the elements.  He has some rare cases as of late and this is the first time he's speaking on them.  Could this be something I hadn't expected?  Any break through at this point will prove to be an acheivement so many failures and some with such promise if I could only get them to comply.

I pretty much zoned out on Dr. Guerrero's talk as he began.  I already knew everything he was speaking about.  He had practiced his speech in my office once or twice so that I could correct or redact information he was supplying.  He droned on in his monotanous voice about how the genetic patterns of the Venatori were changing.  Which lead immediately into Dr. Spaulding's work on how interesting revelations in patterns themselves were emerging.  

It was amusing to listen to the woman speak on things that not everyone in the room could see.  She tried to draw pictures on slides to explain why we could not heal and why we couldn't replicate living things.  It was nothing new.  But it engaged a theoretical and philosphical debate between the tdoctor and the room.  One to which Dr. Guerrero had to interrupt so that Mr. Vega could speak.

It was absolutely the worst eventuality that this subject was last, as it was the only thing I truly wanted to listen to.  Mr. Vega started with the usual mumbo jumbo about the probability of Cesari and of other unusual statistics that make for improbable acts of nature.  All to facilitate the emergence of his latest case study, a young boy who has against all odds shown up to be Cesari.  A minorem level 5 cesari with a naturally high ability.

There was hardly enough time but we watched a snippet of the boy creating an art project for the annual fair.  I couldn't see the patterns in person, but neither does the video capture the child manipulating them.  Magically you watched a statue appear around dirt, a bubble of glass was formed from nothing, air and water were incorporated.  The power needed to preform the task had to be impense and this child of 10 was doing it with ease and unknowingly.  I would have to look into this boy.

Sadly the session ended.  But I stayed while those at the table milled around talking with others.  Dr. Guerrero stopped near me and I nodded towards him to get me Mr. Vega before he left.  He nodded knowingly.  He understood my obsession with new traits in our lines.  How had this boy escaped my eye?  I had to know more.

Mr. Vega approached me with a cool ease about him.  He smiled at me with a knowing nod, "Dr. Eriksen, it's a pleasure to have you in attendance today.  You do us a great honor."

The man was every polite even in the face of someone ripping his head off.  Perfect images were hard to maintain, even I understood that hardship but I had seen the Headmaster ripping the man a new one and he walked out calm, cool and collected.  I envied his cool exterior, and that was rare.  I was a hot head much like my name implied.  

I offered my hand to Mr. Vega.  "Mr. Vega."

He had the audacity to interrupt me, "Dorian, please."  I could forgive that, I supposed, he was making it less formal though I would not offer my own informalities.  I did have my own image to maintain.

"Dorian, then, I would like to chat with you about this young man yo've found.  I do not completely understand the uniqueness of him, but I have a desire to learn more."

The man nodded, "Anytime, sir."

"How about over dinner tonight, at 8?  The restuarant in house has a good menu and an excellent vintage of several wines."  I asked polietly but it was more command than request.

Dorian nodded, "Sounds wonderful, Dr. Eriksen.  I will see you then.  If you don't mind I have another panel to get to."  I nodded and he gave me a shallow bow and left without another word.  I wasn't exactly sure I could contain my excitement, I would, but this was new and new was excellent! * Never before had a child so young become proficient in the weaves.  I started committing to memory questions I wished to ask of Dorian.  Cesari from a minorem.  Did I over look something?  I had to have.  Doubt crept into my mind.  

I spent the remainder of my time in various symposiums only half paying attention to things.  Even the one I had been very interested in at the time.  Genetics did bring me out of my coccoon of thought.  Though it was short lived.  Dr. Guerrero was the only researcher with anything new to add to the panel but I had already heard everything he had to say.  It helps when your lab is the top most genetic research facility in the world.  

Apex Unlimited went into many fields of study, but genetic research was our top research program - for obvious reasons but I had to have my hobbies or these thousands of years of my life would have been a bore.  I could be like Bernstein - old and decreped and completely out of touch with reality.  He was of course the only 'person' that would ever conceive that an Aeternus might be living among the Venatori.  So far he was quiet and that's the way I liked it.

7:30 arrived and I was internally excited, but my PA was fussing over me like some depressed fool.  She was a wonderful woman, motherly and smart but it was about time to find another.   Every five years I fired the PA and started from scratch.  It was far easier to not explain the fact that I do not age to someone so close.  I would miss Ms Angelica.  But there would be another, and another.  I had never found someone completely irreplacable - and humans did such fine work.
