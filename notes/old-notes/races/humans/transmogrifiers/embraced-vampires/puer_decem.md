Vampires of the Puer Decem blood line are special and unique. There are only two in existence. Puer Decem means Child of Ten. These vampires were created by all ten council members to be the law for the vampire world. Procreation of these vampires is highly prohibited but has happened. These vampires have all of the powers of the council bloodlines though only those most practiced are the strongest.
