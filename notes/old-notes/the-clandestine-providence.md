## Creation Myth

We all know how it goes:  "_In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters._"

He created the light, the sky, the land, the plants,the sun and the moon, the fish and the birds, the wild animals, and then mankind.  What the human lore doesn't tell you is is that mankind is not just human.  Blasphemy I know.

Humankind was one of four races placed on earth by the creator - be he the one God of the Humans or the Air Empress of the Dragons - there are four unique races: humans, primeval vampires, aeternus and dragons.

Human's believe they are the only race of mankind because the other races are obfuscated from them by the Clandestine Providence - a set of laws designed to protect all of mankind.  Human's are fragile creatures compared to the other three.  Their very limited life span is only out weighed by the rate at which they reproduce.  They soon overtook the world and the obfuscation grew in nature and away from the world of the humans.

## The Evolution of the Four Major Races

All but one of the four major races have evolved into something different.  Dragons are wise beyond their years and their lines have been consistantly sheltered over the milenium.
