Random thoughts:
* To a rave with Dorian- possible drug usage - against Nox's usual standards but is with Dorian so he relents
* A Cruise that leads to some supernatural mess (ie: water monsters)
* Vacation in the hamptons leads to yet another supernatural mess (maybe a supernatural hurricane - or other weather event)
* Human siblings his mother never told Nox about with their father dying of cancer
* Dorian has a conference to attend overseas 
* Dorian give Nox a Mushu stuffed toy for a gift.  (Or something mushu related)
* Nox takes over CCB
