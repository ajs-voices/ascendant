# Ascendant

Nox is in the hosiptal under 'suicide watch' passing the time drawing patterns. (in hospital per Asher and Kaelin's instruction - patterns are Margo's idea)

Dorian is avoiding seeing Nox but can't help be intersted in what Margo has him doing.

When Nox get's out he's haunted by his fears even more even starting to see things during the daytime.  (Garrett's plan to grab control) - Note:  Garrett has been controlling Nox's nightmares from the get go through his little known talent for molding dreams.  He starts using both reality and the dreamworld to manipulate Nox.

Nox starts working with Drake - the dragon's son he captured from book one, and Aidan (Stella's son) and a few other younger children who look to be magnus.

Meanwhile Garrett is manipulating Stella (who Nox now knows is an ex-lover of Dorian's - Dorian is Aidan's father)

Nox proposition's Anabel with a new solution for her bloodline.  Asks Anabel not to tell Dorian who's helping her.

Nox helps Dae'lin out of the "goodness" of his heart.

Garret uses Stella to get Nox away someplace alone.

Kai and Emilio are hunting the Bernstein vampire and take Nox along to bring him out of his 'depression' even though he's not supposed to be hunting.

Garret plays with Nox's control enough he beleives he can get Nox to do whatever he wants - afterall the life of those he loves (Dorian, his impending children, Aidan, Drake, his father have all at one point been used against Nox - via Garrett) hangs in the balance.  - Tries to get Nox to go to Mark Green and kill him becoming leader of the Venatori!

Nox refuses and lights Garrett on fire and leaves near immediately - he doesn't know what happens to him.  

(after story:  Nox goes to Mark and Nox tells him of the CCB's plan.  They concoct a plan of their own that starts the next story)

- Garrett's motivation:
  * revenge: get back at the venatori for exiling him
  * fear:  the venatori are getting too strong
  * control: extert control over the strongest cesari alive
  * unnatural affection: wants the one(kid) who got away
  * betrayal: nox told someone, paybacks a bitch


# Exiled

* The cult is 'political' in nature - it seeks to rid the world of Venatori rule. Until recently the cult used pacifist measures to state their claims, never coming to violence.  The cult is usurped by Garret and two were creatures who take this peaceful group and turn them into the Venatori's worst nightmare (and Asher's) by threateneing to expose their world.

Garrett's actions for the CCB push Nox towards an action he never thought he'd make.  As part of a plan with Mark Green.  Nox pushes his views openly to the Venatori and renounces them completely - becoming Exuli.

Now in Exile Nox falls into old habits throwing himself lower and lower into the cesspool of his own mind.  Unable to do much in the real world he eventually finds himself doing parlor tricks on the side of the street for change.  

Elaina Johnson, the girlfriend of Charles Saunders, cheif "bodyguard" of James Wright of the CCB, finds Nox and starts telling him about her friends.  Nox knows she's a were creature at first sight.

Possibility (Elaina is Charles wife - it's their daughter - Nox's age who finds Nox - Elaina still is the one to betray Charles with Nox)

Nox goes to a meeting.  Things go from there, he joins.  To prove his loyalties lie with the CCB they ask him to cover or remove the tattoo.  His fear of needles making it all the more powerful.  Nox draws a pattern that will cover the old tattoo.  It spans from the middle of his forhead, over the right temple, down the side of his face around his eye, over his shoulder to his elbow and collarbone and half of his right shoulder blade.  The pattern is repeatative and if he were to weave it would form a flattened 'fireball'.

Nox is placed with a family with in the CCB as he gets on his feet.  (Paul and Elizabeth Snider - Sita, 6 and Michael, 15). He gets a job doing crap work at a local mechanic (Bill Brown) with another of the CCB members.  Nox's ideas about the Venatori and how the CCB can change things makes waves and he eventually gets in good with James and Charles.  He learns of all the plans they have against the Venatori.  Including sending Levi in, Using Garrett to control/change him and to eventually put a figure head leader in the Venatori (him), and their new plan to bomb the facility.

Elaina and Nox have an intament moment.

Nox voices his concern about bombing the building and all the innocent lives.  This throws tension between Nox and the leaders of the CCB.  His voice could carry weight now - they can't have dissent.

Elaina tries to stand up for Nox and their moment is revealed to Charles and he gets angry just as Garrett shows up scared and has plenty to say about Nox.  James puts Charles in charge of killing Nox for his herasy.  The first squad of were creatures doesn't come back.

A second with Charles in charge go after Nox.  Everyone but Charles dies, and Charles only narrowly escapes Nox due to his supernatural speed.

Nox takes the fight to them and kills both James and Charles in front of the CCB that were present in their 'hideout'.

Nox becomes 'king' of the CCB - like most other supernatural organizations whether big or small, killing the top makes you top - undisputed.

# Evolution

Nox returns to the Venatori to report back the end of the terror on the Venatori.  Nox remains Exuli on the records but he is taken back inside the Venatori as the 'bridge' between the CCB (and other supernatural creatures) and the Venatori to insight change.

(This one should focus on the Evolution of the Venatori in strucutre as well as the evolution of their blood lines)

Nox's children should be born.  This changes him in drastic ways.

Dorian and Nox find a connection through Aidan.  Nox picks right back up with Aidan and Drake.  Dorian struggles to be the father he wants to be where as Nox does it easily in Dorian's eyes.  At first Dorian is jealous, but soon finds Nox is helping push Aidan towards him as father and helping him become a better father.  Dorian starts seeing Nox for the man he is and not the little boy he was.

Nox's life is in danger as radicals from both sides take matters into their own hands.  Several attempts on his life are made and if not for his unique ability to rapidly 'heal' he would have died.  The question arises is he immortal?
