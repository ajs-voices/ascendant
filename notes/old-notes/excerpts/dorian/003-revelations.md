Dorian's PoV with Nox and Levi

****

The next day one of my charges was in my office needing yet another mentor.  Levi was a talented young man.  Gifted for not being trained.  He tested high in all the elements and I suspected he was Cesari but there really was no way to prove it if he refused to cooperate with things.

He was on mentor number 3.  He was troublesome but I hated to erase such potential.  And with Nox back in town for the forseeable future maybe he would be the perfect mentor for this boy.  I had Levi sitting in a testing room all morning because I had no other place for him.  He was too far out of touch with kids his age and too old for the younger classes.  But he was a smart kid if he'd just put his head to it.  It reminded me very much of Nox as a child.

I went in search of the one person I had vowed to avoid.  But it seemed that my life revolved around his.  My career thrived because of his ability.  My knowledge only grew when I watched him.  I don't think I would get away from him so easily.

I visited my mother since I was in her neck of the woods.  She informed me that the young man had just left to go see Nicholas Hampton.  Kai wouldn't exactly like that.  And I had just seen him entering the building.  I hurried to the infirmary.  I took the stairs.  He didn't like elevators and I knew I wouldn't miss him if I did.

Nox almost literally ran into me going down as I was going up.  I smiled up at him.  He was towering over me his already six foot height and the added height of the stairs made me feel smaller than I was.  He stepped away.  I told him I was coming to warn him.  Which was true but I had been looking for him prior to that too.

He announced he'd been talking to Nick, which meant to me that he actually knew his brother. Something tugged at my memory as I asked about his familiariaty with him.  They were only months apart in age.  They'd gone to school together and Nox confirmed my suspicion that they'd known each other and then that nagging feeling became real.  He'd been caught in the halls making out with Nick.  The two brothers hadn't known about each other and both were fond of the same sex.  Awkward.

Even Nox commented on the fact now that he knew and Nox was the least likely of anyone I knew to be awkward about his sexuality.

Nox was clearly unhappy about the games the Venatori played with his life.  I honestly didn't blame him as I told him why I thought things had happened the way they were.  I had known Nox's parentage.  Maybe I should have told him.  Would it have changed things?  

I had other things to deal with right now.  "I have a favor to ask of you."  I asked Nox.  
I told Nox about Levi.  He hardly hesitated in responding.  He trusted me.  And I started to wonder if he really should.  He asked me when and I could only grin at him.  Before I could say anything he had indicated he could go now.  

I knew he was in the middle of a case, but this was just as important - at least to the future of this boy it was.

We walked side by side down the hall.  The silence was slightly unnerving but it was good to be comfortable.  He wasn't trying to be more than a collegue right now and I could handle that.  He didn't look the frightened child but I could still see him standing there with fear in his eyes.  

But just as I was getting comfortable with the silence Nox spoke and the tension from before came into my body.  I could feel the desire I had for him - but it was beyond wrong.  He was a student, a boy I'd watch grow up.  How could I do anything with him - be anything more than a mentor to him.  I was having a hard time wrapping my head around him.

He changed the subject for which I was eternally grateful and I told him about Levi.

We were soon at the testing room I'd left Levi in.  I opened the door and introduced the two.  I started reminding Levi of the ramifications of failure this time.  Nox cut me off short.  I nodded and left the two young men together.

I went into the adjoining room where I would watch the pair.

I missed Nox's performance as he sat in the chair.  I could clearly see he was leaning in the chair with air holding him steady.  Levi clearly knew he wasn't balancing but he couldn't see.  Nox prodded at him and tried to show him things.

I watched as Nox sat with Levi and talked through things.  Nox was connecting with the boy.  They were talking about girlfriends and boyfriends, Nox's upbringing and his mother, how he saw the patterns.  I was amazed at how well Nox took to being a mentor.  Nox started a different direction and was looking around the room.  Levi was strong in water - Nox's weakest element.  Nox could easily create water from nothing but that defeats the purpose. 

I got up and took him a bottle of water.  Nox beamed up and me and I was happy to see the wide smile.  It was such a rare occurance.  I left and went looking for the supply box for testing and left the box just inside the door as Nox continued with his lessons with Levi.

Levi was as touchy as Nox was.  They both came from similar situations.  Families who were gone because of their gift.  Nox's lived while Levi's hadn't, but Nox had to live with the fact that his mother hadn't wanted him.  It was part of the reason why I had taken such an interest in him as a boy.  I didn't understand, and I still don't, how a parent could dismiss their child so throughly and completely.  He was a lovely child.   Annoying and stubborn and troublesome, but if he'd had parents maybe that wouldn't have been the case.  

He went on to how he knew the kid was Cesari.  I couldn't help but be curious I needed to know.  I opened the intercom, "How do you know Nox?"

He looked up at me through the plate glass mirror as if he could really see me.  His chocolate brown eyes gazing through staring at me but I knew he could only see his reflection but that didn't change the effect it had on me.  I swallowed hard and pushed away the feelings as he told me the differences between everyone else and what he saw with Levi.

I'd wished I'd thought to ask him how he saw things before.  Maybe things would be different now.  I could have seen things before. 

Nox was true to his word and he got up to take Levi to one of Jason's classes.  It would be good for both of them.

Dae'lin was waiting outside she'd heard the last bit about the cesari and she was just as eager to learn about things like that as I was. 

I watched Nox leave and I still had this feeling like I needed to know more about the way he saw things.  And I didn't want Dae'lin's way getting in the way of things.

I knew the plan was for Nox to jump for Jason's class.  I waited at the ground level alley way door for Nox to show up.  I couldn't keep my mind from all the questions I had.  The topic was fascinating.

He say me and grinned, "Hey."

I smiled back, "Hey back.  You enjoy that?" I knew he had.  He was glowing.  

"It's almost heaven."

I had to know the what heave was if jumping was almost heaving.  But his reply left me blushing.  How could this boy have this effect on me even when I knew exactly how he was.  

I don't know what possessed me as I touched his arm.  There was a small stab of electricity.  I don't know if it was all in my head or if it was just static but I felt something and I pulled my hand away almost as fast as I had touched him.  He seemed to notice my reaction.  "I'd really like to talk about what you see."

Nox gave me a half grin, he was hiding behind it, "Whenever you want."  He went on to say he could rearrange his schedule however needed.

We agree to later that night after the dinner meeting with Stella and Dae'lin to discuss the employment of my ex-girlfriend and the mother of my half human son.  What were the odds but it had happened.
