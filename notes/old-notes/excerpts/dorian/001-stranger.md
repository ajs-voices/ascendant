Dorian's PoV of meeting Nox for the first time after he's graduated.

****

Everything in the Academy was going head over heels crazy.  Explosions in the dormintories, explosions in the class rooms.  There were even explosions randomly in the halls.  A half dozen kids and two young adults had been injured in the explosions.  None of the kids save one could even see a pattern if he dared look.  And Nicholas Hampton was not exactly the most observant boy around.  His father was up in arms - rightfully so.  Dae'lin was pulling in hunters from across the globe to figure this one out.  Claimed to even be pulling in an expert.  Which if I thought about it too long made the least sense.  She already had the leading experts in patterns working with her.  

I don't claim to be the best at reading them, but it's part of my job and to have some stranger come in was certainly chapping my hide, but I let it go, let it slide off of me and pretend like it didn't matter.  Her expert was due to arrive anytime, he was running late.  That was not going to go over well.  Tardiness was the least of the things Dae'lin got angry over.  I didn't feel any pity for the man.

That was until I saw Dae'lin dragging him to the fishbowl literally by his ear.  Her five foot stature was nothing when she was angry.  The man was nearly bent in two as Dae'lin pulled him into the conference room.  He looked like he'd been out in the field far too long - though his attire was clean, he could use a decent shave.  He was uncharacteristically defined for being of a slight build; it spoke to his athletecism. It wasn't odd for a hunter to live in the gym when not on a mission.  Clearly this man did.

I should have stopped there.  But my eyes wandered.  He was attractive. His mussy hair styled to perfection.  He looked pale under Dae'lin's scrutiny as I walked in.  "Don't you think you should scold him later, Dae'lin.  Certainingly not in front of his peers?"  

He had been staring at the ground when I walked in and I watched his eyes trail up my body to meet my gaze.  I could feel the intensity of his stare.  His eyes were striking and I almost found myself lost in them.  I introduced myself to the handsome stranger, "Dorian Vega."

A grin splayed across his face and I had to fight my own from showing.  He laughed softly, it reverberated in my soul.  Where there had been fear in his eyes before, it was now replaced with humor, like he knew a joke and no one else got it.  He offered me his hand and I took his long slender fingers in my own.  My mind started to wander at his touch but I was snapped back to reality as he spoke.  "Nox Sétanta."  He chuckled again as I fought the overwhelming 'oh shit' that tried to escape my mouth.

Thankfully Nox turned heel and walked around to the other side of the table.  I barely had time to think before I sat down.  How I wished I could avoid eye contact.  But that was rude and Dorian Vega was anything but rude.

How was it that I didn't recognize the boy that I'd watched his entire life?  The one who had made my career?  The only child to ever come through the Academy that I had guided from day one.  

I could see it now, in his smile, his eyes, in the way he sat in the chair.  But as he spoke my body reacted in ways it should not.  He caressed my desire and I had to surpress every eager feeling I had.  This was not a man with whom I could even try to have a romantic relationship; the idea was repulsive but yet I reacted to him.

How could I have a relationship with a child who was 13 years my junior.  But it wasn't his age that bothered me, I had slept with his best friend for three months before Jason's wife finally wrangled him in.  It wasn't his age.  No, this was a child that I'd seen grow from scared little boy to the man he was now.  Guiding his education and insuring that he was never overwhelmed.  I still saw that scared little boy latching on to my leg in the elevator whenever I looked at him.

I pushed all thoughts of Nox Sétanta from my mind and stayed on topic.  I kept my voice neutral as I told Nox of the problem as I saw it.  Which in essense boiled down to we had a rogue Cesari.  I have a photographic memory, why hadn't I thought about the boy being Dae'lin's expert?  He was the only Cesari capable of understanding half of this.  Even Mark Green - the most powerful Cesari before Nox - had issues understanding how something like this was possible.

Kai had certainly been in a huff over this and it all made sense now.  Nox wasn't exactly the greatest asset the Venatori employed, but he certainly was the least liked by nearly everyone here.  There were a handful of people who liked the boy - myself included but I certainly hadn't thought of him like that before...  I was going to have to keep my head around him if my body continued to betray me.

The meeting came to a close and Nox started to leave.  I still had information to give him.  I stopped him as he walked by, placing my folder of files in his path and my hand brushed the jacket he was wearing.  A shiver ran down my spine that I hoped he never noticed.  I cursed myself with a smile on my face.  I stood up.  He'd specifically stopped close my shoulder ran up the length of his body.  Why didn't I just stay seated?  Now my brain was overriding my logic...

"All my files on Cesari and what we know of the explosions."  He took the folder from my hand, his finger tips touching my fingers as he took it with a wide smile.  I could get lost in his smile.  Fuck! I focused on his eyes, but saw his lush lips as I moved up.  He was grinning like a mad man.  It felt like forever before he said, "Thanks."

He stepped around me and I missed his touch.  How could this boy make me act like a foolish child again?  "If you've any questions just let me know."

Damn it!  Why did I say that?  I don't need to be around him anymore than necessary.  Fool.

I turned away from him, but before I knew it I was watching him leave.  I would say he almost made it a show just for my eyes, but I noticed a flock of girls waggling their tongues and giggling as he threw them a flourished bow.  He turned around and grinned at me and waved the file folder in front of him before departing around the corner.

I forced myself out of the fishbowl and through the cooridor and down the hall.  I had a test to give to a new student.  This meeting had taken longer than I'd have liked and I didn't want to be late.

I rushed past the adjoining hall and had to turn around and glance back down the hallway.  If it had been two students in the hallway I'd have stopped and stepped in, but Kai Viddens was not someone I wanted to be on the bad side of - particularly right now.  

Kai held his son up against the wall and was yelling.  Nox could handle himself.  He had always done well against the bullies as a child.  He could handle his own father. I hoped as I walked away.  I had to be else where. And the last thing I needed was Nox Sétanta playing havoc with my head anymore than he already had.
