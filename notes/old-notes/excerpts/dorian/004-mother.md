Dorian's Pov about his mother's death

****

You'd think the world was conspiring against me.  I heard the fire sirens go off.  It wasn't the first time since this whole thing began that they had gone off.  But I knew exactly what it was and I got up from my desk and started for the stairs.  I listened to the pattern and my heart stopped.  The floor and general location was that of my parents living quarters.  

What had started as a casual walk was no longer that.  I ran up the stairs and I wasn't the only one.  There were others there.

I rounded the corner to see Kai yelling at a man while my father leaned against the wall.  Fuck!  Where was my mother?  Eli?  Sahara?  

Kai stopped me from looking inside my parent's apartment, he violently pushed me away.  "Go see your father.  I got this."

I blinked at him confused.  But I listened and I went to my father and he wrapped his arms around me.  While it wasn't a first it had been a long time since my father felt comfortable enough with my choices to be seen holding me even though I was his son.  

I hugged my father and he squeezed me tightly.  My father whispered to me, "Son of a bitch killed your mother."

I held my father from my at arms length, if he was joking this was not funny.  But I could tell that he wasn't and I pulled him back into my embrace and held him tightly.

The universe was shitting on us now.  It was not only taking children with bright futures it was now taking our brightest leaders.  It was time for this bastard to be caught.

I was numb to everything.  My sister showed up just as I saw him again.  He was everywhere.  There was no escaping the boy who was tugging at parts of me that he shouldn't.  He was watching us and gave us a sad smile, he had work to do but he looked like he wanted to make sure we were okay.  Family had never been something he was good at - not having one of his own.

I was lost.  My mother was my everything.  Of all the family who had accepted me for all my successes and faults it was her.  Never once did she look down upon my choices even the ones about who I slept with.

What was I going to do?  But I couldn't show weakness.  Not now and definately not here.  My father was greiving.  My family needed a strong shoulder to cry on.  I could be that.  I had to.

My father straigthened himself and dried his tears.  He patted Sahara on the shoulder and  nodded to me and started for the door.  He was going to be strong too.  He'd given it his five minutes, and now it was time to man up and do his job.  

I took a deep breathe and did the same.  I found myself in the doorway that I had graced often before but now it was wrong.  Nox and Kai were discussing dissipating patterns.  "Is it your limit?"

Nox shook his head and explained what he thought the issue was.  He was likely right.  He knew his ability best, even better than I do.  And once again I wondered why I never had spoken to him about it - only observed.

Nox left Kai and headed towards me.  He was quiet and I could see he was sad for us - greiving for us.  He gave his condolenses in a hushed whisper before he took my hand and pulled me away from the crowd.  

In that moment I hadn't cared that he was being forward.  He was comforting me in a way he knew I could tolerate, how much did he understand about me that I hadn't known?  He offered if If I needed anything.  I wanted to curl up and cry for the loss of my mother.  I don't know why I thought he would let me, or why it felt right.  But I'd know he'd lost his mother recently.  Not that he'd ever known her really.  He was essentially alone most of his life and he was offerent to be strong for me and my family - why?

But I didn't want to be alone tonight and there wre things we could talk about.  Things we could do to take the sting of life away.  I found it odd in the strange fog of loss that I would even consider it when in my normal function I would not.  But he was strong and capable and attractive and willing... I asked him if our plans still stood.  

Nox happily agreed, "Later it is then."

I watched as my father stepped in beside Nox and they went off talking business.  My father was a trooper.  I looked back towards my parents place and frowned.  There was nothing there for me to do so I went to my office.  I was empty of everything as I sailed through the remainder of my day.
