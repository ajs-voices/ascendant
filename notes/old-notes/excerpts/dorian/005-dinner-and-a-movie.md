Dorian's PoV of going to dinner with Nox, the trip to the roof and ultimately the night they spend together.

****

It was late.  I'd been back from my dinner meeting with Stella and Dae'lin for at least an hour.  Things were busy down in HQ.  All the venatori were off doing things and I was sitting in my office when the tall frame of Nox passed by my window.  He was leaving the floor - heading in the direction of his room.  

I could forget what I'd asked of him.  But I truly did not want to be alone - lost in my own head for the night.  My initial reaction had wained but he was still willing and we could talk.  There was so much I wanted to talk about with him.  And it was distracting enough.

I closed up my office and headed in the direction of the temporary rooms and found Nox's door wide open.  I knocked.  "Nox you in here?"

He called out from somewhere inside.  He welcomed me inside and I stepped inside and saw his room was throughly trashed.  The raid on his room had not been easy on his things.  I stood in the door frame of his bathroom and watched as he meticulously foldeed the towels and placed them in the linen closet before he leaned against the door and ungracefully shifted his weight when the door moved.  I tried to feign a smile to be happy but I knew it was quickly fading and he could see through me.    Nox was characteristically himself with a joke about my treatment under the circumstances.  

He walked into the apartment and i followed him.  I picked up a few shirts on the floor and noticed the saying on one.  I shouldn't have looked - should have known there would be lewd and crude sayings on near every one of them.

Nox claimed to be hungry and his stomac hearlded his claim by rumbling loudly.  "I offered a place - a place I could have a bottle of wine that was decent.  There was no telling where he'd head off to left to his own mind.  Thankfully he agreed with more jokes to follow.

I tossed Nox the shirts I had picked up.  "Nice shirt."   

He glanced at it and snickered.  "One of my favorites."

I smirked.  It was funny but it wasn't and it rather hit home at the moment.  My need for human contact seemed to be on the rise again as I recited the words on the shirt.  It was not something that I would normally be heard saying and I knew that color rose quickqly as I tried to hid it.

We left his room and I was following, but I turned for the stairs instead of the elevator and Nox commented.  I told him the truth.  I took the stairs because I didn't like his reaction to the elevator.  And right now, I didn't really want to be reminded of the little boy I kept seeing.  I wanted to see the man he grew into, wanted to feel  something because since the explosion went off earlier today I had been walking around like a zombie.

I was on autopilot as we chatted about the elevator and Levi.  By the time we were outside and waiting the next train we were in a comfortable silence.  Nox was lost in his own thoughts, either that or he was content letting me alone in my own.

We climbed on board the train, for the hour it was packed - standing room only.  I took one of the straps and held on.  Nox was not prepared and reached up and grabbed the same strap I had and the momentum from the car pressed our bodies together.  It was intoxicating being this close to him.  I whispered "I didn't plan this honest."

His response I should have expected, he laughed and said he wouldn't have minded if I had planned it all out.  That took too much forsight.  Something I was lacking today - and clearly lacking around him.

I pulled myself together as we got off the train.  I wanted to see the man for what he was, but the idea that he was still that little boy kept creeping into my mind.   I headed for Pellegrino's.  I knew Nox could likely not afford the establishment but I wanted a good bottle of wine and I would pay for it.

The hostest Marie greeted me and lead us to another table in the back.  Even here was packed.  I was still dressed for a place like this but Nox in his jeans, t-shirt and hoodie was not.  At least the t-shirt lacked a crude saying.  I was thankful for that.

I picked up the menu and asked Nox if he had any preferences in wine and when he answered he was a beer kinda guy I felt guilty.  I offered to go some place else, but he said he missed good Italian food.  Well at least that was what they had here.

"I am Miguel, I will be your server today.  Can I start you off with anything?"  

Finally I ordered Sauvignon Blanc and added I'd wait for desert.  But I did mention picking at whatever Nox ordered.  To which Nox playfully grinned at me "As if I'm sharing."

He looked to Nox and the boy flirted.  Which didn't go overwell with our waiter as he frowned.  Nox ordered excellent choices and I told him so.  To his credit he had dialed back his flirting.  I knew he was always outgoing, always flamboyant with his choices - particularly when it bothered someone.  It had been another big reason he'd landed in my office more times than not.

Sadly the topic of my father came up and I could feel the sadness creeping in.  We spoke of his mother as well and while I had known of his feelings for Dae'lin and Jason his claim that I was family made me a bit surprised.  I hadn't known I rated so highly on the boy... man's list of friends.

And that didn't sound as good as I'd have liked at this moment.  Family wasn't something you had inappropratie feelings towards.  And I was clearly leaning in that direction.  I spoke of whatever we were playing at and Nox frowned.

The conversation quickly turned in a bad direction.  Nox's reaction was that of anger and from his quick apology my own hadn't been any better in return.  He was just as lost as I was.

I reached across the table to comfort him, it was a gestrue I'd used so often before, it wasn't his fault and I told him so, things were confusing enough without adding  things to it.  But he pulled away from me, telling me I had to stop.

I was confused, "Stop what?"

"Stop touching me that way.  Like there could be more." 

I frowned, "Nox..."  Really what could I say.  He had been flirting with me.  I wanted to tell him what was going on.  What the problem was, but I was feeling things I shouldn't.  He would understand.  But our server came and Nox praised him a bit over the time.  

I apologized for Nox's over exhuberance with his own humor.  It scared the waiter away and Nox was choking on the bread he'd stolen from the basket.  Thigns had just gotten extremely awkward.  I didn't know how to proceed.  This boy was making me feel like I was a teenager and I felt wrong feeling that way.  Completely out of my element.

Nox asked me something and I only comphrehended the fact that he said something.  He repeated himself and I was glad for the topic change - something we had actually both agreed to discuss.

I looked at the patterns he'd asked me to and I could see them faintly dissipating, cooling down.  When I told him he explained.  I was fasinated by his views on patterns around people.  About the changes he had seen.  I'd never really noticed what he'd spoken of.  I'd seen patterns my whole life.  And I'd studied them but apparently I was missing a great deal about them in my narrow approach.  What I saw was not what he saw.  

He mentioned Jason and  I told him he should sit in his class.  I beleive Jason learned alot more from Nox than even Nox knew.  Jason was a weird specimen of talent but he had grown in talent over the last few years.  He'd been earth and air, but now he could touch both water and fire and teach them to the younger generations.  

Somehow we got on to what I could do.  Nox asked if I could manipulate them.  Of course i couldn't I was not Magnus.  Though I likely could have been.  I responded sarcastically and Nox of course had a come back.  His comment made us both uncomfortable but he kept on going and insisted that I could if I tried.  If I only got out of my own way.

He was likely right.  But I was rescued by out server again and I was drinking more wine than I really should.  I could feel the alcohol going to my head.
