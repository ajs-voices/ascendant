Dorian's PoV of finding Nox in the hall way standing before the orange door.

****

The girl who I was testing was nothing special.  She didn't fly through her air test, and she couldn't see anything else to even begin to manipulate it.  She was easy enough to place and I'd finished sooner than I'd planned.

I was finally feeling myself again when I saw him again.  I started to turn down a different hall to avoid him, but noticed Nox was just standing in front of a door.  His tall frame standing completely motionless staring at a regular door.  

I took a few steps in his direction and he never moved, never even noticed me.  For everything in my body I kept walking.  Concern overrode every fiber of my being - he was still that small child who I'd been protecting his whole life.

I stopped as he finally opened the door, he looked lost in thought as I noticed the orange door opening.  I saw a familiar shudder as he stepped inside.  Fear was coursing though the young man's body.  Fear of what lay beyond that door.

I remembered a time he refused to go into one of the firestarter rooms alone.  He closed the door behind him.  I should have left, gone on with my day.  But concern for the boy made me follow him inside.  He hadn't even noticed when I opened the door.  He stood there doing nothing.  He stared into nothingness.  I saw fear, and I'd never seen this kind of fear on Nox's face before.  

I put my hand on his shoulder and he jumped. A strangled cry crept from his lips and as quickly as it had come it passed as he turned to look at me.  I had taken a step back the moment he'd jumped.  There was no telling what he would do if startled - he was Cesari and he was frightened.

Nox turned away from me and I saw him wipe away the tears that had started to silently fall.  He started throwing countless fireballs across the room.  It was something I could watch all day.  The way the patterns formed above his hand and threw them across the room, the patterns shattering and then dissapaiting.  It was not awe in the boy, not necessarily, it was awe in the ease of which he did it.

But the silence started to grow uncomfortable.  I was about to walk out when he asked "Can I help you?"  He sounded distant and far away - lost in some memory or another.

I couldn't leave, not while he sounded like that.  I pulled a chair over and sat down.  I told him the truth, I had just seen him standing outside looking lost.

His response was right on.  He did look haunted.  Ghosts from his pasts.  "Do you want to talk about it?"  Nox had always talked to me before, things should be no different now.  Even after three years, he was still someone I would watch out for.  Maybe that was the problem with everything.

Nox shook his head.  He didn't want to talk about it.  I knew he'd been seeing his therapist still even after he'd been cleared for duty.  It was something he did of his own.  I asked him if he'd talked to Dr. Silverman about it.  She was the one person who should know.  It was clearly upsetting him but he was grown man now.  There was nothing I could do or say that would make him do anything now that I had no power over him.

And then out of the blue he says he came to throw fireballs because of his father.  I had to laugh at that.  "I saw that too."  I hadn't been following him.  But it felt like it now.

Nox turned to look at me.  His face was puffy and red and he looked like he'd been crying.  It was hardly a look you see on a grown man, but all I could see was the little boy I'd know for years.  He asked, "Are you still watching over me?"  He smiled, but I knew it was forced.  The flame in his hand dnanced in his eyes and I knew that whatever I said next was not going to be what he wanted to hear.

But I smiled at him.  The same smile I held for him all these years.  "You are cesari."  Of course I watched out for him.  But as I'd predicted the hope in his eyes vanished and was replaced with anger.  He turned and started throwing fireballs again.  I stood up and closed the distance between us I couldn't leave it like that.  "I care what happens to you Nox.  As every other child here.  I continue to keep tabs on you because you are cesari.  It does not change the fact that I care."  

But I knew from the way he stood that my words were only making things worse.  I had theories about why Nox was here, why the fear had bubbled to the surface.  The orange door sending fear through his body.  I took a deep breath and started, "I will tell you what I think all this is then.  I think the orange door reminded of what Garret did to you behind the veil here."

I watched him crumble.  His breathing stopped, fear was evident on his face.  The pattern of fire he had been about to throw died in his hand.  I put him hand on his shoulder, "Breathe, Nox."

Nox gasped for air and fell to his knees.  It came out a whisper I could barely hear, "What do you know?"

I sat down next to Nox on the floor it was cold but right now I was concerned for him.  There was a ton of guilt rolling around inside me.  Things I should have seen, should have known, but I never did.  I put my hand on his knee.   I only wanted to comfort the child that had once been in my office so long ago - afraid and alone.  "I don't know anything.  I suspect a great many things.  Garrett did something to you.  You set him on fire.  That is all I know.  But I know you wouldn't have done that without some reason."

Things only got worse.  Nox pulled in on himself, he sat down and wrapped himself up in his long arms.  My heart ached for him.  I wanted to comfort him.  But I stayed my ground.  

Nox whispered, "He beat me."

I stopped breathing for a moment.  It was just as bad as I had thought it was.  I wanted to wrap my arms around him.  I wanted to comfort him to tell him it would be alright.  But he was a grown man.  And he despised being pittied.  It was one thing that had got him sent to my office more times than once.  Nox rarely started the fight, but when he did that was one time he did.

I told Nox the truth.  "I moved you from him when I suspected but I couldn't pin anything on him."

We sat there for a countless amount of time.  Eventually Nox's tears stopped falling and he sat up and put on his bravado, the grin he always wore was back.  "Was there something I could help you with?"

I couldn't bounce back like he did, but I smiled anyway.  I knew it looked fake and he would too.  I repeated what I'd told him before and he gave me a half smile "You said that already."  Then he stood up and took a deep breath, "I'd rather anyone else not know."

"Of course not."  I nodded.  I had a great many secrets of Nox SÃ©tanta's.  And I had no intention of sharing this one.  I put my hand on his shoulder and nodded, "If you need to talk, Nox.  My door will always be open."

He nodded and turned away from me.  I could tell that he wanted more - more was not something I could give him.  I left the boy I knew fighting his demons in the room because I couldn't be what he wanted me to be.  

Now it made things even worse - knowing what I know.  That I should have stopped something from happening under my nose.  How could I let this happen.  But yet I did everything I could for him.  And I had continued until the day he graduated.
