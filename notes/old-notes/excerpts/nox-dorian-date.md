**** Nox

My room was a disaster.  My clothes from my bag was strewn across the floor and bed.  My backpack full of camping gear was dumped unceremoniously on my bed and scattered everywhere.  My gun was lying out in plain sight with the door wide open.

I picked it up and stuffed it back into the bottom of my duffle bag.  Out of sight was far better than being left open.  

Every cupboard was thrown open, the fridge door was swinging on the hinge.  Thankfully it was empty.  Even the bathroom cabinetes had been emptied and all the nice fluffy white towels were discarded on the floor in a heap.

I started there.  I picked up the towels and started folding them neatly to put them back in the cabinent.  I held one to my face, they smelled clean and slightly of cedar.  They'd been recently pulled from storage I surmised.

A knock came at my door and I called out, "Come on in to the disaster area."

**** Dorian 

Since I'd left my parents apartment I'd been walking in a daze.  The world was hazy and I just wanted to have a drink.  A nice tall glass of wine and to curl up in my bed with the warmth of someone else.  Sadly none of that was likely to happen.  The only prospect at the moment was a boy who had grown into a man that I found attractive.  Not just any boy - Nox SÃ©tanta.  The one boy who I had paid most attention to.  He was what made my career thrive.  He was the one with whom I vowed to protect because no one else would.  I didn't think of him like others.

I was still in my office at this late hour because I didn't want to go home and be alone.  I had also said I would meet that prospect to talk about something we both shared in common interest - patterns.  But Nox was busy ferretting out the person behind the death of my mother.

There was nothing left to do but go home now, I'd caught up on all the work.  Just as I was leaving I saw Nox walk past.  He was alone and not walking the direction everyone else was.  He was going to his rooms.  I could at least see if he were still up to talking.

I closed up my office and headed up to his rooms.  The door was wide open.  

I knocked and he called for whoever to enter.  What if I was the bad guy, he was so oblivious sometimes.  I walked in and leaned against the door frame.  

Nox's tall frame was standing near the sink folding towels like it was an everyday thing.  

I glanced around his room and noticed the disaster he'd mentioned. I didn't think he was that poor of a house keeper, the search for their killer must have made a mess of his room.  It made me wonder the state of my own apartment.

**** Nox

Dorian stood in the doorway to my bathroom watching me.  I couldn't help the smile that splayed on my face.  "Seems they did a thorough trashing of my room."

I finished folding the last of the towels and placed them in the cabinent they'd been so carelessly thrown from and waved my had for Dorian to walk into the studio proper.  I could have squeezed past him but I didn't think he'd appreciate the forwardness.  He hadn't recipocated in any fashion before.  I pushed the thoughts away. This wasn't about what I wanted.  It was about Dorian and what he needed.  He wanted a distraction.  I could provided that.

I walked into my kitchen and closed the open fridge with a sigh, "I'm starving and I have nothing here.  Care if we grab something to eat out side the compound?"

**** Dorian

I nodded, "Sure.  I know a good place, if you don't mind?"

I glanced around and shook my head.  "You sure you don't want to clean up first?"  I know I would want to.  Just standing here was driving my neat freak streak crazy. "There may not be time later?"

**** Nox

Wherever Dorian wanted to go was fine with me.  I was easy, I was just hungry.  My stomach rumbled in response.

I chuckled to myself. "Well.  As much as the mess is driving me nuts, I'm hungry."

Dorian nodded and I waved him out the door and closed it behind me, making sure to lock it.  Dorian headed for the stairs and I laughed, "We can take the elevator."

**** Dorian

I glanced at Nox.  He was finding humor in my actions.  I suppose when you were used to taking the stairs it was nothing, but he didn't like the elevator.  All I saw when I took the elevator with him was a small child latching on to my leg burying his face in my pants and trying to be brave.

I didn't want to see that now.  I wanted to be with the man that he'd grown into so I continued towards the stairs and told half the truth, "I don't like the reaction it envokes in you."  

I opened the door for Nox and lead him through.  It was habit, it was customary for the gentleman to be like that.  I didn't think about it as the door closed behind me and we started down the stairs.

The echo of our footsteps and our breathing were the only sounds in the empty stair well.  The silence was almost comfortable but I felt awkward walking next to Nox, next to the kid I'd always saw him as.

I caught him stealing glances in my direction.  He was just as uncomfortable as I was.  The air between us grew thick with tension.  I took a deep breath and asked a random question on my list of things to understand.  "The patterns around people.  How long have you seen them?  Why didn't you ever say anything?"

**** Nox

I was thankful Dorian decided to say something.  Listening to him breathe was not exactly doing anything for my desire for him.   I wanted to be there for him, really I did but he smelled divine - he always did.  

We walked down the stairs and I shrugged, "Ever since you told me to look for them that first day."

Dorian stopped mid stair case and stared down at me with a look that said 'Really?'

I grinned up at him.  "Yes.  Really.  I didn't know really what was going on till years later though.  And it wasn't until my last few years that I could interpret things."

Dorian took a step down shaking his head and when he reached my step I started back down with him.  "No one ever asked me what I saw.  I didn't know it was different.  How was I to know I was different?"

**** Dorian

I was dumbfounded.  He'd been seeing the patterns differently without any assistance since day one and no one had bothered to ask him what he saw.  I would have to make a point of it from now on.  Assumptions always bit you in the butt later on.

Nox was right, how was he to know he was different - he was five.  I nodded.  "So explain it now.  What do you see around me?"  I knew that it meant having his chocolate gaze staring at me as we walked, but I was curious, far more curious to know what he thought and saw than I was worried about my own libido or his.  And he didn't seem to mind talking about himself or things he saw.  That never seemed to be his problem even as a child.  If there was one thing Nox could be counted on to talk about it was himself.

We had reached the final landing and I opened the door.  Nox stepped through before he started speaking.  I place my hand on the small of his back as I had nearly every time before, with every other person and in every other circumstance.  I felt his reaction to my touch and I thought to myself that I shouldn't do that again.  But I knew that my gentlemanly habits would likely make me forget that the next time a door presented itself to us.

**** Nox

Dorian's hand at the small of my back sent a shiver through my body and I hurried through.  I didn't look at him.  I already knew the patterns around him, though they had changed over the past three years.

I walked in silence out through the large glass doors past the statue I'd created when I was 10.  I smiled fondly at it as I passed.  It wasn't until the cool night air was on my skin that I looked at Dorian.  The crisp air wisked his scent away from me and I was thankful but also saddened.  I enjoyed the comfort it provided.  

I could see him shift uncomfortably underneath my gaze but he'd asked.  I looked down and grinned to myself.  "You've changed.  You've been listening to Jason's theories.  Once upon a time air pulled in faintly.  But now, they all pull in just as faintly.  Air, earth, fire and water almost as equally.  You could always see the patterns.  Now I think you can touch them all if you tried."

**** Dorian

I shook my head.  It wasn't that I didn't beleive him, I didn't want to.  I was not Magnus.  I could be taught but my skill level was so low I wasn't worth teaching.  Barely a 1 if that.  I never had bothered.  The council allowed my untrained eye to go unnoticed because I had a keen knack for placing the children.  Or they wouldn't have even let me go from the Academy without teaching me and then I'd have become Tacet as I had no skill what-so-ever in anything related to weaving a pattern.  

And now the most powerful Cesari I had ever met, the only one in the Uninted States and probably the only one living who could do what he did was telling me I could touch all the elements like it was nothing.  It was all hard to take in.  

We walked in silence until we turned down into the subway stairwell.  And then we continued past the turn-stiles still in silence.  I was lost in my own thoughts.  But the company was at least companionable.  Nox was not the child I remembered.  He wasn't even the teenager I remembered.  Somewhere he grew up, filled out - became the man who walked beside me grinning to himself.

"Something amusing?"  

**** Nox

I watched as the gears turned in Dorian's head.  He'd always been one to get lost in his thoughts even when he was punishing me.  He'd stare off into space and then return with a calm look - like he'd never gone anywhere.  

I knew I was grinning, it was rather a default mode, but today I was enjoying watching Dorian and pretending that I wasn't doing even that.  I enjoyed watching him breathe, the way he walked, the small twitch of his hand that betrayed his discomfort brought be back to myself and his question.

I looked at him with the grin still on my face and shook my head.  "Just watching you think."  I lied, "I can imagine what you were thinking."  But the train rattled up to a stop and talking was pointless at that moment.  I followed Dorian inside the train car.  It was already packed.  We found a spot standing near the back.  

Dorian had reached up and took the plastic strap that hung from the railing above.  I hadn't secured any means of safety when the car lurched forward and found myself pressed against Dorian's side with the thin silver pole between us.  I wrapped my fingers around it and pulled myself away from the man who's scent was haunting me even now.  I wanted to lean in and kiss his neck.  But I turned away and stared out the window and watched the subterrainian light flash by.  I could feel his warmth.  I wanted to touch him, to taste him.
