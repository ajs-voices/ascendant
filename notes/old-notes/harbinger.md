Notes:

<strike>Garrett requests Nox to accompany him to a CCB meeting</strike> where Nox meets the leaders and hears the CCB speak meets some regular folks.

Kai and Emilio are still hunting the Bernstein vampire and Nox has some cases that look similiar and beleives is a set up.

Nox finally gets permission to see Jo, Lori and the others.  

<strike>The full moon is near and Nox is allowed to sit with her at night - she turns successfully with his help. (full moon July 31st - Friday)</strike>

Someone contacts Nox from the CCB about helping a kid in trouble. (Young born werewolf who was adopted with in the community but wasn't aware what type he was and the kid received no help is being hunted by the Venatori.)

After the CCB hears of Nox's helping Jo, the young boy and the vampires being framed the CCB think they have an ally and approach Nox to be their puppet leader of the Venatori - asking him to kill Mark Green.

Nox tells Dorian but asks him not to do anything, but he does anyway.  He goes behind Nox's back and he and others formulate a plan.

Nox refuses.  Garrett attempts to persuade Nox, but Nox finishes what he started when he was six - leaving Garrett to his fate of burning to death.

Knowing the CCB won't stop asking him Nox tells Dorian of his plan to exile himself from the Venatori so he is no longer more powerful than the current leader of the Venatori.  This pushes Dorian's group into action.  (Asher gets involved at this point he doesn't want to lose his access to the new Ascendant.)

When Nox goes to make his scene that will exile him Dorian uses it to push Nox in the same direction the CCB wanted him to go except his method works as Nox is compelled to save Dorian's life from certain death as he starts to challenge Mark Green for leadership.
