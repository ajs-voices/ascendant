I was born in Denver, Colorado and grew up there until I entered high school, at which time we moved to a small town in Upstate New York. Edmeston was not something I was happy with but now I think it was a very good move for me and my family. After high school I went to the State Univeristy of New York at Oneonta for three years before transferring to Polytechnic University at Farmingdale. I graduated from both schools technically in 2000, with a BS in Mathematics and Computer Engineering. Immediately after graduation I started working at Symbol Technologies, Inc. as an Electrical Engineer. I worked there for four years before I moved to Pascagoula, MS where we currently live now.  I am currently working as a Web Developer at Baber's Inc.

I am the mother of two lovely little girls. My husband and I met at dragonmount.com around 1999. Weâ€™ve been married since June 2001.
