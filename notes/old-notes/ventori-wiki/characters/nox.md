Nox Sétanta, MNC5, 22, Dimiaeter (Venatori) (é - Alt+0233)

Meaning of the Name:  Nox is the Goddess of Darkness/Night, Sétanta is the childhood name of Cu Chulainn and was named Ireland's Son of Light

Description:

Nox is 6'0" weighing approximately 145lbs with a hard to maintain thin athletic build. He has chestnut brown hair with chocolate brown eyes framed with a thick set of eye lashes any woman would die for. He tends to sport a five o'clock shadow at any time of the day. Nox almost always has a playful grin plastered on his lips, like everythings a joke to him. He likes to wear t-shirts with obnoxious sayings, he thinks they are funny and doesn't care if you are offended by them. Nox's hands with his long slender fingers are the most defined feature he possess other than his eyes and smile. 

Nox's body is host to a few scars he's more than willing to tell you a false tale about how he got them. (A vampire bite on his right forearm. Claw marks on his left rib cage from a werebear, a slash across his left cheek from the dagger of a ghost possessed human, burn on his right knee from a dragon's flame) 

Nox has a tattoo of the four elements in a colored tribal pattern at the back of his neck just below the base of his skull. The fire symbol is the largest set off to the right side in orange red and yellow flames. On the left at the top is water in varying shades of blue, below that is wind in shades of gray, and finally below that in shades of green is earth all outlined with a thin black line to enhance the color and contrast. During his Ad Aetatem Nox received his tribal tattoo - a pair of crossed swords at his right temple.


Personality:
Nox is loud and it can come off as obnoxious. He is almost always ready with a joke or a one liner. He is self-centered, his charm and his attitude tend to get him noticed and he thrives on being center stage. Nox can make friends where ever he goes, or enemies depending on how they take his infectious attitude. Nox beleives he is not heroic, but his actions speak louder than his words. Nox enjoys the company of either sex. Despite the numerous conquests he is alone and the solitude of his job keep him in a state of depression he coveres with his jovial nature. He has a fear of flying, heights/falling and needles and sometimes clowns. Nox is overzealous with his drink on occassion but prefers to act drunk rather than be drunk but other substances he avoids.

Problem:
Nox's problem is that he has felt like an outcast and unwanted his whole life.

Solution:
Nox's solution is two tiered - the first to push most people way by being fake/always joking etc., the second is when he does let you in he becomes overly attached.

## Biography

### Biographical Facts:

Mother: Leanne Sétanta (human) (Born 1966 - 48 in 2015)
Father: Kai Videns, ENIT4 (Aeternus) (Born 1468 - 547 in 2015)

In 2015 Nox turns 22 years old: Born on Sept 23, 1993
Born in Boulder, Colorado at the Rocky Mountain Venatori Headquarters

Leanne Durante is part of the Venatori, her parents were killed by a rogue werewolf when she was a baby. The Venatori who found her crying and starving in their cabin in the Colorado woods took her in and raised her as one of her own and taught her the way of the Venatori.

Kai Videns has been part of the Venatori his entire adult life. He has had many wives, and many female companions, he has 5 pure blood children and 1 Dimiaeter. Leanne Durante was his female companions in Colorado when he was passing through in 1993 chasing a rogue vampire. Kai was unaware she became with child, and was one of the rare women to survive the birth of Dimiaeter. And no one informed him of his child's birth until the boy was 18 when he went through his Ad Aetatem, as both parents are required in attendance unless deceased.

Nox was born into the Venatori, he started training as soon as he could understand, as all Venatori children are taught.

At the age of 5 Nox started showing signs of being a Magnus like his father, starting random fires - he was designated NNI5 and was started training in the Venatori branch of the Imperordo. This branch is dedicated to teaching Magnus not only the basics of the Order, but also their lot in the Venatori. Only Venatori born with the the gift of a magnus ever joins this branch of the Order. 

Upon arrival in the NYC Venatori Imperordo training center, Nox was tested in all elements as per the usual. He was found to be capable of bending all 4 elements - he was designated NNIAeTA5. (First meets Dorian who preforms the test and Dae'lin who becomes his mentor. - See First Meetings)

The next 4 years Nox spent his time learning each element bending them individually - fire, air, earth and then water.  Dae'lin is his mentor and is routinely frustrated with him.

Nox was quickly becoming an outsider in both the Venatori and the Magnus training programs. Nox is continually picked on my Aaron and his friends.  When Nox is placed in a room with Aaron, Jason and Ross the four boys continue to have issues until 'graduation'. (See Growing Up)

(8 years old) Nox at the suggestion of Dorian starts trying to conquer his fear of heights/falling.  Nox starts testing various heights and jumping.  Jason joins him and soon they are vaulting from rooftops.

(10 years old) His 5th year in the order, he proved to the Order he was cesari by creating a sculpture utilizing all four elements at the same time as an art project for his creativity lessons. The statue sits in the lobby of the Venatori Imperordo training center. He was designated NNC5.  (see Growing Up)

At the age of 10, per the usual testing requirements, Skill mastery is tested. Nox passed into Adept surpassing most his age. He was designated ANC5.  (Dorian preforms the test)

(10 years old) Nox had just finished his testing and was going to talk to Dorian, he followed him around a corner but what he found was more surprising.  He saw Dorian kissing another man sparking a seed for Nox. (SeeGrowing Up)
(10 years old) Nox has his first crush - on a guy.

(10 years old) He started seeking human companions outside the facility by sneaking out and gathering the reputation of not following the rules. He still tried to fit in, but it was a case by case scenario.

At the age of 13 Nox found the company of human women far more pleasing but his dalliances lasted very briefly as he was continually getting into trouble by his superiors and unable to make anything more happen than a night or two of fun without raising suspicions.  He isn't nearly as proliferate with other boys, but he's a few that he had relations with.

At 14 Jason confronts Nox on his 'dreams'.  J and he become friends with benefits so to speak. (Note:  Jason is bi-sexual)

At sixteen while trying to fit in Nox found himself with a bunch of guys (his roommates included) getting drunk, daring one another to do stupid things. They dared Nox to get a tattoo. Being drunk was the only thing that allowed him to surpass his fear of needles.

Risk taking was one of the few things that kept Nox going as an outsider, he started doing things that were considered dangerous. His favorite past time was "sky jumping" - vaulting himself from the heights of the buildings with in New York City with only his magic to catch him at the last moment. (This was an effort to defeat his fear of heights/flying) By the time his Ad Aetatem came he had a cult following of younger magus strong in air trying to preform the same feats. Luckily there had been no deaths prior to his graduation. Afterwards, the practice was forbidden, without Nox's inborn ability to look out for those following him, several boys plummeted to their deaths two months after he left New York City.

(16 years old)  Nox and a bunch of his 'cult following' were about to jump, a few new kids were up on the top of the Venatori building, kids that shouldn't be there.  The headmaster shows up trying to get them all down, citing dangerous etc.  One of the new kids, one strong in air, he was standing next to the edge.  Ross was attempting to push the kid over as a joke.  Nox hadn't noticed Dorian showing up.  He was trying to get Ross to stop when things got a little rough and Dorian  went over the edge.  Nox jumped without thinking and save Dorian.  Once safely on the ground after a very rough landing, Dorian was lying on top of Nox.  Nox kissed Dorian.  Dorian left saying, "Not now, Nox.  Not now."  Leaving Nox wondering what the hell that meant. (See First Kiss)

His status as Dimiaeter moved his final testing to the age of 18. One of the youngest Cesari ever recorded.

(See Nox's Ad Aetatem) The day before his Ad Aetatem Nox met his father Kai. It was as uncerimonious as it sounds. They had dinner and Kai shook Nox's hand before he went back to his hotel to sleep. Nox's mother was disappointed in the reaction. 

Nox saw his father again at the first part of his Ad Aetatem which was the grossest ritual he'd ever seen. Poor rabbit killed for the express purpose of it's intestines wrapped around their wrists only to be severed and the ichor to fall upon the fire beneath it.

The second part was more kind, but less symbolic. The drug they pumped into his veins caused hallucinations. Nox saw things he wished he hadn't seen. He saw the death of his human mother. Saw vague images a man and a woman that would come to mean something to him , Nox wasn't sure what exactly it was, but he had a feeling he already knew these people. The last part of the vision was a kaleidoscope of monsters, small flashes of things with no real meaning to them as Nox understood them..

The third part was the hardest part for Nox. The crossed swords at his temples were tattooed quickly and quietly but Nox's entire body was tense, his breathing was ragged and sweat covered his body by time the two small swords were finished.

His test went smoothly for the Imperordo, not only had it gone smoothly they bumped his skill to Master level instead of Expert. A rare feat by any Magnus. He was designated MNC5 - second highest in all of the Imperordo (consequently 3rd in the Venatori Magnus because he could not lead the Venatori due to age and being Dimiaeter).

As Dimiaeter the blood test indicated he was also Immortal like his father.

Nox has been hunting with the Venatori alone for the past 3 years choosing to be alone. Most of the Aeternus, specifically those in the Venatori see him as an outsider, his birth was rare, his ability is rare, his status as an immortal Dimiaeter as well as his strength all rare.

Nox's first hunt took him to Miami Beach, Florida where his first supernatural creature was of a ghost who had been brutally murdered, at first the vengeful ghost went after only those involved in her murder. However after her revenge was fullfilled her desire to inflict harm had grown and she started haunting innocents. She possed a girl before Nox was able to exorcise her from the body, she cut him with her dagger on his left check - leaving a scar.

6 months after his first hunt was successful Nox found himself back in Colorado hunting a werebear - one that had been stronger, and older than most in the region and his talents had been called upon to defeat the creature after it had turned three innocents and killed a dozen others. In the fight the bear caught him across the ribs on his left before Nox took him out with a fireball that burnt hotter than than any manmade fire could.

A year and 2 months after his turning 18, Nox found himself face to face with a human dragon who was robbing jewelry stores and banks to add to its horde in Hollywood, CA itself - home of everyone's best fantasies. The dragon never took its real form but unbehest to Nox it could still breathe fire that caught him on his right leg, burning through the cloth and causing third degree burns on his outer leg around his knee. While he vaquished the dragon by suffocation it had left enough damange that Nox was hold up for three months healing and going through rehab for the burned knee.

A month after he had fully healed and recoperated enough to be let out in the field Nox went after a kiss of vampires. He managed to take out all but the strongest vampire in a fireball, that one escaped his flames by sheer luck. It launched itself at Nox and took a bite out of his right forearm before Nox chopped of his head with a sword of fire, earth and air.

Once past his breaking point Nox will not see that person again in that fashion, one the trust is broken he has trouble reestablishing that connection.

30. What is the most significant romantic encounter of your character’s past?
    He hasn't had any significant romantic encounters.  He has significant sexual experiences that shape his life but they are far from romantic.  He was raped as well as physically abused as a child - he does not remember most of the rape parts as he blocked them from his mind, but he remembers the other abuses.  Nox accidentally found a man who helped him regain control of himself when his partners would take advantage of his inability to function when pinned beneath someone.

31. Has your character ever been in love?
    No.  He doesn't let anyone in close enough to let them get to know him, or to know them.

Tell the full story.

Character Introspection

35. What is your character’s biggest goal in life?
    His biggest goal in life is to find a happy and secure place to be.  But that is something he doesn't know or understand completely.  His goal is to just survive until the next fight and get through that to survive more and so on.

36. What does your character believe is their greatest virtue?
    Temperance

37. What does your character believe is their greatest vice?
    Pride

38. What motivates your character most?
    The desire to be safe and secure is his primary motivator but he doesn't exactly understand that, he is driven to serve and take care of his 'family' and the world he lives in.

39. Is your character objective-oriented?
    Most of his life has been objective driven.  As a child it was to move up in levels as a Magnus and become Adept.  He surpassed this quickly and efficiently.  The main goal was to pass his Ad Aetatem.  Now his life is run by a series of objectives handed to him by his bosses - hunts to preform.  He does not have any personal objectives other than to stay afloat and survive life.

40. Would your character rather be a great person or a good person?
    He would rather be a good person.  He doesn't want to be noticed, he just wants to be.
