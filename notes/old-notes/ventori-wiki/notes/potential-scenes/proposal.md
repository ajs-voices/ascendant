# Honey, I'm Good

For the past few months, Dorian and I had been living together, our legal status as a couple was in full effect.  Our new abode was finished and we had everything decorated to Dorian's standards.  The venture into mutual domesticity was completed and we were happy.  Except for one thing.  Dorian was insistant upon a open relationship.  Meaning I couldn't cheat because I had permission to sleep with someone else.  No matter how many times I kept telling him I was good, he insisted upon it.  I'd given up defending the fact that I felt I could be managomous with him.  

I talked with Margo over the past few months about it.  Dorian had asked me when we started this whole thing if I'd ever consider marriage.  I told him there was no point, it was legal now.  I'm not the marrying type.  Margo thinks that could be very well be why he insists upon the open relationship.  I don't mind, really.  I know Dorian wants more than that.  

I've already told Dorian I'm not the ring kinda guy, mostly because if there were metal on my finger it could potentially melt with the fire I use regularly.  He understood.  I told him I'd suffer through a needle to give him the ring.  And for the past three months I've been sporting two new tattoos.  A ring etched in ink with Dorian's name written in Lord of the Rings Elvish, and one on my collar bone that said "Always & Forever" with a small DV hanging off the y.  Dorian had equivalents.  

But I know Dorian wants more.  So I came up with a plan.  It all hinged on tonight.  I prayed it all played out like it should but the best laid plans...

Tonight the family was getting together.  That consisted of Dorian's immediate family, mine - something I never thought I'd have, Dae'lin and Jerry, Annabel was invited but declined with 'I'm not family' and Jace and his family.  It was a house warming party - two months late, but it was Dorian's plan.

I was making steak and chicken.  Dorian had a few sides he pulled from the cafeteria cage.  Open bar or what consisted of Dorian's personal stash of things he didn't actually drink.  Dorian's alchol of choice was wine.  There was a six pack of beer in the fridge, but we had a bar neither of us used except for parties.  Who knew Dorian enjoyed throwing parties.

I had my phone playing a playlist of my choosing over the bluetooth surround sound system in our house.  It was low and background noise while I prepared the meat.  Our families started trickling in. "Honey, I'm Good!" came over the speaker system and it brought back a good memory.  I didn't mind my mind wandering to the good things, it had been doing that more and more since falling in love with Dorian.  And Jace and Margo both told me on a regular basis it was obvious I was.  I smiled at it.

The memory of dancing with Dorian for the first time to Honey I'm Good, played in my mind as I seared the first staek.  Everytime I'd asked Dorian to dance with me before that he'd shook his head.  I guess I wore him down and he let me dance around him.  He stood in place as I moved around him, against him.  I backed him against a wall and I put one hand above his head against the wall and pressed myself against him and moved against him.  I whispered the lyrics to him inches away from his lips.  Everything made me breathless and he leaned in and kissed me.  It was one of the best nights of my life.  My body reacted just as easily to the memory as it had to the real thing.

I had to push the thoughts out of my head.  I hummed along to the chorus.  But I couldn't help but move to the beat, I threw the song on repeat a few more times.  It was one of those songs that made me happy.

After an hour, everyone was here and the food was all out and everyone was eating happily - drinking their fill of the liquor.  I was sipping on a beer.  I patted the pocket of my hoodie to make sure that my precious cargo was still safely stowed.  I smiled to find the small box sitting there waiting.  

Everyone was gathered in the living space - the living room, diningroom and den all rolled into one.  My father and Dorian were chatting, about heaven knows what and the song came on again.  I grinned to myself.  I set my plate and beer down and took the small box out of my pocket and danced my way over to Dorian with my hand behind my back.

I stood behind Dorian he sighed softly as I wrapped my free arm around him and started whispering the lyrics in his ear and dancing behind him.  I felt him smile. He turned around and I dance in his arms for a moment before I spun around and opened the box and dropped to one knee as I mouthed the lyrics.

"I gotta be like oh, baby, no, baby, you got me all wrong, baby / My baby’s already got all of my love / So nah nah honey, I’m good / I could have another but I probably should not / I got somebody at home,"  He let me finish and I grinned up at him and I asked, "Dorian, marry me?"

He stood there looking at me with a stupid grin on his face and nodded.  I slipped the silver ring on his finger, it had taken me weeks to find what I thought was Dorian enough.  He pulled me to my feet and he kissed me throughly.  Then whispered, "Are you sure?"

I nodded and bit his bottom lip, his breath hitched and I whispered to him, "With all my life."  Dorian pulled me close and we kissed, Kai patted me on the back as we cherished the moment together.

By the time we decided to get back to the party everyone was happily ignoring us.  Jace piped up, "Damn! Boy you know how to propose."

I laughed and Jace hugged me.  Mia laughed, "Jace wasn't romantic."

I grinned at her, "You expect him to be romantic?"

She sighed, "Well, no, I got a ring I was happy enough about that."

Everyone congradulated us and had a good time.  There was a smile on Dorian's face the whole night.  Once we were finally alone he pulled me against him and asked with all seriousness.  "You want to do this, the whole thing?"

I nodded, "I want you to have what you want D.  If that means a big wedding at the beach, I'm okay with that.  If you want just a party celebrating what is already the truth, that's good too.  Whatever you want?"

He kissed me, "I love you."

I grinned at him, "I know.  Now take me to bed or lose me forever."

Dorian laughed at my mixed Star Wars and Top Gun references and he backed me towards our bedroom kissing and tugging at my clothes obliging my reference.  It was the second best night I'd had.
