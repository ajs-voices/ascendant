# Prologue
_September 7, 2015 9:30AM_ (needs rewrite)

I leaned forward, my elbows on my knees and my long fingers entwined together as I waited for Dr. Silverman to finish the phone call that interrupted the start of our session.  I looked around the calming office.  Everything was in its place. The glass bookshelves on the wall behind her desk carefully displayed Margo's own books she'd written.  I'd actually read them.  I didn't understand much about them, but it wasn't where I excelled anyway.  I wasn't here to learn about anyone other than my own inner workings.  

The clock chimed the bottom of the hour and Margo held up a finger indicating she'd be another minute.  I didn't mind; it gave me time to collect my thoughts - to go over things that had been happening in my life.  And since I'd gotten back to the compound I had so many things happen to me.  It had been what?  Almost three months since I was called back in to hunt a vengeful bomber.

I sat back against the blue leather couch and ran my fingers along the soft supple material along the the back until my arms were both outstretched.  Leaning my head back and scooting down until I was lounging rather than sitting I thought about all the things that had happened since then.  I'd made ammends with my father.  That I was happy about.  I now had at least one parent willing to take part in my issue laden life.  

Kai was ever so present now that I'd been living with him for the past two months.  Kai had claimed it was to help him after the stabbing, to keep him grounded.  But I was pretty sure that my father was doing it for two reasons.  One, to get to know me better, and the second, and far more important one, I cooked for him.  Breakfast in the morning and dinner at night were both waiting for him at decent times.  I think he liked that more than he liked me.  He needed to find himself a wife.  I laughed to myself and caught movement in front of me as Margo sat down in the chair opposite me.

I raised my head and smiled.  Margo returned the smile and asked, "What's so funny?"

I sat up and rearranged myself so I didn't look quite so bored.  I'd found out a long time ago if I sat instead of lounged or laid like in the movies I could spill the beans about what was on my mind much easier.  "I was just thinking about all the things that had happened since I came back.  I thought to myself, my dad needs to find a wife."

The color in Margo's cheeks flared slightly.  I wondered if she knew it had happened.  Shortly after my father had met Margo for the first time I found them biding each other good-bye with a sweet kiss outside her office shortly before my meeting.  I hadn't told either of them I knew.  But her fleeting emotions were gone as she asked me, "Why is that funny?"

"That fact isn't the funny part.  I was internalizing the reasons I think my father likes having me around.  I feed him.  That's a wife's job, it's why I thought he needed a wife."

Her mouth formed a perfect little O and I grinned, "I don't think you and my father are quite at that stage if you think that's what I was implying."

Her face turned scarlet as she stared at me with a dumb-founded look.  I smiled and leaned back against the couch, "I've know pretty much since you two started dating."

"Nox.  You never said anything."

I laughed, "It makes this moment all the better."  

Margo shook he head and sighed, "Since we are on the topic, how does your father's new relationship make you feel?"

I smiled, "I'm okay with it.  It's not like I knew him with my mother or any other woman.  If he's happy, and I think he is, all the better for me."

Margo nodded and jotted some notes on her tablet.  "So your acting out has nothing to do with the change in parental dynamics?"

I sat forward again and sighed, "What am I 5?  I live with my father because he asked me to move in while D and I wait on our new pad to be finished.  I rarely stay the night and when I do I hardly sleep, but that has nothing to do with who my father is sleeping with.  It has no bearing on my acting out as you put it."

"So why all the new faces in your life?"

I knew she'd ask eventually.  I already knew why, it was a piss on you moment that got carried away.  I smiled at her, "You won't tell my father?"

She sighed, "Nox we have confidences you know this.  I do not share with your father your sessions, unless you ask me to consult with those necessary."

I grinned, "Just making sure.  They are nothing more than a game.  I've never really kissed any of them in front of him, it just looks that way.  And when I don't come home at night, I'm at Dorian's.  I spend most nights at Dorian's for that matter."

"Your father says you come home most nights, and are there when he gets up.  How are you managing that to spend the night with Dorian every night?"

"Logistics are easy.  My father is a heavy sleeper, a fact I knew the first night when I broke a vase coming in and it shattered all over the floor.  He barely even noticed the vase was gone much less commented on the noise.  I come home.  I'm awake until he goes to bed anyway, so I wait until he's asleep and go to Dorian's.  I'm up at 4am anyway, so I've done my workout, had a shower and cooking breakfast for D and my father in the morning by the time Kai is out of bed."

"Dorian is okay with you coming in at all hours of the night?"

I laughed, "Dorian waits up for me. He's a night owl anyway and I usually have time to grade a few lessons before Dorian is ready to go to sleep."

"Quite the domestic arrangement you have going on.  Not something I'd have expected of you.  But why the games then?"  She asked.  

Margo always asked the questions even though I was pretty sure she knew the answer already.  "My father forced Dorian and I into an arrangement.  I'm making him think I don't want it.  But I'm more than fine with the arrangement.  I sleep better with Dorian.  I feel better because of actual sleep."

"You are aware that both Dorian and your father have expressed concerns with your antics?"  She leaned a little forward.  She wanted that answer to be honest and truthful and I wasn't sure what to say.

"I didn't know Dorian had an issue with it."  I frowned, it was the truth.  I thought Dorian understood what I was doing. We'd discussed it in length.  "I thought he understood."  It seemed D and I would need to speak again about this.

Margo intertupted my thoughts, "Let me rephrase that.  Dorian has expressed an concern about your tendancies for multiple partners.  While Kai has expressed concerns about your current 'game'".  Margo made those lovely air quotes around the word game and I had to grin.  "I thought they were one and the same issue."

I shook my head.  "No.  I am to the best of my ability remaining managomous with Dorian.  We've discussed this.  We've had talks about what I'm doing to my father and why I felt it necessary."

Margo interrupted, "Why do you feel it's necessary?"  She hated to interrupt me but she must think this was important to do so.

So I answered, "Because I don't like being told what to do.  I can't rebel against anything in the contract.  I can rebel against the arrangement.  He told me we could be just friends, Dorian and I.  I am just playing the card right now.  I have no intentions of being unfaithful.  I know it's hard to beleive.  But I don't see my life getting any better without Dorian in it.  He's everything I need, and more importantly he's everything I want.  And that is good enough for me.  I can't say that we'll always be this blissfully happy, or that it'll last till death do us part, but right now in this moment, it's right."

Margo nodded, "Dorian isn't so sure you are happy or that you will be happy.  Why do you think that is?"

I hung my head to hide the frown that showed and the slight heat that rose in the back of my neck.  I knew why Dorian was having issues, I sighed, "I've turned down marriage two or three separate times."

When I looked up at Margo I expected to see something other than the dead pan look I was receiving.  "Why did you turn him down, if you need him as you said?"

I took a swallow of the water from the bottle I'd brought with me.  I didn't want to answer.  But this was about honesty and so I said it anyway, "It's just another peice of paper that says we are together.  We have that already."

Margo smiled, "Maybe it's not the paper he wants.  Maybe he wants something more than that.  Like to tell the world that you are his, and he is yours?  Maybe he wants to have a big fancy wedding and a huge party?  Don't you think you should think about **why** Dorian might actually be asking you?  I understand that Dorian and you are together legally and binding, and that your relationship is strong right now.  Maybe Dorian needs that ring for you to prove to him you want this exactly as it is."

I leaned back in the couch and ran my fingers through my hair.  I put my head on the back and stared up at the ceiling.  I never noticed the waterstain above me.  I wondered how long it had been there.  I sat up and rearranged myself, my elbows on my knees and my fingers interlaced together and I took a deep breath.   I looked at Margo and watched the shifting of her eyes from me to her notes before I spoke.  "So I'm not thinking it through in the right way and hurting Dorian in the process is what you are saying?  Dorian doesn't care about the paper."  I smiled at the thought I'd just had, "He wants the show.  The perfect wedding, the perfect reception.  For the prefect arrangement, because how else is a man like him supposed to be."

I sighed.  "I don't think he'll ask again."

Margo gave me that knowing little smile she did when she had something highly enlightening to say, "So ask him."

The answer was so very simple yet it was the hardest solution to the problem.  Asking Dorian meant making it perfect.  And there were things to buy and do and things to plan.  But she was right, it was why Dorian was doubting me.  I was giving him every reason to and he thought I was pushing him away.  So not what I wanted to do.

I smiled at Margo as she looked at her watch, "This wasn't what I had intended to talk about.  But our time is nearly up.  One quick question to wrap things up, Nox."  I nodded my acceptance of the question, "How are things going with Drake and your teaching?"

I laughed, "That's two questions in one."  Margo gave me a guilty look.  "Things with Drake are good.  He's doing better now that he's staying with us.  His control isn't great but he's not scaring anyone or starting random fires anymore.  He still sparks, but for all I know that's common for dragons.  He likes Dorian's place better.  I can't say as I blame him though, Kai's is kinda boring."

I smiled, "Teaching I like.  Though I get the same looks and stares as I did when I want to the academy.  Apparently this generation is very well aware of who I am.  But it's nothing I'm not used to.  The kids are all good and they listen and are learning."

Margo nodded, "So those two things aren't causing any stress on your life?"

I shook my head, "No.  Should they?"

Margin smiled, "Being a new father to a three year old and teaching at the same time is rough on a good day.  Drake is similar to you I expect some emotional lash back.  And the kids well again emotional lash back."

I shook my head.  "Nothing I can't handle.  And nothing I'm worried about right now.  I mean it when I say, sleeping in Dorian's bed has made a huge difference on my outlook of life and my well being.  Why would I ever want to leave it?"

Margo nodded, "You are a lucky man for having found him if he is the god-send you claim him to be."

"I don't know about god-send, but I'm glad to have seen him in a different light."  I stood up. I knew my time was up.  

Margo nodded.  "I will see you again next week, Nox.  Take care and think on what I said about Dorian."

I smiled and waved as I walked out the door.  I didn't have to think on it, I already knew what I was going to do.

Margo maintained an office in the Infirmary, which was technically open to the public as a medical facility.  It wasn't really used but some people preferred the doctors here than elsewhere so even humans came up into this level of the compound.  I always saw people I didn't know wandering the halls.  Not that I could know every single person, but I knew the regulars, human or not, on Mondays.

I rounded a corner with my head completely on my ideas for my current situation.  I didn't notice as I ran into someone slightly shorter but far stockier than I was.  I glanced down and my body froze as I stared into the dirty green eyes of the man who had abused me as a child.  Garrett stared up at me with anger in his eyes.  He looked like he was going to yell at me, but he quickly warped into the calm and pleasant person I remembered first meeting.  "How nice to bump into you again, Nox." His voice grated on my ears.  I knew it was a trick my mind played on me as my fears started to overwhelm me.

Sweat formed on my brow and I could feel a bead slowly working its way down the side of my face.  My voice was distant as I spoke, "Ma..."  I stopped myself from finishing the title of my youth, "Garrett."  It sounded so foreign, the words incomplete.  I didn't even sound like myself.

I was lost in my nightmares as Garret looked me over like a long lost friend.  His eyes met mine an he seemed warm and caring - like it had been of old, but I knew it was all lies.  He spoke as if nothing had ever happened, "As I understand it, you've acheived much since our time together.  And since we even last spoke."  He beamed with pride at my acomplishments.  His pride made my stomach lurched. My body physically recoiled from mere thought Garrett had anything at all to do with any of it.  

He watched me like a hawk; his dusty gaze sweeping over me like I was still a child.  He smiled at me.  Then he pointed to the other side of the hall, that was miracuolsly empty for this time of the day.  I moved automatically.  

I would beat myself up over this later, but seeing my nightmares made flesh threw my entire existance into a spiral.  I never took my eyes off of the man who was once my mentor but I moved where he indicated. I could feel the fear inside bubbling with tenacity.  I could see the retribution he'd take out on me. I was living my own nightmares without ever closing my eyes.  

Garrett gave me a reassurimg smile as he spun his finger in a cirle.  I shook my head and watched as my defiance rolled across him.  Garret formed the tentacle of my nightmares.  I closed my eyes.  I didn't want to watch the patterns change like I had so many times in my dreams.  My body was tense as I waited for the strike. I was surprised I was not quaking in fear.  I couldn't move. I couldn't think.  I waited for the blow I knew would land.  

Seconds past, a minute.  I opened my eyes and there was no one before me.  Had I dreamt it all?  I leaned against the wall and slid to the floor.  In my head I could hear Garrett laughing at me - that evil laughter all villians on cartoons laugh.  I wrapped my arms around my legs and pulled them close to my chest and I tried not to let my fears take over.
