# Attack

Kai's world began to spin, it was one thing to be injured, but Nicholas was not venatori. He was nothing but a magnus, tied to the compound to do what ever magical feats were required of him.  His talents were not in fighting or knowledge.  His status as a Magnus was the brightest point on Nicholas' tarnished star.  But to Kai he was his son no matter his flaws.  Blood was blood, no matter what.

Kai returned to the Vegas with sadness written all over his face, "My son has been hurt, I have to go."

Emilio jumped up, "What happened?"  He was a true friend, ready to fight anything that needed fighting for Kai.  But right now he knew little more than what he'd already said.  

"I don't know.  I will call you when I know more."  Kai walked around the table and gave Dolores a hug and a kiss on the check, "Dinner was excellent, thank you for letting me stay."

The woman gave him a bright smile, "Anytime Kai, and next time bring the family."

Kai only grinned.  It was unlikely any of his family would ever join the Vegas in dinner parties.  Once they were away from his tutelage, they tended to flee his vicinity.  It was their freedom they wanted from him.  But they were the people they were today because he was hard on them.  He loved them with his life, and he would do anything for them.  Anything.  There will still parts of recent and not so recent history he wasn't proud of, but everything was done for a reason.  And he only wished he could make up for some of it.  Sadly sins of the past can't be fixed quite so easily.

Emilio walked Kai to the door and gave him a pat on the back, "Let me know if you need anything."

Kai nodded as he walked out the door and headed for the infirmary.  He was surprised tos ee the fire squad leaving.  Nicholas has not ever been a fire starter his skills lie in the opposite - water and air.  But it was one of them who stopped him.  "Mr. Viddens.  Do you know anyone that would want to harm your son?"

Kai shook his head, "Zealots, in the compound unlikely, targeting my son who is harmless fly.  No I don't see anyone seeing to gain tactics with Nicholas.  What happened?"

The man frowned, "As best we can suspect it was an elemental bomb.  Your son opened it.  We have a forensic team on it, but we don't have anyone good enough with pattern reconstruction in the compound, they are all out in the field."

Kai nodded, "How is my son?"

The man shook his head, "He was alive last I saw him.  Burns covering 30% of his body, the worst was inhalation.  He's in surgury, the best he can get.  I have to go.  Best of luck!"

Kai paced in the hallway for what felt like hours, no one came.  It was annoying, and then Nicholas' mother showed up in a panic.  She fell into a chair in a mass of tears.  "My boy, don't tell me he's dead."

Kai shook his head, "He's in surgury Gloria."  She always was a nut job.  It was amazing that he ever saw anything in the woman.  He wished she'd been some random woman that he'd taken up with for the sake of breeding but she was not, that was long well and done with by the time he'd met her.  What he saw he didn't know.  

She cried and Kai couldn't take it anymore, "I'm going to go see if I can help find out what happened."  He said to no one in particular but he had to get away from her.

Kai followed the rumors, his son had been found in his room, so that was where Kai went.  The first floor of the adult residences.  The boy's room was rather plain even for a first year, and he wasn't a first year.  Kai wondered what the boy was up to.  He prayed he wasn't living with some unknown man.  But knowing Nicholas he probably was, the boy flitted from lover to lover like he was a butterfly looking for the best flower.

The remains of the table were scattered everywhere.  Peices of it looked as if they were missing and Kai wondered if part of that was what caused his son's injuries.  He could make out the smell of nothing explosive, magical talent was definitely the cause of the whole thing.  He saw fire and earth, but that was all, but the man had said elemental.  He looked at a few remaining people.  "Are all elements present?"

The woman looking through a special lens nodded, "Yes sir.  This was no ordinary bomb, from what I can tell.  There are reminants of fire with water and air and earth strung together so tight I can barely tell where one ends and the other meets.  It's a wonder your son survived at all."  She put the lens down and walked over to the chared stain on the carpet in the center of the blast from what Kai could tell.

"He sat down, he opened what we can only assume was a box.  We've seen scraps of charred cardboards lying around that belong to nothing in the room.  The bomb exploded."  The woman drew with a fine line of fire in the air the directions in which she thought the force played out, "There was very little concussive force towards the bottom, but the table was inferior and shattered.  Your son flew backwards toppling the chair.  If the alarms had not been set he would have died, elemental burns are hard to douse.  I think he was trying when they burst in."

"We've had similar bombs in packages over the past week.  One just randomly exploded in the mail room.  It took other things with them, we don't know what the original was addressed to.  No one can see everything, these bombs are well made, sir."

Kai nodded.  

A man called out to the woman and she stepped away from Kai and the charered spot.  She waggled a finger at him, "You might want to see this."

A typed note which was fairly charred was being held between two a pair of gloved fingers.  Kai could make out only a few words through the chair, "Your family."  Kai swallowed, could this be about his family or was this just some note from Nicholas' table.  There really was only one way to tell, and that was ask Nicholas what was going on. And he would only get that chance if his son made it through surgury okay.
