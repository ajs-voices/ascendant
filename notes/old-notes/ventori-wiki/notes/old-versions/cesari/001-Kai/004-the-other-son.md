# The Other Son

Kai went to see Dae'lin and Gary.  They were in Dae'lin's office discussing the same thing he wanted to.  The small women was nodding in agreement about something as Kai walked in, both heads turned and they stopped talking when they saw him.  He wasn't going to like what they were talking about he was sure of that.  "Talking about me."  He winked at her, "You little vixen."  Dae'lin blushed furiously as he saw the anger rise in her.  She was so easy to fluster.

Gary laughed as he walked out, "You make her splutter like that too often you might find your seat is a bit hotter than you like."

Kai shook his head, "I'd like to see her try."  Kai gave Dae'lin a smile that said I dare you.

"We were discussing your son's case, not you exactly."  She claimed as she sat down in her chair.  

Kai nodded, "And I won't like it?"

Dae'lin frowned, "You have Emilio's gift now?  Or did you see something?"

Kai laughed, "You clamped your mouths shut the moment you saw me.  So you were either talking about me, or about something I won't like.  Since it's not the first, it has to be the latter."

Dae'lin sighed, "Yes.  You won't like it."  She sat and fumbled with a peice of paper.  "I've called in the best expert I can think of on close knit patterns."

Kai nodded, "Okay, that's not a cause for concern, I'm glad of that."

Dae'lin nodded, "You say that now."  She looked down and pushed a small file folder his direction.  "Nox Durante, MNC5, the only person I know who uses patterns like this."

Kai frowned.  "You are bringing him back?  Dae'lin leave him where he is.  Emilio and I can handle this."  When the world collapses around you, it does so in so many different directions.  Not only would Kai have to fight whatever sick bastard had hurt his son, but deal with sins of his past, despite the fact that he didn't know he was even making them at the time.  

Dae'lin shook her head, "No Kai you are too close to this.  Gary and I agree we need Nox.  Mark is the only Cesari in the compound and you know he'll create whatever we need, but the patterns he uses are not violent.  He's a passivist, he won't know."

"I will reiterate again.  Emilio and I can handle this, Dae'lin.  The boy is just going to get in the way, cause trouble and..."

Dae'lin sighed, "And what Kai?  Remind you what he is to you?  It's too late Kai, he's coming.  I already called him, and he's on his way."

Kai stood up, he looked at Dae'lin and he wanted to scream at her to pull that little whelp of a girl off her high horse.  He'd go to her father.  Matias would see reason.  He was sure of that.  Nox Durante, his half human son, a reminder of mistakes made in his youth, a reminder of things Kai would rather not remember from his own childhood staring him in the face.  Kai was glad Mark had shipped him off without warning, shipped him off before he tarnished the good Viddens name now that he was certified as his son.  The boy was trouble, this was not going to end well.
