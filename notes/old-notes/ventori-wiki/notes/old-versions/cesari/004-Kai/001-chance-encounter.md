# Chance Encounters

Kai hadn't expected to run into the boy so soon.  He had been going to see Dae'lin about getting a little help on the hunt he and Emilio had been on before all this went down.  He hadn't expected to roll through the boy, up ended by his abrupt appearance.  And he surely hadn't expected Nox to back talk him, much less use his gift on him.  The control he weilded was still something that Kai was not used to.  

Most Magnus thought long and hard before using the patterns, himself included, but for the boy it was second nature.  He flung patterns around like nothing.  He was human.  Dorian had told him the day before he'd met his son for the first time that he used his gift as compensation for his lack of speed and strength to keep up.  He had honed his gift into a weapon.   Despite his resignations, maybe it was good Dae'lin called him in.  Kai didn't have to like it, but he would see where it went now that he was reminded of the boy's talents.

Kai rubbed the places where the invisible bonds had held him to the wall.  He shivered at the thought.  Never before had the gift been used like a weapon.  It was a tool to be used, but never so easily.  With the potential of a bomber using the elements to kill his family, it made the whole thing seem even worse.  Could his son be the culprit?  Revenge upon his family?  Was he so loathed that the boy would try to kill his own brother?

Doubt crept in. If he doubted his own flesh and blood, who else could it possibly be.  Kai wasn't the most popular kid in school, and he wasn't the most popular now that he'd grown up.  One of the best, yes, but liked - hardly.

Kai shook off the doubt like he did everything else.  He pushed aside his son's fluency with the patterns and he headed towards Dae'lin's office.  Dae'lin was pacing in her office clearly she'd been flustered for whatever reason.  

Kai knocked on the door and she turned with a flat stare and then continued her pacing.  "I don't have time for this Kai."

Kai sat down, "I'm not here to discuss my son."

She stopped her pacing and looked at him with a level look.  "You aren't?  Then why are you here?"  She sat down in her chair across the desk from him.  Her professionalism back to where it was usually.

"I need someone to, or a few someones to pick up the hunt for our vamp.  They just need to find him again.  I'll do the deed.  I just think my time is better spent here trying to figure it out."  Kai watched Dae'lin as he spoke.  The brunette's eyes followed his every word, her fingers twitched in her hair as she listened.  She was a sweet girl, and the pedegree was right.  If they were to get another Cesari by blood she was the Venatori's best bet, she and Nox.  It was hard to beleive that the Magnus would put that boys weakness into the line just for Cesari, but it was what it was.

Dae'lin brought Kai out of his thoughts, "I think I can manage to find someone to do some tracking for you.  I do imagine you want the kill, and I wouldn't send anyone less seasoned after Bernstein.  It will be pure recon."

Kai nodded, "Thank you.  I did run into my son."

Dae'lin frowned and her face heated up again, Kai wondered what the boy had said to her to make her flush so throughly.  "He threw me up against a wall with his ability.  I'm not sure how I like his attitude."

Dae'lins frown deepened, "Was it unprovoked?"

It was Kai's turn to frown, "No.  He was recipocating.  I'm not exactly sure why I did what I did.  He's just so...."

"Like you?"  Dae'lin added as Kai was floundering for words.  "He's like you.  Stubborn, dry humor, highly flirtaeous, a pain in my ass, I can keep going if you'd like?"

Kai shook his head. "No that's alright.  I don't need additional reasons..."  He wasn't exactly sure what he meant to say and he let Dae'lin add to it whatever she thought he was going to say.  Nox Durante was just a constant reminder of everything Kai had ever failed at in life. "I have work to do.  Thank you."

Kai got up and left Dae'lin's office with that lie.  He didn't have the foggiest idea of what to do for this case.  He headed to the Infirmary to check on Nicholas' progress.  Maybe he'd luck out there.
