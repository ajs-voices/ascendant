# Procreation

Nox walked into compound with Stella still on his mind.  He hadn't even noticed the elevator. Not too much anyway.  But he was brought out of his relatively good mood the moment he stepped off the elevator.  Dae'lin grabbed him by the arm and started dragging him down the hall towards the testing facilities.  "Where the hell have you been?" 

Dae'lin spewed out more information than Nox could comprehend in the few moemnts it took for her to speak the words.  All the while fire patterns rose from her and he could feel the edge of heat just about ready to combust.  

They finally made it to their destination and Dae'lin let go of the grip on his arm. The fire in her eyes was almost as hot as the temperature of the room. He could see the patterns shifting around Dae'lin as her temper got the better of her.  Of all the training he had received from her, she still had to learn to control her anger, Nox grinned as the fury level rose.  Nox calmly shifted a water pattern above her heads and let the water rain down on top of them both.  

Dae'lin sputtered and walked out of the room slamming the door behind her.  A few moments later Dorian walked in chuckling to himself.  "We've a package for you to look at.  It was deleivered to your father."

Nox turned to look at the table with the brown box sitting neatly on top of it.  Dae'lin  came back in dripping wet still but with a few paper towels and closed the door. Nox noticed how the blue blouse she'd worn now clung to her shapely body.  She caught him looking at her and blushed and punched him in the arm.  "That was uncalled for!"

Nox laughed.  Dae'lin sat down in one of the chairs in the room and Nox sat down in front of the box.  His pants soaked through in seconds but it had been well worth the momentary discomfort.  "What was?  The soaking, or the leering?"

Dae'lin's blush deepened and she wadded up a piece of paper and threw it at him.  Nox grinned at her.  She met his eyes, "Either.  You weren't in your room.  And the shit, that he is, said you were out reading files.  Why is he covering for you?"  She nodded towards Dorian who was standing near the mirror on the other wall.  Nox stared at the mirror and had a distinct feeling he was being watched.  It was the room, he hated this room, but he turned his attention back to Dae'lin.

Nox grinned, "Because he understands what all this is going to do to me but despite your worry he knew what I needed so I could focus again."

Dae'lin shook her head the anger and disappointment full in her voice, "You needed to get laid, by a girl you just met?  That was necessary."

Nox rolled his eyes, "Jason tell you that?"

Dae'lin frowned, "He told me about the little strumpet you met on the plane.  Said you had a date with her, I put two and two together."

Nox stood up with a frown.  "There was no laying involved in the least, and no sex either if that's what you want to imply.  We had dinner, talked and I kissed her goodnight.  Happy.  Not that it is any of your business."

Dae'lin's voice rose, "It IS my business, you damn well know it is.  Not only are you on a job, you are in the middle of contract negotiations. You know the rules."

Nox glanced at Dorian who was tring his best not to squirm as he and Dae'lin were about to have this fight in front of him. But he remained quiet and Nox sighed, "I have neither agreed to nor declined the invitation to sleep with you Dae'lin.  You want what you want, I have work to do and a bomber to find."

Nox opened the door only to find the patterns shifting, blocking it from opening.  He turned to Dae'lin who stood inches from him.  She stared up at him with fury in her eyes.  "You want to keep living the life you do, you know what my father wants."

Nox laughed, "You seem overly eager to have it yourself."

Dae'lin's presence shrank in admission of her desires.  "You provide the best genetics for any offspring Nox.  I do not want marriage and family and to settle down with you.   I do not want my mother's life.  I want this one.  One day to be head of the Venatori Magnus.  I want this, but progeny don't make themselves.  They are knocking heads together.  Too many have forgotten their duty.  As leader I must set an example.  Please Nox.  Do this so we can live our lives like we both want to."

Nox leaned against the door to put distance between him and Dae'lin.  "Who says I don't want any of that?"  

Dae'lin laughed, "Right, that coming from the guy who sleeps with every human girl or guy who'd have him.  And the tales of the exploits you and Jason have had, make any sane person want to run and hide in embarrassment."

Nox laughed, "My exploits?  How politically correct can you get.  And what if all that's a cover for the one thing I want?  The one thing I can't have here?"

Dae'lin frowned, "Do this and you can have that now. Jason and Mia have their arrangements made and he's growing up more and more as she gets farther along.  He will be a good father.  Mia understands his situation.  You can find someone too.  Even Dorian is looking and we all know how difficult that is for him."

Nox shook his head, "I have work to do.  So if you are done..."  Dae'lin stomped out of the room like she was having temper tantrum.  Nox sat down in the chair, Dae'lin gone he could focus on work again. "Sorry about that."

Dorian only nodded but Nox could see the sympathy in his eyes.  He didn't exactly look happy to be included as an arguement in their arguement.  But that was much the way of the life among the Venatori - everyone knew everyone, and everyone knew everything about everyone else.

Nox sighed as he looked at the packaged.  "Back to work.  So Kai got this?  Looks legit.  Right?"

Dorian nodded and pulled a chair to the side of the table so that he could see the box better. "Yeah.  The stamp is the same shade as past packages, everything looks to be in order.  Your father said he found it on his kitchen counter."

"So he doesn't know who delievered it or where it actually came from.  At least he didn't open it."

Dorian nodded, "Your father is a smart man.  He wouldn't step in the viper pit if he knew where it was."

Nox grinned.  "The vipers would probably just run away anyway."

Dorian chuckled, then prompted, "What do you see?"

"All kinds of weird shit.  The patterns shouldn't eminate from a box like this.  Bomb or no bomb.  It's like water, it's moving.  Stable patterns don't move.  Unless it's meant to, this isn't meant to.  It's almost like the person can't see the pattern.  The structure is missing, but the peices are all here.  Kinda like geletain without a mold.  What do you see, oh master of patterns?"

Dorian shook his head.  "I'm not a master of patterns.  I can each each element.  I see complexities I've never seen.  I don't see the movment you suggest though."

"Look a little harder and you'll see it.  Think like a magnifying glass in your head.  Zoom in to see greater detail."

Nox could see Dorian looking at him with his head cocked before he turned his attention to the box.  Nox watched Dorian as he studied the box.  They sat in silence for several moments before Dorian spoke, "Holy. Mother...."

Nox grinned, "See told ya."  Nox started to create a bubble of solid air around the box, "Any idea how big the blast was from the explosion before?"

Dorian nodded and handed Nox a peice of paper, "I figured you'd ask."

Nox smiled and rifled through the prior findings.  "Thanks.  You probably could spout the answer off to me without me searching."

"It left a scorch mark of about 6 meters.  Items in the room that looked to have been previously close were flung across the room.  The concussive force was greated than the blast raidus."

Nox smiled, "See, wasn't that simpler."  Nox adjusted the thickness and the tightness of the pattern.  "Do we know what kinds of shrapnel there was."

Dorian shook his head, "All earth particles."

Nox grimaced, "Ouch.  So there is nothing left of the bomb itself."

Dorian shook his head, "Not really.  Just old patterns floating around."

Nox sighed, "Alright.  This should keep us safe.  You want to be here while I poke at a bomb?"  He really didn't want to hurt Dorian.  Dorian only smiled at him with an eager look.  "Suit yourself."
