# Fire and Things

Kai always brought Nox's mood down.  Now all he wanted to do was break things.  The words he spoke to his father left a bad taste in his mouth, the threats that came out, while completely true were not something Nox was likely to do.  He was not going to kill his father because he hated him own son.  If it were self defense he'd be in the right, but Kai was never that stupid.  

Kai was a good man, or so everyone always told Nox.  'Oh you're Kai's boy, the half human one, he's a good man.  Best Venatori hunter we've had in centuries.'  Never mind that Nox was Cesari, always half human - always when associated with Kai Videns.  The disgraceful Dimiaeter.  Nox rolled his eyes.  The man hated him for no other reason.

Even Dorian had not included him in the Videns family.  Not that Nox wanted to be included with his father or his half siblings.  He was not Videns nor was he really Durante.  His mother was no better than his father.  She had nearly spat at him when he returned to Colorado.  She despised his very nature.  Her child was a monster.  Nox at least understood that with her background, but he was her son.

Nox's phone rang pulling him from the damning thoughts, he picked up his cell phone and saw it was from the Hotel Pennsylvania.  He smiled, Stella was calling him.  He took a deep breath and answered it, "Hey Stella."

Stella's chipper voice swam over the line, it was almost music to Nox's ears, "Hi.  You figure out your plans yet?"

Nox grinned, "Not exactly, but I can make time.  Bout two hours from now sound good to you?"

Nox heard the smile in Stella's voice, "Sure.  That's fine.  I'll see you then."  She hung up the line and Nox was left wanting again.  She had to know what that did to him to keep doing it so easily.

Stella's interruption had taken some of the edge off, but the moment he hung up the phone he could feel the hatred boiling inside again.  Nox grabbed his laptop and headed out the door.  

Nox found himself in an empty training room.  It was meant for fire starters, nearly everything in the room was fire resistant or easily replaced.  The sprinkler system and alarm set up was different in this room.  It was perfect to let off a little steam, almost literally for Nox.  He set up his laptop and started a search on reports that contained both the Videns and Vega family names. There had to be some connection. 

The little wheel started spinning and Nox left the laptop against the wall to chime at him when it finished.

Nox set to throwing fireballs at the far wall.  The pattern was simple.  The fire formed effortlessly in his hands.  It was his first element, his most powerful one, and the one he tended to use most.  Nox remembered being in a similar room when he was younger learning to control the fire that came when he was frightened or angry.  It had even happened when he was sad once.  But that was more accident than loss of control.  

Nox remembered pretending he was a dragon, he only vaguely understood from his Venatori school before that dragons were real.  Now, he had a burn scar running his left leg as proof of that fact.  But the fact that dragons in human form could still breathe fire was not something Nox was ever likely to forget because of that scar.  It had left him out of commission for far too long.

Fireball after fireball, Nox pushed his mood into each one.  He let it burn away the hatred his father had left like an oil slick on his mood.  His laptop chimed its completion but Nox continued to throw fireballs at the wall, one, two, three at a time, as many as he could possibly to try to fend off the anger that boiled inside him.  His temper was something that he'd gotten from his father, he hadn't know it until more recently but he saw it now very easily.

The door to the training room opened and Nox knew who it was before he shut the door.  The comforting smell of vanilla and cinnamon, the smells of home and safety reached his nose long before Dorian said anything.  Nox smiled at the memory of him earlier that day.  The way the patterns shifted around him, the smile he offered when he was coming down from the fear.  This was a man who had comforted him when he was younger, who'd guided him.  And Nox had never realized the man was just that a man, someone who didn't hate him.  It made things a little better.

Nox could feel eyes on the back of his neck.  But he continued to throw fireballs at the far wall lost in his own thoughts.  Dorian broke the silence with softly spoken words, "I am still amazed at the power you possess, and how easily you do this."

Nox turned around as a fireball was forming in his hand, Nox grinned at Dorian, "It's what I do."  Nox threw a few more fireballs as Dorian watched him.  The silence was deafening, "You didn't come here to watch me vent.  What's up?"

From the corner of his eye, Nox could see Dorian leaning against the wall by the laptop, "I came here for several reasons.  The first was to apologize for Kai's behavior.  I saw what happened, there is no excuse for his actions."

Nox smiled, "There is nothing for you to apologize for that.  He is his own man."  Nox grinned playfully as he turned to look at Dorian with two balls of fire dancing, one in each hand, "Unless of course you sent him after me."

Dorian chuckled, "No, I did not send him after you.  But he won't apologize, and eveyone else will excuse his behavior.  You don't deserve that, least of all from your father."

Nox turned around and threw the fireballs, criss crossing one another as they flew towards the wall. "The other reasons?"

Dorian laughed, "Always to the point.  The second reason, I'd rather keep to myself."  

Nox chuckled to himself, "Have it your way.  Is there a third?"

Dorian smiled, "I heard from a little bird, that you had a date tonight.  That's the third reason I'm here.  You are going aren't you?"

Nox looked at Dorian with confusion, Dorian smirked, "You do recall that I knew your every move as a child.  And I knew before I heard the truth of things from your teachers what you had and had not done.  You are predictable.  You came here because you were boiling over with anger.  You came to throw fireballs at the world, burning away the anger, so you could think.  It's why the laptop is sitting here.  You intend to work tonight, not go see this girl."

Nox turned and started another fireball, "Well Dorian, you are getting rusty.  I intend to go.  But I had to blow off some steam.  Kai always infuriates me."

"I know."

Nox let the fireball wither on his hand as he turned around.  He looked at Dorian leaning against the wall smiling at him. Dorian looked like he always had remembered, the soft eyes, the thoughtful and caring look, Nox closed his eyes, Dorian's voice caressed places it shouldn't, "Go see this girl.  Forget the world for an hour or two.  If Dae'lin asks I'll cover for you, tell her you are following up on a lead I gave you at a coffee shop to be alone and away from all this."  Nox opened his eyes to see Dorian waving his hands around indicating the whole place.  "Enjoy yourself before the work really sets in."

Two hours had flown by, Nox hadn't really noticed it.  The time on his watch told him he would barely have time to grab a quick shower.  Too many thoughts rolled through his head, maybe a calm dinner with a girl and her child would be relaxing enough.  Nox doubted that but it was worth a shot. "I'm going."  He told Dorian with a grin as he picked up his laptop and held the door for Dorian's exit.
