# Bigger Distractions

The walk to the hotel was not quite as head clearing as he'd thought it would be.  Nox had dropped off his things in his room and grabbed a quick shower.  He threw on a better pair of black jeans and his green "Ask me about my T-Rex" t-shirt over a white undershirt.  It would be fun for Aidan, hopefully.  Stella awaited and he didn't want to keep her waiting too long.  Fashionably late was so passe.

Nox walked into the hotel entrance, it reminded him of the compound in the fancy way it was all laid out so pretty and elegant.  He went to the front desk and the brunette woman there smiled at him, her teeth too white against the bright red lipstick she wore, "Can I help you?"

Nox grinned, "I'm here to see Stella..."  He hadn't asked her last name.

Nox caught the woman's name from her name plate, Elaine, her smile widened as she spoke, "Ms. Row said you would be stopping by and to send you up.  Her room is 405.  If you use that elevator group over there, " she pointed to the correct set, "you'll be there in no time.  You are Nox correct?"  Nox turned back to see what the woman wanted.  She was holding out a bottle of wine, "Take this up.  It's on the house."

"Really?"  Nox asked, "Why?"

She smiled, "Well I was told to say that.  A friend of your's called, insisted if you show up we send it up with you."

Nox laughed, "Thanks for telling me the truth.  Tell him when he calls back I got the hint."  Dorian was making sure he had a good time.

Nox was glad the elevator here wasn't plate glass, he could handle that far more not seeing he was actually going up higher and higher.   It was a short distance to her room from the elevator, that was both good and bad, high traffic sucked.

Nox knocked on the door, he heard Stella exclaim, "Shit!" from the other side of the door.  Stella opened up the door with a plush white towel wrapped around her red locks and a towel around her upper body.  Nox smiled and tried very hard not to look anywhere other than her eyes.  She laughed, "So very sweet.  Come in.  Let me finish getting dressed."

Nox came in and shut the door with a grin, "You didn't have to shower for me."

Stella laughed, "If I told you it wasn't because you were coming over I'd be lying, but I showered hours ago and Aidan kept me from finishing up."  Nox walked into the large room, a playpen sat in the middle of the floor with the little one fast asleep.  

Nox moved back towards the bathroom, and leaned against the bathroom wall so he didn't have to shout, "He's sleeping now."

Stella poked her head out, the towel slipping off her head to reveal her disheveled head of red hair, "Finally!  He's been a royal terror since we left you and Jason."

Nox laughed, "Ain't we all been."

"Bad day?"  Stella inquired as he heard the water turn on.

"It's about par for normal here.  Needless to say meeting you and Aidan was the highlight of my day.  But I don't want to talk about my day.  How is New York treating you so far?"

Stella came out of the bathroom with a green shirt that hung off her shoulder, a black bra strap stark against her pale skin, her hair was neatly brushed but it was still damp.  Nox grinned at her as she looked up at him.  "The hotel is great.  Met a cute guy who brings me wine."

Nox held up the wine bottle, "And if I said I was that thoughtful I'd be a liar."  He grinned.  "A friend who is covering for me sent this up, he apparently wants us to have a good time."

Stella laughed and took the wine bottle from him, "He sounds very romantic.  Unlike another someone I can mention."

Nox laughed, "Well at least that someone has cute going for him."

Nox could see the heat rise in Stella's neck, "You noticed that huh?"

Nox grinned and handed Stella two plastic cups from the counter near the sink. "These will have to do."

Stella poured two glasses of wine.  She handed one to Nox and she sipped at the contents of the other plastic cup.  They watched each other, just looking at each other, almost to that awkward silence and then a knock came at the door.  Stella smiled, "Perfect timing, food is here."

Stella opened the door and a cart rolled in.  A man in a maroon jacket with gold button and black pants pushed it into the room.  Nox handed then man a twenty and he left with little word.  Nox lifted the lid and laughed.  "Romance is what you were going for?"

Stella smiled up at him, "No I figured everyone likes burgers, and they usually go well with beer."

Nox grinned, "That they do."

They sat on the couch and chatted while they ate.  Stella asked about things to see in New York - places to go if she got the job here.  They sat and talked for nearly an hour, the food was gone well before that time finished.  Aidan slept the entire time.  Stella was a good distraction, and he couldn't take his eyes off of her the whole time.  Everything about her was animated, her smile, the way her eyes shown when she was excited about something.

Nox's phone rang and he silenced it quickly as he aplogized and let Stella finish her story about meeting Aidan's father.  "He was floating through town.  Just seeing the sights, he said.  He said he stayed because of a red head.  But it turnes out when things started looking serious he wasn't much a guy for commitments."  

Nox was about to say something when his phone beeped at him repeatedly. He shook his head and pulled it from his pocket and glanced at the texts.  He sighed, "It seems I've been missed and my friend can't hold Dae'lin off anymore."

Nox stood up and Stella followed him to the door.  He grinned at her as he turned and leaned against the door, "I've enjoyed your company Ms. Stella Row."

She stopped a few feet away from him and smiled up at him, "Now you have me at a disadvantage knowing my last name."

Nox grinned, "Nox Durante."  He offered his hand and she took it softly in hers.  He raised it to his lips and brushed his lips against the middle knuckle.

He looked at her over the crest of her hand and she was blushing, Nox grinned as he straitened, "A pleasure."  

Stella held his hand a little longer and took a tentative step closer to him.  Nox smiled down at her, "I'm going to kiss you now."  As he closed the distance and leaned down to kiss her.  She received his lips with a soft sigh and the passion rose between them, Nox pulled away with a catch in his breath.  Stella's hazel eyes were still closed and Nox kissed her forehead.  "Call me after your interview, tell me how it went.  I hope to see you again soon."

Nox opened the door and started walking towards the elevator.  Stella called out, "Hey Nox.  I almost forgot."  

He turned around on his heels with a grin, "Yes?" Stella held the door as she watched him walk to the elevator. 

"Your shirt says to ask about your t-rex?"  Stella was smiling wide.

Nox laughed, "I wore it for Aidan."  Nox lifted the green t-shirt from the bottom hem over his head and growled. The inside sporting the head of a roaring t-rex. He could hear Stella laughing from her doorway.  Nox dropped the shirt with a grin.  "It was the least offensive shirt I owned." He walked backwards a few steps, "Goodnight Stella." Then he turned down the adjoining hall to the elevators.  Nox took a deep breath as he pushed the elevator button to go down.  Back to real life...
