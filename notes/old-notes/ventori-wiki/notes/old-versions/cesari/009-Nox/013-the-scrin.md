# The Scrin

Nox could stop by Jason's class now, but he decided that work before play for now.  He had a renewed reason to find the person responsible, the kid had asked.  It wasn't so much a return favor, but he looked desperate.  He was helping Nox despite the fact that the kid could get in trouble.

Nox had a new theory before he'd fallen asleep he remembered seeing a few exiles Kai and Emilio had been part of.  If Dorian's theory of an untrained Cesari was true, then they'd be the likely places to start.  It made sense really.  So Nox took the elevator to the Archives.

Once upon a time the Archives was a large library full of men and women in white robes with tomes.  Nox had never seen those days.  He'd seen books upon books, and those books and tomes were all still there, but most of the archives had been digitized.  Though they kept written records of everything as well.  The digital versions were considered the most up-to-date, as it was someone's task to record the data in the appropriate books.  Nox didn't envy that task, it was not only boring but your hand would cramp up quickly with that much information.

The Archives were much as he remembered it.  It smelled like musty books, but it was a familiar smell, he'd spent a bit of time in her researching Cesari and other supernatural things.  This was the greatest source of information for the Venatori.  Every past mission was recorded here.  Every creature known to the them had a book all to itself, some had many.  Every hunter, every Venatori were all recorded in history in this room - rooms rather.  It was an entire floor of the Bank of America building.

There was a woman at the front desk, her dark hair was pulled up into a bun, showing off her long neck and the dangling silver and emerald earrings that set off her green eyes.  Nox smiled at her as she noticed him walk up to the desk.  Her smile grew as he stood in front of her, "I didn't expect to see you here."

Nox grinned, "Why not?"

"Your father was very adamant you not be brought into this.  But you are probably one of the most tech savvy of the hunters, I expect your computers could do the work faster."  The smile never left the woman's mouth, she was kind and motherly and there was something oddly familiar about her.

"So you know who I am then, and why I'm here?"  Nox asked.

She nodded, "Yes.  Nox Durante, my son speaks highly of your abilities as both Magnus and Venatori alike."

Nox cocked his head to the side in question and she laughed softly to herself, "Dolores Vega." She offered her hand and Nox readily took it with a firm handshake and a kiss to her middle knuckle.  She smiled as she pulled her hand from his, "You know Dorian, yes?  He was the one who gave your tests."

Nox laughed, no wonder she was familiar, he could see it now.  He grinned, "Yes Dorian was the one who tested me."  Nox put his palms on the desk and smiled, "And you are just the person I need being that you are the foremost expert on the two families I'm researching."

"So you do remember who I am now?"  She laughed, "My son always said you were too bright."

Nox smiled, "That sounds very much like something Dorian would have said about me.  He has said it to me on a great many talks we had."

"What is it exactly you are looking for, Mr. Durante?"

Nox sighed, "Nox.  I'm neither Videns nor Durante, none cared enough about me so I don't care to be reminded of that, if you please."

She smiled, "Of course, Nox.  I am surprised you would come back to help a man who has nothing but ill contemptent towards you."

Nox laughed, "Dae'lin never told me before I came.  But it wouldn't have mattered anyway.  This is my life, this is what I do.  I will gladly put my life on the line to save a man who hates me as long as it means I get paid and have a good time doing it."

Dolores smiled, "You are not so unlike your father. Maybe when this is over it can be remedied.  What is it you wish to know, Nox?"

"Exuli.  My laptop took a tumble after I'd run across a few exiles Kai and your husband worked together.  They'd be the perfect place to have an untrained Cesari hiding.  I need to get those cases Kai worked with Emilio and all Exuli files we have on hand."

Dolores tapped her fingers to her lip and started moving around the desk, "Come, I think I know where you can find the information you are looking for."  She walked through a large pair of double doors and her voice lowered, "You believe my Dorian is correct then?"

Nox shrugged, "It makes sense, and he knows more about Cesari than anyone else.  I trust his judgment."

They wandered down aisles of books as Dolores continued, "You utilize the Scrin's knowledge even when it may not be convenient for you to believe.  The current theory by my husband and your father is that some sympathizers are targeting them because their names are such high profile.  They do not believe someone would take revenge upon them."

Nox smiled, "In most cases I would agree with them.  Most of their targets have been supernatural creatures, not people or creatures with strong familial ties.  This reeks of vengeance.  Those two cases are probably flukes in their repertoire of cases.  And it could be high profile names too, vengeance though I think is the name of the game."

Dolores stopped at a door and waved her hand at it, "These are the Exuli records.  Everything you need should be in here."

Nox smiled, "Thank you Mrs. Vega."  He gave her a slight bow with a grin.  "Your help has been most kind."

She smiled brightly at him, "I have heard that the Videns boy is awake, maybe you should speak with him.  I am certain your father is away at this moment.  The records will not be going anywhere, but the time to talk to the boy for you is limited."

Nox grinned, "Thank you.  I think I will do that.  I appreciate your help."  Dolores Vega left and Nox couldn't help but smile after her, she was a good woman.  And Dorian was very much like his mother.
