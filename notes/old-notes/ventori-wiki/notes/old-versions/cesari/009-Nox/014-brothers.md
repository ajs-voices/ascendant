# Brothers

There was one good thing about living at headquarters.  Everything was here including our very own hospital.  Everyone called it the Infirmary, but it was equipped to handle nearly every emergency ever thought possible.  Which was a good thing, it was hard to keep certain aspects of their physiology from the human world if they didn't have their own hospitals.

The Infirmary was one of the greatest research hospitals in the world, but only a handful of humans knew of its existence.  It was two floors of the Bank of America building dedicated to the supernatural.  

Nox knew he could get up to the Infirmary without pause, but once inside he really didn't have any idea where to go.  He asked at the front desk, an older lady sat staring at her computer screen,, "I'm looking for the Videns boy's room.  I'm family."  The words were bitter in his mouth, however true they were.

The woman looked up, "Relation?"

"He's my brother."  

The woman nodded and handed him a badge that said 'visitor' and directed him to the second floor in intensive care.  "Take care, he is awake, but don't over stress him."

Nox nodded, "Thank you."  He really had no intentions of it, but it was likely his appearance would cause issues just because of who he was.

Upstairs Nox found the boy's room, the name on the door said Nicholas Hampton, but it was the room number the lady had given him.  Nox frowned, he remembered Nick from classes.  Well from more than classes.  Nox knocked on the door and the boy lying in the bed looked over at the door and smiled, though it looked like it hurt.  There were burns covering his body where the blankets were not covering him.  

"You've looked better."  Nox joked.

Nick smiled at him, "What are you doing here?  Only family is allowed."

Nox laughed.  "Technically I'm your brother."

It took a moment to register, "Wait...but..."

Nox walked over to the side of the bed and pulled a chair over so Nick didn't have to crane his neck up at him.  "Kai is your father too, right?"

Nick nodded, "So, it's a good thing we got caught..."

Nox laughed, "I suppose that's why Dae'lin forbade it now that I think back on it."

Nick grinned, "I had hoped you were here for more intimate reasons."

"Still pining over me Nick?"  Nox winked at him, "I came for another reason."

Nick tried to laugh but it hurt and he sputtered in pain.  "I don't want to bother you Nick but can I ask you a few questions?"

Nick nodded, "Sure Father and Mr. Vega have asked me all sorts of things.  Why not another Venatori?"

Nox smiled, "Thanks.  You remember anything about the package?"

Nick took a swallow of water before he started, Nox could almost feel the pain radiating off his one-time classmate. "It was a regular package.  But it didn't look like it had come from the mailroom, but it was stamped and everything so I guess it had.  A kid handed it to me.  Had my name on it and everything."

"You don't think it came from the mailroom?"

Nick shrugged, "It was just a feeling I had, why else would a kid give it to me.  I guess it was delivered incorrectly.  It happens."

"The kid you remember who it was?  What he looked like?"

Nick shook his head, "I didn't know him.  He's new, still in high school, I think.  Dark hair, that's all I really remember."

Nox nodded, "Thanks man, I appreciate it.  Don't tell Kai I was here.  I don't want you to get in trouble with him."

Nick laughed, "Like I have a choice with who visits me.  I suspect that the ladies at the front desk and nurses stations would all get a good talking to, letting his least favorite son up here to see his youngest son."

Nox grinned, "Well I don't want them getting yelled at because of me either.  I hope you feel better man."

Nick smiled, "Thanks.  And thanks for stopping by.  It kinda sucks you are my brother.  Woulda been nice to brag that a hot guy came to visit me."

Nox laughed, "Still can, they don't have to know it was me."

"Father doesn't like the fact that I'm gay."  

Nox nodded, "Yeah I get that.  It's one of the rants he's gone on about when he's talked about me.  He probably blames me for you turning out gay."

Nick smirked, "He does.  He never says it in so many words, but when he speaks of it, it's always, if he hadn't kissed you like that, you'd be fine. I don't blame you.  You weren't even the first guy I kissed.  Just the only one I got caught kissing."  Nick added, "At least you actually like girls though."

Nox smiled, "It's not much help when it comes to Kai and so many others.  To them, I'm still gay.  Gay is gay.  But what are the odds that both of Kai's sons born the same year liked guys.  Makes you wonder what was in the air then."  Nox stood up, "I should go before Kai comes back, or someone calls him."

Nick nodded and closed his eyes.  Nox put the chair back in its place .  He walked out the door as Nick called his name, "Hey Nox."

Nox turned around to see Nick looking back at him, "Yeah?"

"Maybe when I'm outta here we can hang out.  Friends maybe, brothers definitely, go dancing, get a drink, pick up a guy or three.  I hear you are pretty good at that, picking up human guys."

Nox grinned, "Sure, soon as you are outta this joint.  Though I think the dancing and guys will have to wait till you are more functional.  Burns suck."

Nick nodded, "That's right.  A dragon right?"

"Yep.  A human fire-breathing dragon, who da thunk."  Nox smiled and waved, "I'll catch ya round bro."  The word felt foreign on his tongue when it was actually true.  Irony would have it be that he'd find out he had a brother almost exactly his age that was into guys, one he'd actually kissed.  But a brother, an honest to god brother who actually wanted to hang out with him.  That was so not normal for Nox.
