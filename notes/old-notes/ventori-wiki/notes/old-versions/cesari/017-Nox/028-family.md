# Family

The walk down to the archives was interrupted as well.  He'd gotten a call from Nate, his nephew, and the tech guru who was helping Nox out by capturing Nox's data from his busted laptop.  So instead of heading to the Archives as he'd intended he found himself in the basement "bat cave" again.

Nate was hunkered down behind his desk while a familiar frame stood in front of him, Nox's heart skipped a beat, and not in a good way.  He wasn't a praying man, but he hoped that his father was not in a bad mood, and the boy, his nephew was not at the center of the storm.

The kid looked up and frowned when he saw Nox standing in the doorway.  Kai turned around, "Fancy meeting you here."

Nox grinned, "I just came to get my destroyed harddrive data."

Nate quickly handed Nox the jump drive that he'd put all the data he had recovered on it.  He was clearly nervous, "I just copied the documents, movies, pictures and music, nothing else."  The boy turned a deep shade of red as he remembered what Nox said he'd stored on the harddrive and Nox chuckled to himself.

Kai turned around to see the boy blushing which deepened the red, "What's that all about?"  He turned and asked Nox.

Nox grinned, "I told him I had filmmed girls I'd been with."

Kai narrowed his eyes at Nox with that look that said he was deciding whether or not Nox was lying or not.  Nox grinned, "He'd said my porn was replaceable.  I informed him it was not."  

Nate started spluttering, "I... didn't.... No.  I didn't look Grandfather."

Nox laugh, "No worries, Nate.  There was nothing to find.  I promise.  Your virginity is in tact."

Nate paled, the blood leaving his face at the truth of the matter, Nox sighed, "Sorry man, didn't mean it seriously."

Kai shook his head, "You like to step in it don't you?

Nox grinned, "The more the better.  It keeps people from trying too hard to make me look the fool.  I do a damned fine job of it all on my own."  

Kai nodded for Nox to follow him out.  He turned to Nate, "Keep up the good work and thank you for that bit of tech help, it has been helpful."  Nate nodded and beamed with pride as his grandfather praised him.  Nox grinned at the kid's joy.  Kai started out the door, "You were done?"

Nox nodded, he held up the flash drive, "Just getting my harddrive."

They walked for a while in silence.  "So... Dorian?"

Nox looked at Kai with a questioning look, Kai smiled, "I'm not stupid.  Rumors run around like wild fire, I knew where you'd been when I saw you this morning." 
"Nothing happened."

Kai turned to look at Nox with a perplexed look.  "Why not?"

"I don't kiss and tell, Kai."  Nox laughed, "Since when did you become interested in my sex life?"  He shook his head not exactly expecting an answer.

Kai answered to Nox's surprise.  "Since the wife of my best friend died."

Nox nodded, "Death does that.  But why do you care now?  I'm still everything you hate about me."

Kai frowned.  "Hate is a very strong word."  There was silence as they ascended the stairs.  "They don't need more problems Nox."  Nox made to protest that he wasn't going to cause problems, but Kai held up his hand, "Let me finish first.  I know you don't intend to cause problems.  But they tend to follow you around.  Dorian is in a fragile state."

Nox had to interrupt, "That's the very reason WHY nothing happened.  I'm not stupid or uncaring and I sure as hell don't want to hurt Dorian.  I LIKE Dorian."

Kai nodded, "And I don't want you to get hurt either."  There was sadness in Kai's voice, "But that it isn't the whole truth.  Dae'lin told me what happened to you as a child."

"Fuck!"  Nox could feel the anger rising, Dae'lin couldn't keep her damned mouth shut.  "It doesn't matter, there is nothing you can do about it now."

Kai sighed, "There was and I did."

Nox stopped and Kai took a few more steps before he turned to look down at Nox.  Nox whispered, almost afraid to even ask, "What did you do?"

Kai took the few steps back down and stood in front of Nox at eye level and frowned, "He was exiled.  Dae'lin stopped me from doing what I intended to do."  Kai's anger was written all over his face.  "You and I may not get along Nox.  But you ARE my blood, and no one treats my blood the way Garret treated you."

Nox turned in a hasty movement and started up the stairs two at a time.  Kai caught up to him on the landing and took Nox by the arm, "You aren't alone anymore, stop acting like a child."

Nox rolled his eyes, "I am alone, because of shit like this.  I had Garrett handled.  I have every right as Venatori to kill him, and if he ever touched a child I would have done it.  Dae'lin was confided in, and she tells you, the one person who doesn't give a damn about me.  And you go and handle things out of what? Pity?"

Kai shook his head, "It wasn't pity.  It was my fault."

Nox laughed, "How do you figure?  You didn't know I existed for another 13 years."

Kai sighed, "Because I didn't know about you.  I didn't protect you from shit bags like that."

Nox shook his head, "You'd have seen me dead."

"You are wrong.  You don't choose blood.  But Blood is what makes the Venatori strong."  Kai continued with a sigh, "I know I've been wrong."  He took Nox by the shoulders and made him look at him.  "I want to be there for your children.  That wasn't all Dae'lin told me.  She told me you would leave if the council didn't agree to your terms.  Remove yourself from everything here.  Your terms will be met, with a few additional ones impinged upon them."

Nox raised his eyebrow, "What did you do?"

Kai shook his head, "Nothing to be concerned about, and yes I made presumptions, but I can do that."

"Why? because you are my father?"  Nox said dryly.

Kai laughed, "Well yes, but more importantly because they owe me a favor."

Nox shook his head, "You wasted a favor on me?"

Kai grinned and put his arm around Nox, "It's not a waste.  Do your duty, and you'll be set.  No one will presure you again if we get Cesari we get Cesari, if we get nothing, then well we've lost nothing.  We tried is all we can say."  He smiled it was heart warming.  "This is me."  He indicated the floor they were on, "I want to do right by yours when I knew nothing of you.  Please think about it."

Nox grinned, "There is nothing to think about Kai.  They are your line even if I don't like you much."  He winked at him and Kai laughed as he left through the landing door.  Nox took the stairs two at a time back to the Archives.
