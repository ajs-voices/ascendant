# Family Matters

Nox was not looking forward to finding his father.  He'd missed the all-hands meeting, granted he was busy, but Kai wasn't going to see it as anything but defiance.  Even if Emilio stood up for him.  As they walked past the common area Nox's stomach rumbled, he realized he hadn't eaten anything except the piddly amount of food he had gotten before Aaron had thrown his plate across the table.  He sighed.  They passed a vending machine and Nox grabbed a power bar from its wares.  He hated the things, but he needed something to eat.

They found Kai just as Nox finished the last bite of the dry piece of food that constituted his only meal of the day.  Kai was glaring at him.  He looked like he was ready to spit nails.  Nox grinned at his father.

Emilio took a side step between them, "He was with me the whole time."

Kai looked at his friend with the same look.  "Why?"

"Because I asked him to comb through data since you insisted upon an all-hands meeting.  Did you find anything?"  It was funny watching Emilio stand up to Kai's aggressive behavior.  It was odd seeing anyone standing up to Kai.

"Emilio this is family business.  Why did you bring _him_ in?"  Nox watched the vein in Kai's throat throb as his temper rose.  Nox saw the patterns shifting and took a step back.

Emilio didn't seem bothered by the rise in his friends blood pressure.  Nox wondered if he even noticed the change.  "He IS family.  He's your son.  He's in as much danger as the rest of us."  Kai's anger rose and the fire patterns became more erratic.  Emilio stood there oblivious to the changes that could become deadly if Kai let loose what he was building.  But the man stood his ground, "Did you find anything?"

Kai stared past his friend at Nox.  "He's not family."

Nox fought the urge to grin at his father to incite his rage.  It was difficult to manage, but he did, he stood his ground and didn't make it worse.  He should get points for that he thought to himself.  Nox interrupted the battle of wills, "Emilio and I saw the same kid with the sox hat give Mrs. Vega a package."

Kai blinked and Nox could see the rage die with each one.  "Whoever owns that hat we need to find them."

Nox nodded, "Yes."

Kai blinked again this time in confusion like he didn't' believe Nox was agreeing with him.  He stepped around his friend and closed the distance between him and his son.  It was a threatening gesture, but Kai said nothing just stared at him.  Nox couldn't help but grin back at his father, he wasn't afraid of him.  There was nothing Kai Videns could do that would scare Nox, nothing that the bullies in school hadn't already inflicted upon him.  Nox dared not blink, it could mean being beaten by the man who already hated him for being half human.

Nox didn't have to worry for much longer as Emilio pulled his friend away by the arm, "We'll start in the boy's dormitory.  Nicholas said it was a kid."

Kai turned back to look at Nox, "_He_ tell you that?  I didn't tell you."

Emilio nodded, "Yes.  Come Kai.  We've a lot of rooms to search.  Nox, we could use your assistance."

Kai started to splutter something, but Emilio interrupted before he got even the first sound out of his mouth, "We need all the hands we can get.  My children will assist, I've already sent them texts to meet us in the boy's dormitory.  Dae'lin is coordinating other Venatori to assist.   Your four eldest have been called in as well.  Only those we can trust without a doubt have been called in."

Kai looked back at Nox as they walked, Emilio sighed, "You don't trust him.  I do not know the boy well enough, but Dae'lin trusts him.  And we trust her, do we not?"

Kai sighed, "Yes.  Though her actions as of late make me reconsider that trust."

They continued to carry on their conversation about trust and family, Nox lost interest about a quarter of the way through, he was thinking about everything on the case.  The pieces of the puzzle that had been thrown together hastily.  They knew the kid was connected to both bombings.  Nick had said he was new.  Dorian thought the culprit was Cesari because the bombs were made with all the elements but were they used at the same time?  Did it matter?  He was missing something, it pulled at his memory like a moth to the flame.
