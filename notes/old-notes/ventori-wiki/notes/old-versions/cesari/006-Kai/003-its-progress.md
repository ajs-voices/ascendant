# It's Progress

Kai woke from a happy dream.  He wasn't sure he remembered the details but he felt good waking up.  It was a rare thing.  The papers slid from his chest and he rememberd what he'd fallen asleep doing.  Maybe it was about his least known son, maybe not, but it didn't matter.

Kai headed to the gym and did his morning routine before hitting the shower.   As Kai was pulling the green t-shirt over his head a knock came at his front door.  Good timing, at least he wasn't dripping wet in the shower.

Kai walked out to the front door his bare feet making a soft sound against the flooring.  The knock came again as Kai opened the door.  A small man stood in front of the door ready to knock again, he pulled his hand back to his side a little embarrassed.  "Yes?"

"Mr. Viddens.  Ms. Rivera sent us out after a vamp you were looking for."  He spoke calmly but Kai could see the nerves, he fidgetted with his fingers, clenching and opening his fist like he was ready to punch something. 

Kai waved for the man to come in.  He did but he only took two steps inside before he turned around and started speaking, "We found a few nests and took note of them.  I know it's only a day since you asked for help.  But we found something ... different.  I think there's a vamp living on campus."

There were quite a few campus in New York City so he had to ask, "Which one?"

"Columbia I think it was.  There were some read rumors going around.  I followed one but I didn't see any major evidence of vamps in the area."  

Kai nodded, "Alright."  Kai went over to a drawer and pulled out a paper and pen, "Jot down the address and the rumors that you followed.  I'll get Emilio and we'll go see what we can find."

The man wrote down what he thought pertenant and nodded to Kai, "I hope it helps.  And I'm sorry to hear about your kid.  Shit damn luck."

Kai nodded thanking the man for his condolences.  He was glad to hear that no one had any real idea of what was going on, at least some rumors were staying secret for the time being.  No one would panic as long as they thought it was bad luck that Nick had gotten a package that blew up.  Though it made Kai wonder what people really thought was going on.

Kai headed towards the common area to grab some food.  He overheard a young man talking smack.  Kai watched the black man who looked like he lived in the gym.   A much smaller boy with a nice tan, almost looked fake, spoke to the big black man, "I heard the little fag Nox was back in town.  Came back crawling to get into the breeding program I hear it."

Kai smirked at the obvious lie and he wondered if he should step in.  He backed around the corner to listen.  The big black man's voice was deep, "I hear he came back to pick up where he and Hill left off - married or no."

There were several other things being thrown around about Nox and who he came back to shag, one of them actually used that word too.  Kai hadn't heard sex referenced as shagging in ages.  They headed off into the cafeteria and Kai shook his head as he followed them in.
