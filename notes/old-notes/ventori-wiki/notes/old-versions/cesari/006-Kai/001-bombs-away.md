# Bombs Away

Kai watched the train wreck in front of him.  At least that's what it felt like, it was horrible yet he couldn't turn away.  Kai had never seen Dae'lin get so flustered, he was kinda proud that it was his son doing the flustering.  She always seemed so cool and calm, but he sent her into fits of spluttering.  Of course dousing her in water probably would have had that affect on anyone.

And true to Dorian's word, the boy started poking away at the bomb.  But it wasn't so much what he did at first that was intriquing.  For Kai listening to the way his son spoke for the first time made him realize that maybe the boy was all bluster and not really like all the rumors said he was.

Sure he was still loud and obnoxious, so was he.  But the rumors said he was reckless and didn't care.  They said that his son was nothing but trouble.  And here the boy sat telling Dorian about what he saw.  He didn't talk down to the man who was clearly not on his talent level.  And even when Dorian acknowledge the fact that he couldn't see what he did, his instruction came with care.

Kai actually tried what he said and when Dorian exclaimed Kai lost his train of thought.  But he had seen something different.  Something he hadn't thought to do, he'd seen the intracies of the base pattern, why anyone would want to or need to look so deep he didn't know.  Apparently Nox had some knowledge about the pattern he didn't quite understand.

And then he asked if Dorian wanted to be present while he literally poked at the bomb.  Dorian only smiled and remained seated, he looked like a child in a candy shop.  This was what the Scrin lived for.  Not just Dorian, but any Scrin.  They had their niches in research and study.  And for Dorian, his niche was Kai's son - rather children and Magnus like his son, Cesari - men and women who could bend all four elements.

Kai couldn't see most of the bubble Nox had created around the box, it was made of mostly air he assumed, but it was interlaced with earth.  How the kid saw anything through the pattern he didn't know.  It was so tightly woven that there couldn't be anything else to see.  

But Kai could see enough of it and he watched as Nox poked the bomb with the perverbial stick.  It was made from earth and he literally poked the box with it.  I looked like a little finger floating in he air and it would move in and poke certain areas.  Kai wished he could see what he was doing beyond the earth.  He doubted the boy would use fire at all, that could prove to be highly dangerous.

Nox looked up and stared at the mirror on his side of the room again, he shook his head and looked to Dorian, "Someone's on the otherside aren't they?"

Dorian nodded, "Yeah.  The usual."

Nox frowned, "This isn't some test is it?"

Dorian shook his head, "No.  Not a test.  Truly there are no more tests.  This is work.  They are only curious."

Nox poked the box with the stick again, the cardboard was bending inward, he wasn't watching anything but the reflection in the mirror.  He smiled, "You'd have a better view from here.  I promise I won't set it off."

Dorian looked at his son with a frown, "I don't think they are ready to trust you quite that far yet."  

Kai sighed and got up from the chair he'd been lounging in and walked around to the other door.  It felt like a mile long walk.  He wasn't ready to confront his failures in the boy.  Maybe it wouldn't become personal.  Maybe... just maybe they could work this one thing together without cause for issue.

He opened the door and the boy looked at him.  Kai couldn't read his expression.  He had that stupid grin on his face, the one he wanted to smack to wipe off.  Dorian put his hand on Nox's knee and Nox turned his attention to the youngest Vega.  His smug grin turned to a smile and he went back to poking the box with earth.  

Kai shut the door and Dorian spoke, "Tell me what you are doing or tyring to do."

There was little hesitation in the boy's response - almost like this was a test and Dorian was still his instructor.  It was an interesting phenomeon to watch.  Everything he'd heard about his son said the opposite.  

"I'm trying to see if there are any pressure points on the box itself.  Opening it clearly is a trigger, just wondering if there is something more.  I'm watching how the patterns react as I poke them in different places in the pattern."

Kai was a little taken aback by that, "You said you wouldn't let it blow up?"

Nox grinned, "Well... I will try not to let it blow up?"  He shrugged then turned to look at him.  Kai felt the weight of several tons fall straight on his shoulders.  Nox asked, "What do you see?"

Kai shrugged, "Only half of what you do and not nearly the details I'm sure."

Nox nodded, "Earth and Fire, right?"  He didn't really wait for Kai to answer him, just continued talking like he had answered yes.  "Water is hard to see.  Think in colors.  Red for fire, brown for earth.  Blue is water, Green or yellow can be air.  Try looking for the other colors."  Nox started drawing with fire in what appeared to be random twists and turns around the fire and earth patterns Kai did see.  "This is vaguely what the air looks like."  

It was litearlly almost like magic, once the pattern had been started Kai could finish it, the light tint of green started to color the view of the box.  "Who do you get past the bubble of air?"

Dorian spoke this time, "It just takes practice.  Focus past it, like you are taking a picture of something just the other side of it."

It slowly cleared from his view and he could see the patterns.  He couldn't see details and when he tried the first instructions of the zoom he lost air.  Kai shook his head.  He looked at his son who was watching him.  The boy smiled, "It's alright, that's pretty good for your first time seeing air."

He turned back towards the box.   And he started drawing with fire.  The small lines of light etched into Kai's retnia and the afterimage added to the pattern te boy was creating.  He drew what he was seeing, probably for him, but he wondered how much was for Dorian.  

He spoke about how the peices fell into place, how each one connected and how it was unstable.  He was afraid to pull at the pattern, so intead of trying to destroy it, he started strengthening it.  Putting in the structure that the patterns lacked.  

An hour passed and he'd completed his so-called puzzle.  And then with one quick tug of earth and fire, and probably all the other elements too, every one of the patterns on the box dissintegrated into near nothingness.  Nox removed the bubble of air and earth and then started to open the box.  Both Dorian and Kai stood up quickly, their chairs crashing to the floor one after the other.  

Nox only grinned as he lifted the lid to the box and looked inside.  There was only a peice of paper inside.  With a typed message. "Boom!  I hope your family liked my little surprise -A"

No one touched the paper and Nox had used his gift to actually open the box.  Kai smiled, "Maybe forensics can pick something up from that." 

Nox nodded.  "In the mean time I'm going to go through some files see if I can pull any connections."  Dorian nodded and turned to watch as Nox walked out the door.  He was tall and thin and Kai was surprised he'd passed anything physcial in his acadmeics going up against Venatori who could snap him like a twig.

Dorian interrupted his train of thought, "You didn't have to come in here, he would have survived without knowing."

Kai shook his head, "A sixth sense like his old man.  I could always tell when someone was watching me too."

Dorian smiled, "It's a good talent to have when you hunt.  I will take this down to the labs and see what they can find.  I do hope that watching him was enlightening."

"It was, didn't think I could learn new tricks."

Dorian laughed, "Neither did I, neither did I."  Dorian left with the box and head for the lab.  Kai picked up the chairs and turned off the lights as he walked out the door closing it behind him.  It had definiately been interesting watching his son work.
