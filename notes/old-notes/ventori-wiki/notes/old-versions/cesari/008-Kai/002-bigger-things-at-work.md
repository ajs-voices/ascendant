# Bigger Things At Work

Kai went out the window, knocking the glass with the cuff of his jacket before hoping the ceil and heading out after whatever had done that.  If it went out the window it was not likely a vampire, but if daywalkers were real it could be.  Kai had never seen a day walker, nor had one ever been recorded.  So this was just as much a mystery.  Kai didn't like the idea of tracking this thing alone, but they had to do something it if it could rip apart a whole room in such a short time period.

It was harder to track in the city.  But that was where Kai was best at, where his ability came in handy. The more people he could read the more likely he'd find what he was looking for.  His ability was unstable, and hardly useful but it always seemed to be there when he needed it most.  Maybe it was just lack of training.  Since not every Venatori had the same gift or same way of accessing them it was not really trained it was a fly by the seat of your pants type learning.

But it was always there.  It wasn't so much seeing the future, but seeing possiblities.  Kai could track the creature through the city with that possibility.  It was like that movie Next with Nicholas Cage, he could catch a glimpse of the future, only a small glimpse but the possiblities were endless.  It was quick and happened in a moment and Kai could see the possibilities.  Some with visions like his actually used it to make money to fool the humans into thinking they were fortune tellers or such.  Kai was a hunter, he thought that was foolish.

Kai followed his instincts through the streets of New York, which really wasn't far.  He found himself in front of an exposed man-hole. He hated to jump down there alone, but he did it anyway.  Maybe he could use the patterns like Nox, he might actually have to talk to his son about that, how he could call the patterns so easily.  Kai envisioned the patterns and climbed down the steel ladder into the darkness below.

All sort of sights and sounds caught him off guard, the patterns were talking to him in ways he'd never imagined.  It was almsot confusing.  Kai steadied himself as his feet touched the soggy floor.  The visions passed in a blur but he had a strong feeling, his gut lead him right.  Kai walked the tunnels underneath the city like he knew his way around completely.  He'd been down there several times but to say he knew his way was not true, but today he seemed to know exactly where he was going.

Kai came to an intersection of the tunnel and he heard a noise.  It sounded like someone panting and scratching the walls as they moved through the damp tunnel.  Kai moved slowly.  He found himself following a shadow.  It smelled worse the closer he came, the place reaked of death and decay.  

The shadowed figure turned and Kai could see the pale skin of Bernstein nearly glowing in the dim light.  The vampire smiled at him, the fangs dripped with blood, his mouth was covered in the remains of some poor child he'd killed.  The once white shirt he wore under the black jacket was soaked red it was crimson and nearly stuck to the creature's human like chest as if he'd entered a wet t-shirt contest.

"How kind of you to bring me one last meal."  His voice was gravely.  It made Kai shiver.  He could feel the vampire trying to lure him into his embrace.   Kai struggled but he knew his own mind, knew that the vamp was trying to control him, that knowledge alone gave him the power over the vampire's mezmerizing gaze.

Kai looked down and laughed, "I didn't come to feed you."

The vampire laughed, "So you would be the one who hunts me.  I'd like to see you try alone."  And in the blink of the eye the vampire flew past Kai at the speed of light, or darkness rather.  It was gone with a parting comment, "There are bigger things at work than you could possibly know Hunter.  You shall perish the next time we meet."

Kai didn't like the encounter, or the fact that he'd found a vampire who could possibly walk the day.  It was a scary thought, the cryptic message rang through his head as he walked back to the surface. 

Every tunnel felt the same, every turn got Kai farther lost until at least he found daylight and wound his way up to the street level.  It was much later now.  Kai wondered how long he'd been in the bowels of the city.  He'd have to clock it later, for now he was more interested in getting home.  He should go see Nick, maybe talk to Nox.  But more importantly he needed a shower.
