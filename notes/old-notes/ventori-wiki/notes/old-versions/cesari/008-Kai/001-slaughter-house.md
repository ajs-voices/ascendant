# Slaughter House

Kai hadn't know Nox would be there, he'd watched his son stand up to the bullies, he watched him leave the cafeteria standing tall.  The big black man looked winded and Kai felt bad for him.  He stepped up to a boy who could have wiped the floor with him.  Nox was smaller, sure, but his gift gave him the upper hand, and he'd waited for the right moment.  No one was going to say he was the bully.  The boy was smart he'd give his son that.

Kai grabbed a meal.  The woman, Sheila he thought her name was, smiled at him fondly and with a knowing smile, but she said nothing more than enjoy your meal.  He wondered what was going through her head. 

Kai sat down at an empty table and pulled out his phone.  He gave Emilio a call as he took a bite of toast, "Hey.  Good news, might have a line on Bernstein, care to go hunting while the day is still early?"

Emilio agreed before he hung up the phone.  Kai would meet him up at the his apartment as soon as he finished his meal.  Breakfast was important, and it might be the only meal he got today.

It wasn't long before Emilio and Kai were walking aroud the Columbia University campus heading to the place that their friend had found.  Turns out it was a local hangout for serveral different organizations.  They walked in and the smell of death hit them almost immediately.  Kai drew his gun from his shoulder holster under his jacker, Emilio did the same thing.  Bullets did little against a vampire, but silver worked on most any being, even if they were expensive.  It was the safest bet in any situation.

Their gear was left in the car they'd taken from the compound, it didn't make sense to bring things with them they might not need when out in daylight and in the middle of a campus full of twenty-somethings.

Their friend had only been gone a few hours, he hadn't said anything was wrong when he told Kai, he wondered if the vamp had controlled him.  Or if there was something else going on.  Kai slide one door open and the stench of decay wafted through the opening.

On the other side of the door Kai saw a fallen body, lying crumpled on the floor.  Kai could see the throat ripped out, and the blood still oozing from the gapping wound.  Emilio looked in and frowned.  Kai pushed the door open the rest of the way, he had to shove the door rather hard to open it enough to get inside.  The room was littered with bodies of boys and girls wearing fancy labled clothes, Kai shook his head, "It looks like someone slaughtered and Abercrombie & Fitch catalog."

Emilio rolled his eyes at him and Kai chuckled, it was an inside joke.  Emilio had once upon a time shopped specifically from those very same catalogs.  He beleived that his son Eli still did as did his children.  Sahara took after her mother in that respect, wearing what was functional before it was cool.  Dorian on the other hand went the completely opposite direction, everything was tailor made for that Vega.  His own children spanned the lower end faovoring hitting the mall.  Kai's tastes had changed over the years as his stature increased in size both height and his overall status among the venatori he could afford better things.  

A sound brought Kai out of his thoughts as a body on the bottom of a pile started to move.  Emilio rushed over to help the girl, she was small.  She barely looked old enough to be in college.  She was covered in blood though none of it looked to be hers.

She frowned at the sight around her and started to sob.  They wouldn't get much from her he was sure.  He'd take her back to HQ and see what she had to say.  But first they had to clear the building.  Emilio noted the broken window to the outside.  "Wasn't a vamp."  Emilio turned the girl, "You see what did this?"

The girl shook her head, "You wouldn't beleive me if I told you."

Kai put his arm around the girl, "Just the one?  Or were there more?"

She sobbed into Kai's shoulder, "I only saw one."

Emilio nodded, "Alright, I will take you someplace safe for now.  Kai you are the better tracker."

Kai nodded, "Right.  I'll see you back at home."
