# Fancy Dinner

They rounded the corner there were any number of food joints on Mulberry Street, it was after all Little Italy, for which Nox was actually grateful for, it was one thing he'd missed when he was out west.  He could get great Mexican food, but Italian, not so much.

They past several little places that would have suited Nox's tastes just fine, but when they stopped in front of the would-be maroon awning of Pellegrino's Nox was surprised.  Dorian had fine tastes, but it was a bit too fine for Nox's pay check.  But he didn't object when Dorian opened the door for him.  Nox felt as Dorian's hand slide along the small of his back as he walked in front of the other man.  Such a small gesture and Nox was melting already at his touch.  This was going to be an interesting night.

The hostest greet Dorian with surprise, "Didn't you just leave?"

Dorian laughed, "My friend is hungry, I figured I could use another bottle of wine and keep him company."

She smiled, "Right this way Mr. Vega."

The woman lead them to a table, they were almost at capacity even this late at night.  It was a wonder that the city that never sleeps really was like this even this late at night.  Nox would have to readjust his expectations of life again if he intended to stay in the City.

They sat down and the woman left menus with them.  Dorian picked up the wine menu, "You have any preferences?"

Nox laughed, "I'll trust your judgement, I'm more a beer kinda guy."

Dorian smiled, "We can go elsewhere."

Nox shook his head, "Here is fine.  I missed good Italian food."  Nox opened the menu and browesed, glancing at the prices and tried not to react to them.  It wasn't uncommon to spend more than he'd like on a date, but this wasn't exactly a date either.

Their waitor came to the table, "I am Miguel, I will be your server today.  Can I start you off with anything?"

Dorian spoke calmly, "We'll have a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  I'll poke at his plate while I wait for desert."  He smiled at Nox and Nox couldn't help but laugh.

"You think I'm sharing?" He grinned playfully at Dorian.

Miguel smiled and looked to Nox expectantly, "Are you ready to order?"

"Yeah, I'll start off with Mozzarella Della Casa."

"And your meal?"

Nox smiled, "Pollo Pastore."

Dorian nodded approvingly at Nox's choices when Miguel left Dorian smiled, "Couldn't have done better myself."

Nox grinned, "Ain't my first rodeo.  Though I do hope they bring something quickly, I'm starving."

Dorian asked, "You forget to eat today?"

"Something like that.  Just busy I didn't think about it until I went looking for Kai with your father."  Nox sighed, "He's a power horse.  I don't think I could have picked up directly after my loved one died.  Not like he did."

Dorian sighed, "He will power through it until it's over and then he'll crash.  I think we all will.  None of us have felt the pain yet, I know I haven't.  How did you manage, when you lost your mother?"

Nox shrugged, "I wasn't close to my mother.  I got through it with relatively little pain.  I only have guilt for the circumstances really.  If I'd done my job properly, if I'd not let her superior old school philosphy overrule my judgement.  If J were to go, or Dae'lin or even you, that would be something else entirely.  My family is not one of blood."

Dorian smiled, "I'm family?"

Nox laughed, "Closest I've come to it anyway."

Dorian sighed, "That doesn't bode well for this..."  He waved his hand over the table, "Whatever this is."

Nox grinned, "And there is doubt to what this is?"  He winked.

"You have none?"  Dorian asked a smile playing on his face.

"The night is still young."  Nox replied as Dorian did.  The waitor arrived with a basket of freshly baked bread, Nox could see the steam rolling off the top and the heat patterns distorting and cooling around it.  His mouth started watering.  He looked up at Miguel, "My you are a god."  He winked at Dorian and took a peice of bread before the basket even hit the table.

Dorian chuckled, "Don't mind my friend here, he's been starving himself all day just to fit into those lovely jeans of his."

Nox laughed, nearly chocking on the bread he had bitten into.  The waitor left in a hurry as if he'd gotten more than he bargained for at their table.  Nox finished chewing, "You scared him away."  Nox winked at Dorian, "So my jeans..."  He left it hanging on purpose and watched the scarlet color rise in Dorian's cheeks before he took a sip of his water.  Nox grinned and took another bite of the warm peice of bread.  He swallowed and change the topic, "Do you see the patterns around the bread?"

Dorian adjusted in his chair, the interest in the topic peaking his curiousity in a way that flirting hadn't, Nox smiled at the fact.  Dorian strained, Nox could tell he was focusing intently on the cooling bread, he finally nodded, "Yeah, they look like they are dissipating though."

Nox nodded, "They are cooling down.  That's how it looks around people, except it oscillates, Kai who bends fire and earth, he'll oscillate pretty steadily between attracking fire and earth.  Indicating he actually is as strong in both.  Jason.  He's changed a little since I was here last.  He is strong in Air and earth, but he's got a little fire and a small oscilation of water now too."

Dorian nodded, "You should sit in his class one day and listen to him speak.  I won't do his theory justice, but it's pretty simple.  If you can train your eye to see the patterns, you can manipulate them all to some degree or another.  You inspired him."

Nox smiled, "So that means you can manipulate all the elements?"

Dorian shrugged, "Can't teach an old dogs new tricks."

Nox laughed, "I bet I could teach you a few new tricks."  He winked.  "You've seen them far longer than anyone else and say you can only just touch Air.  I think you are your own interferrance."

Dorian smiled, "Perhaps, but I will stick to my guns."

"You are no fun."  Nox pouted.

The waitor brought out the anti-pasto Nox had ordered.  He set the plate down in the middle of the table and placed a plate in front of each of them.  Dorian nodded to him in thanks.  The fresh buffalo and smoked mozzarella, tomato, roasted peppers and basil looked to die for, almost too pretty to eat.  Nox didn't waste much time taking a bit of the dish to his own plate.

A second waitor came bearing gifts, well not really, the wine was presented to Dorian and he nodded, the server poured two glasses and Dorian took small sip and savored it.  Nox watched Dorian test the wine to his satisfaction.  The man left the bottle sitting on the table.  Nox took a sip of the wine, he'd never been a fan of wine, but it was fruity on his palatte and Nox smiled.  He couldn't say much about the wine.  

He couldn't help it really, his stomach growled with the food sitting on his plate, he gave Dorian an apologetic smile, "Sorry, starving."  He didn't wait any longer before popping a peice of the to die for mix in his mouth.  The first bit was heaven.  God he was hungry, but this was too much to ask for.  He probably should have just gone for burgers and fries.  A 'romantic' dinner with a guy he'd known his whole life wasn't exactly what he wanted to do when he was starving.

Dorian nibbled at a very small portion of the anti-pasto dish, he grinned while he watched Nox polish off the food and the bread that was on their table.  Dorian laughed when Nox was chewing the last peice of bread left as he looked around for more food, "You'd think they starved you for months."

Nox laughed.  "I ... Well that's kinda true.  I have to remember to eat.  I tend to do this a lot."

Dorian shook his head, "We'll have to fix that while you stay here."

Nox raised an eyebrow, "Oh?"

Miguel brought out the plate of chicken, it looked decedant.  Nox's mouth started to water as the man placed the new plate in front of him.   He deftly took the other plates away and asked, "More bread?"

Nox looked to Dorian who just smiled, Nox grinned up at their waitor, "Yes, please."

Dorian chuckled.  As Miguel left, "Eat.  I'm enjoying the entertainment."

Nox laughed, "Entertainment?  Oh, you mean me."  Nox flourished a sitting bow, "Happy to entertain."

Dorian smiled as he poured another glass of wine for himself.  Nox had hardly touched his.  He took a swallow as Dorian set the bottle back on the table.  They spoke more about patterns between mouthfuls of Nox's meal.  Dorian nibbled ever so patiently on a peice of warm bread.  He was staring at it watching the patterns.  "Try to warm it."

Dorian looked up from his concentration, "What?  Sorry I ..."

Nox grinned, "Try to warm it.  It's already warm.  Make it warmer."

Dorian shook his head, "Old dog, new tricks."

Nox laughed he put his hand across the table on Dorian's and smiled, "Oh come on.  Try.  You see the pattern, strengthen it.  Replicate it, enhance it.  I know you know what I mean.  You teach kids how to do this everyday."

Dorian sighed, "You won't let it be?"

Nox grinned, "Fat chance.  Please?  Just once."

Dorian nodded, "I suppose."  Nox watched Dorian with intense pleasure and curiousity.  He sometimes wished he could delve into the minds of others and watch things from their perspective and get a better understandind of how they saw thing.  Sweat started to form on Dorian's brow but the patterns strengthened and Dorian dropped the too warm peice of bread on to his plate.  He looked over at Nox with a half smile, half frown.  "I suppose you are right."

Nox grinned happily and patted Dorian's hand, "I knew you could do it."  Dorian entwined his fingers into Nox and smiled.

Nox finished eating the delightful meal his fingers entwined with Dorian's across the table.  They spoke more about patterns, about how Jason was teaching the younger generations that even though they were only graded upon their natural ability they could learn all the elements.  Dorian claimed there were a few genuis' among the younger generations, those who would rival the best benders and creators they had.

Nox finished the last bite and they sat for several minutes before Miguel came to clear the plate, "Will there be anything else?"  the waitor asked.

Nox looked to Dorian who smiled at him then turned to the waitor, "The fruit tart."  

He turned to Nox, "The same and coffee please."

Dorian raised an eyebrow when the waitor left with their desert order.  "Am I that much of a lush?"

Nox laughed, "No, coffee and desert is a usual for me."

Dorian chuckled, "Where as I am having more wine."  He winked at Nox.  "At least one us will be sober enough."

"Enough for what?"  Nox grinned playfully.

Dorian winked and that was all Nox was getting for an answer as Dorian changed the subject, "So what will we do afterwards?  Going back to the compound doesn't seem overly desirable to me right now."

Nox smiled, "What would you like to do, Dorian?  I'm sure I can make suggestions to appeal to your desires."

Dorian smiled, "Surprise me."

Nox laughed, "That could end very badly my friend.  Be thankful my tastes are not quite as esoteric as Jason's.  Or you might find yourself in the middle of an orgie."

Dorian chocked on his wine as he fought back laughter and slight embarrassment if the color of his face was any indication.  When he regained his composure Dorian smiled, "Jason's got interesting tastes.  I assume you went along willingly?"

Nox smiled, "Of course.  What's an outcast to do if he's offered fun and games with a friend where noone knows him."

Dorian's smiled straightened, "Do you miss it?"

Nox shrugged, "I don't miss running around with J making childish mistakes.  I did miss my friend though.  We had some good times.  Even if he dragged me to off the wall places as his wing man."

Dorian laughed, "He's grown up too, since you left.  He didn't have anyone to drag around, and then Mia snagged her fingers into him and he calmed down even more."

"Jason, had been willing years before to calm down for Mia.  Mia wasn't ready.  Their on again off again relationship wore them both down."

Dorian squeezed Nox's fingers with his own, "Leaving you behind."

"Nah.  I left."

Dorian shook his head, "No you didn't leave willingly, you left because of the push for progeny, Mark knew what would happen the moment you came of age."

Nox nodded, "A fight for my heir.  I'm surprised Dae'lin won.  She's not exactly the family type."

The tarts arrived with Nox's coffee.  It was sweet and decedant, and Nox truly enjoyed the final part of his meal.  He couldn't have asked for a better meal, or a better companion for the time.  He smiled at Dorian as they continued to discuss the act of progeny.

Dorian sighed, "The dowager I've been asked by has decided it must be soon, this cycle she says.  I don't suppose I can put it off any longer."

Nox gave Dorian a look of sympathy, "If I could help you I would."

Dorian smiled, "Perhaps you can."  Nox raised an eyebrow in question as he popped the last peice of tart crust in his mouth. "Join me."

Nox blinked back at Dorian, he could feel the blood rising in all parts of his body, he leaned forward and whispered, "You just asked me to have a threesome with you?  That's not exactly first date material."

Dorian laughed, "Is this a first date?"

Nox could feel the blood rise to his ears and he took a deep breath, "It might as well be considering..."

Dorian added, "Considering we've been flirting all night, and holding hands and..."

Nox laughed, "Talking about ..."

Miguel chose that moment to place a black receipt folio on the table.  He had no idea what they were talking about, "Will there be anything else?"

Dorian shook his head, "No.  Thank you."  Dorian's eyes never left Nox's.  When the man left Dorian spoke, "You didn't answer my invitation."

Nox stood up and walked around the table and stood in front of Dorian.  He pulled the man's hand to indicate he wanted him to stand up.  Dorian did as requested his shoulder running up the length of Nox's body sending a chill through Nox.  They stood impossibly close and looked into each other's eyes, "Let's see how this plays out first?  I will not accept or refuse if that's okay with you?"

Dorian smiled as he pulled his wallet from his back pocket.  Nox watched the grace in which Dorian moved.  He dropped an untold amount of cash on the table, "You didn't even look at the bill."  Nox whispered.

Dorian leaned forward and laid his lips carefully on Nox's and whispered, "I didn't have to, you are worth the expense and he deserves the large tip for putting up with us."  Dorian pressed his lips to Nox's and Nox let a small sound escape from the warmth of the other man's lips.  He could taste the tart and the wine on Dorian's lips.  His tongue mingled with Dorian's and when they broke the kiss they were both breathless.  Dorian smiled, "Your counter proposal is accepted.  What shall we do now?"

Nox grinned and brushed his lips against Dorian's cheek to his ear, "I get to surprise you remember."
