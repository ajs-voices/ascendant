# Unexpected

Nox shook his head to clear the lingering images of Stella leaving, a baby on her hip and her carry on bags dragging behind her.  He hadn't expected to be picked up by a girl at the airport.  He stood and headed towards the baggage claim, where he knew he'd have issues, he always had issues with his more violent gear.  But thankfully he didn't have the same issues as most Venatori since his primary weapon was his gift.

At the baggage claim he saw a familiar sight, he grinned and shook his head.  A sign read, "Nawt Ghay" held by a blonde man wearing a pair of dark sunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His jeans were washed out and tattered and his t-shirt was a faded american flag.  Nox stood at the baggage claim carousel and grabbed his bag and then turned and stared at the man with the 'Not Gay' sign laughing to himself and shaking his head.

A small hand tugged at his shirt as he turned to see who was pulling on him.  He grinned at Aidan.  Stella looked back at him, "You know him?"

Nox grinned, "I should claim that I don't."

"Does he realize what his sign says?  Or did someone put him up to it?"

"No one put him up to it."  Nox offered his hand to Stella with a grin.  "I'm not gay.  It's an inside joke between us.  He's my best friend.  Apparently he's here to pick me up."

As another man passed the sign, you could hear Jason ask, "Not Gay?"

The passing man turned and looked at him with a confused look.  Nox laughed and walked up to his friend.  "I'm not gay."  

People turned and looked and stared and Nox couldn't hide the grin that said it was all a big joke.  Nox hugged his friend with little care of the new looks he was receiving.  "I didn't expect you here."

Stella walked up next to him with Aidan in her arms, Nox nodded her direction, "J, this is Stella and Aidan.  Stella, this is my best friend Jason Hill.  He thinks he's funny."

Jason laughed, "I don't think, I know."

Nox rolled his eyes with a sideways grin.  Jason turned to Stella then back to Nox, "You just make the most gorgeous friends don't you?"

Nox grinned, "She asked me out."

Stella blushed.  Nox's grin widened, "But really it's the kid that did it.  He crawled all over me.  I saw her tactics coming a mile away."

Jason laughed, "Stella, do you need a ride?  Got a car seat and everything for the little tike."

Stella nodded, "I was going to hail a cab, a ride sounds good and cheaper."

Nox grinned.

Jason took Stella's bags the southern gentleman that he was.  There was only so much city slicker you could push at the man before his upbringing showed through.  

Nox got the door and Jason lead them all to his black SUV, and sure enough a kids car seat sat in the back.  "I take it Mia lets you take Naya around places."

Jason laughed, "She better, with another on the way."

Nox shook his head, "They are really cracking down aren't they?"

J nodded, "You have no idea.  Mia is okay with everything though, grew up hanging with us and all."

Nox smiled, "That's good. Would hate for your natural tendancy to mess with your marriage."  Nox shut the door after Stella had strapped herself and Aiden in.  Nox and J loaded the bags in the back of the vehicle.

Jason headed towards the passenger side of the SUV tossing Nox the keys.  "Figured you'd like to drive."

Nox threw J back the keys, "Not on your life."

J laughed and rounded the car and Nox was seated in the car first.  Jason soon followed and had the car movin before Stella finally asked, "So why the sign, Jason?"

Both Nox and J laughed, Nox answered even though the question wasn't directed at him.  "When J used to introduce me to other guys that he was setting me up with.  They inevitably asked, 'So you're gay?'".  J laughed as Nox rolled his eyes, "My response is the same as it was to you, usually preceded by, 'I'm not gay.'  Followed up with I like girls too or something of that nature."

She smiled, "I understand."

They chatted, J and Nox reminiscing about things of their childhood.  Stella asking about New York City and what was good about growing up here.  They pulled up to the Hotel Pennsylvania.  J whistled, "Fancy digs, damn good employer if they are putting interviewees up here."

Stella smiled, "My mother said it was some fancy rich firm that needed help."  She undid Aidan got out the passenger side door Nox had opened for her.  

Nox laughed, "Well maybe we'll just order in then.  I'll foot the bill, if you order for two and a half."

Stella smiled, "Still keeping me company tonight?"

"But of course."  Nox closed the door and got her bags out as the door man pulled a cart up.  Nox dropped the bags on the cart.

Stella smiled up at him, "I'll call you later and we can set a time."  She placed a kiss lightly on his lips leaving Nox wanting more as she started to walk away.

Nox got back in and J commented, "Damn!  You haven't even been home an hour yet and you already got a date."
