# Father Dearest

Nox headed for the stairs to the adult residences where his room would be found.  It was his until he was reassigned or until his status among the Venatori changed.  Singles slept in the residences in a small studio apartment.  Nox was grateful he had his own bathroom at least and a small kitchenette. 

Dorian was taking only small place in his head as he thought about what was going on here.  An untrained Cesari targeting two Venatori families - vengence was only the first angle.  There were all other sorts of reasons to target the Vega and the Videns families.  The least of all was vengence, power could be gained from a fractured family.  Both families were high in the heirarchy of things, the only other more powerful family was that of the Rivera's.  Dae'lin's blood line had been running aspects of the Venatori for as long as most people could remember.

Lost in thought Nox rounded a corner and ran straight into a man that despised him more than the monsters he hunted.  Nox saw the patterns shift around the man as he was rammed up against the wall with the speed and strength that had been a lacking trait of Nox's parentage.  The patterns did nothing for the moment and yet Nox watched them more than he watched the superhuman man pinning him to the wall.  Nox grunted as the air left his lungs and his father stood towering over him with his presence alone.

This was a man who tolerated nothing that was out of the ordinary, and he disliked that he had a half human son who was better than he was.  Nox looked at his father with a blank expression.  "Kai."

"Boy, I could rip you apart where you stood.  Leave this be.  I told Dae'lin I didn't need your help."  Kai sneered, "I told that her to leave you out where your mother died.  Right where you belong."

Nox smiled at Kai as the air around the man shifted and he was flung across the hall on wings of air that Nox had created.  The man looked back at Nox with an open mouth, surprise written all over his face.  "I was called in."  Kai started to speak and Nox silenced him with air so thick Kai started to choke. "I don't need you telling me what I should or should not be doing. I will not take your shit today."

Nox walked away, he heard Kai mumbling through the gag as Nox rounded the final corner to his temporary home releasing the patterns that bound his father to the wall.
