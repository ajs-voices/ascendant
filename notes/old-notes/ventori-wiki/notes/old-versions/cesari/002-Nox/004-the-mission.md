# The Mission

The remainder of the ride was mostly Jason poking fun at Nox. It was all good natured and fun, and Nox had missed his best friend. The familiar sight of the Bank of America Tower came into view and all sorts of memories flood into his head. None were overly good, but this really was home, even if everyone here was not overly fond of him. He was fond of it, this was home.

J parked the SUV and Nox took his bags and they walked towards the elevator. The same elevator that had Nox scared out of his little five year old mind when he first arrived. The same tight feeling in his chest came, it always did when he had to willingly submit himself to one of his greatest fears, and they would be going up rather high in this plate glass elevator.

Conquering his fears was one of the things he prided himself on, he'd been defying it since he was eight years old and just starting to jump off of buildings with only his gift to guide him safely to the ground. An elevator was perfectly safe. Nox forced himself to watch their ascent. Jason was oddly quiet as they rose up through the parking garage and then the lobby came into view.

Nox saw the familiar statue standing in the lobby. The stone man holding a plate of fire over his head with a globe of glass seemingly hovering over it with it's very own little ecosystem inside. Nox remembered the day he built it. The day he'd been called special. The day he learned that he could bend all four elements at the same time, a feat few could manage, must lest master and he had done both with ease.

Nox was assaulted the moment he stepped out of the glass death trap as white as a sheet despite himself. Dae'lin grabbed him by the front of his jacket and pulled him into a conference room. "Damn it, Nox.  Where have you been?"  He could smell her light floral perfume as he looked down on her raven hair.  Her dark eyes screamed at him, but her voice was soft and hard all at the same time.  Nox had no idea how she remained so feminine in her fury.

Nox could barely process anything as he leaned against the table, half sitting on it. A man much taller than Dae'lin walked in calm, cool and collected. His dark hair perfect despite the fact Nox knew he'd been running his fingers through it in frustration. He could see the small disarray of the pattern.  Dorian put his hand on Dae'lin's shoulder and moved her aside, "Dae'lin, he just rode an elevator, let him breathe a few minutes before he passes out."  

Dorian smiled at Nox, his bright blue eyes shining back, the tanned skin making his bright white smile stand out.  Nox's eyes traveled down the length of the other man's body.  He took in all of the Scrin who had once guided him through every obstacle that this life threw at him.  Dorian was wearing a tailored suit in navy blue.  His baby blue shirt was neatly starched and Nox could easily smell the familiar scent of vanilla and cinnamon that he'd come to associate with Dorian. Nox didn't remember Dorian being _that_ attractive when he was here last. 

Nox stood staring at the other man and when Nox looked up Dorian was watching him look him over.  Nox grinned back at him when their eyes met.  It was only a second but it was enough to make Nox's mouth go dry.  He looked to Dae'lin, "So nice of you to ask about my flight.  It went well.  I had a nice seat mate to keep my mind from playing games on me."

Nox heard Dorian chuckle.  Nox broke out in a grin as he walked around to sit on the other side of the table.  "What's the problem?"

Dorian started in, "Someone is targeting two Venatori families."  Nox quirked en eyebrow, it's not uncommon for Venatori to be hated by their peers or other supernatural beings.  It was the nature of being judge, jury and executioner for the supernatural community.  "Kai Videns youngest son was gifted a box that blew up in his face.  He is in critical condition in the Infirmary.  And just today my father has also received a package, but I notice it was emitting strange patterns, so I had it taken for investiagation."

"How is the mail getting past security?"  It was a simple question with a simple answer.

Dorian smiled at his knowing eyes, but Dae'lin answered, "The bombs are of all elements, formed at the same time the best we can figure.  There are very few who can see all four elements in the mail room."

Nox shook his head, "Even temporarily don't you think it is a good idea to put someone down there?"

Dae'lin laughed, "You want to navigate through mail all day?"

Nox grinned at her, "No, but if it saves lives then so be it.  The best use of my talents whereever they are needed."

Nox became serious and Dae'lin frowned at him, "Put someone on mail duty.  If Videns and the Vegas are being targeted there has to be a common denominator.  I'll sit my ass at a computer and look through files until I find something to hunt.  If you want me wasting my time in the mail room I'll do it because no one else will, but you didn't call me here to babysit things."

Dorian sighed, "Kai has been looking for connections.  He can't find any.  He won't like you looking."

Nox laughed, "Tough shit.  He can tell me that himself.  And then I'll just keep looking."

Dorian shook his head, "So much like your father."

Nox rolled his eyes and turned to Dae'lin.  "I'm here because you think this is another Cesari.  Everyone is accounted for I assume."

Dae'lin shook her head, "No, That's what Dorian beleives."

Dorian smiled, "No one believes anyone with in the compound has issues with us here.  The craftsmanship is untrained.  At least the box I saw."

Nox smiled, "So you think we have an untrained Cesari out there somewhere?   Someone found out about him or her and is using them against their enemies.  Videns and Vegas.  Thank you."

Dorian nodded, "No on else believes I'm correct.  Untrained Cesari being the rarest of the rare.  You are the last Cesari since your birth.  Statistics say there should be another, why not untrained?  The common theory is more than one assailent working with at least one other person.  Kai and my father beleive it's because the weaves are so erratic."

Nox nodded.  "You know the statistics better than anyone I know, I will go under your assumptions.  It is helpful and more plausible." 

Dae'lin stood up, "I will take my leave.  Nox, we have things to discuss at some point.  If you have issues with your father let me know immediately."

Nox laughed, "You think I don't know what it is you want to ask of me?"

Dae'lin turned a deep shade of red, it seemed he had that knack today.  "Either way, find me and we'll discuss it."

Nox laughed, he held back his comment, he wanted to tease her so bad, but he'd save it for later.  Nox stood up and started for the door.  Dorian caught his arm as he walked past and stood up, impossibly close to Nox.  The body heat from the other man could be felt on his hand.  Dorian placed a manilla folder against Nox's chest and smiled, "Some of my work on this.  After you are settled we can go over more if you'd like."

Nox grinned, "Maybe later."  Nox took the folder from Dorian, the tips of his fingers brushing along the other man's hand.  "Let me get reacquainted with the compound.  You know where I'll be if you get the itch to talk shop."  Nox steped around Dorian, his arm burshing the other man as he did.  Nox's heart was racing as he exited the conference room and started for his newly appointed room.
