# Just Sleep

Nox more or less just walked.  Dorian guiding him with a gentle tug or pull from the arm that was wrapped around his waist, the thumb of his hand stuck in the back of his jeans pocket, it made Nox smile, the little detail he'd picked up in all the haze he was feeling.  It had been two days and his world had blown up.  And now a guy he'd been gone to dinner with once, spent the night on his couch that very same night was guiding him through the maze that was the compound Nox had grown up in.

There was nothing said, and Nox didn't reallly object when Dorian used his key to unlock the door to his stark gray and white apartment.  Nox still felt like he wanted to stand still and not touch anything.  Dorian moved to the kitchen and started fumbling through his cabinents looking for something.  Nox heard him muttering to himself and smiled, it was unlike Dorian to show that side.  It made him curious. 

Nox walked over to the bar and sat down in the blood red chair and spun around once before catching himself at the edge of the bar.  Dorian was shaking his head at him with a wide toothy smile.  Nox was more than happy to entertain.  "What are you looking for?"  Nox asked Dorian, not that he could help him, but he was curious.

"Coffee.  Didn't think you'd want wine."

Nox smiled, "Top right cabinent near the fridge.  I put it back where I found it."

Dorian shook his head, "I don't drink coffee at home often.  Usually grab a cup with my breakfast."

"Which is not made in your gourmet kitchen."  Nox added with humor.

Dorian raised his hands in a huff.  He walked around the bar to where Nox sat and poked him in the arm.  "You find it then."

Nox grinned and stood up, his body pressed against the side of Dorian's.  He whispered, "I don't mind if I do."  But he didn't move as Dorian smiled at him.  Neither of them moved for several moments as they looked into each others eyes.  Nox felt that childish urge to have a stairing contest but he grinned and leaned in and kissed Dorian.  Dorian pulled him full against his body.  Nox took a deep breathe once the kiss broke.  "I'll see to that coffee now."  He whispered not trusting his voice.

Dorian chuckled as he sat down in the chair Nox had vacated.  "Are you hungry?"

Nox laughed, "Yes.  Are you?"  Dorian nodded.  Nox smiled, "Would you like me to cook for us?"

Dorian nodded his head a little more emphatically as he stood up.  He walked the short distance around the bar and wrapped an arm around Nox and pulled his phone from the back pocket it called home.  "Maybe a little show?"

Nox grinned.  "Maybe.  I don't know what you have to make."

Dorian smiled.  "Look."

Nox did as instructed and opened the fridge, it was still nearly empty, Dorian must throw away more food than he eats.  But on the top shelf sat two very thick prime cuts of steak.   He picked them up and found whatever else was edible in the fridge, Dorian had gone out of his way to buy food for Nox to cook at some point in the busy day.  Nox hadn't even thought about the dinner he'd asked Dorian to.  It was that kinda of day.

Nox dropped the steaks on the bar and smiled at Dorian. "I didn't think you'd have time to do it yourself with the way the day went.  So I had someone run an errand for me.  I hope that it's all okay."  Dorian was truly concerned about the quaility of someone elses work.  

Nox grinned, "It's all good."

Nox started prepping the steak, he watched as Dorian flipped through his phone looking at the playlist he assumed as the phone rang in his hand.  Dorian nearly dropped the phone before he swipped it, "Nox's phone."  Nox grinned as Dorian answered his phone.

"His hands are rather occupied at the moment I can put you on speaker phone?"

Nox mouthed, "Who is it?"

Dorian just grinned at him with a wink, he put the phone down and Nox saw Stella's name staring up at him.  Dorian flipped on the speaker, "You are on speaker now."

Stella's cheerful voice rang through the kitchen, "Nox?"

"Yeah.  I'm here."  He tried to keep a straight face, this was highly unusual.  "You back in Denver all safe and sound?"

"I am.  Who answered your phone?  He sounds familiar."  She asked without any hint of irony.

Nox grinned and Dorian looked at him waiting for him to answer the question.  "That would be Dorian."

Stella's voice stalled out in mid-repeat, "Dor.... As in ... Vega?"

Nox nodded, "Yes.  Dorian Vega.  I'm in his kitchen prepping steak for the two of us to eat."

"You're dating my ex-boyfriend?  Aidan's father?"  Her voice sounded almost furious and Nox wasn't exactly sure he knew why she'd be mad at him.

"I don't know if dating is the right word.  But yes, that's the Dorian I'm currently entertaining with this rather ironic phone call.  I didn't know when we met.  Dorian informed me after you got the job when you came up in a conversation we were having."  Nox set the steaks aside and turned to the sink to wash his hand.  The running water giving him a lull in conversation.

Stella asked another question Nox hadn't been expecting, "So you are one of these Venatori?"

Nox started washing the vegetables Dorian's errand boy had gotten, "I'm half Venatori.  I'm exactly like Aidan.  My mother was human.  My father was Venatori."

"So you understand all of this?"  Stella sounded almost excited.

Nox nodded, "Yeah I suppose I understand it more than most."

"So you can help me through this, understand it all.  Help Aidan?  More than Dorian?"

"Yeah, if you want me to."

"Why wouldn't I want you to?"  The disbeleif that he would ask such a question could be heard in her voice.

"Because as you put it, I'm dating your ex, his father."

"So you really are dating him?"  Did she sound sad?  

"If that's what you want to call two days of flirting and kissing and wanting more."  Nox confided, though Dorian was sitting across the bar listening to the conversation. 

"This is too much.  I'm goig to go now.  I wanted to call and let you know that I was home.  I will call you when I get back to New York okay?"  Stella sounded exasperated.

Nox nodded, "Call whenever you want to Stella. I'm okay with being friends, forgetting anything that might have been happening between us.  Stella, I'll be honest with you.  I really like Dorian and it's not fair to either of you."

Stella sighed, "I'll call you later Nox.  I have to think."

Nox nodded, "You have my number.  See ya Stella."  Dorian hung up the call with a tap of his finger.  

"You okay?"  Dorian asked.

"Yeah.  I'm okay.  I didn't expect to get much from that encounter after I found out who she was.  And after...jumping with you."  Nox figured he was already spilling things he should just keep it going.

"Wanting More?  What exactly do you want more of, Nox?"  Dorian smiled at him with that knowing smile that said he only wanted to hear Nox say it.

Nox swallowed hard, "Of everything."

Dorian grinned, "I'm going to go change into something less formal and more comfortable."  Nox frowned, he was going to miss the show.  Dorian hmmmed in question.  And Nox shook his head and shooed Dorian away.

"Nothing.  I'll be here slaving away over dinner."

Dorian left and by the time he returned Nox had finished cutting the vegetables into the oven to roast them with a little garlic and olive oil.  The steaks were setting in a light marinade that he'd found in the cupboard.  Dorian came out wearing a white t-shirt and a pair of knee length shorts.  His feet were bare and Nox bit his bottom lip as he watched him come back to his chair and sit down.  Nox asked as he stared at the man in front of him with lust written all over his face, "How do you like your steaks?"

"Medium Rare will do."  Dorian smiled at him, "I'm assuming this is acceptable."

Nox laughed, "Nothing would have been just as acceptable, but I don't think I could have finished dinner if you'd been wearing nothing."

Dorian chuckled.  

Nox set to working on finishing dinner, Dorian was at his back watching and making light conversation.  Nox couldn't help but feel those blue eyes on his neck the whole time.  He wished the stove faced the other direction so he could watch Dorian watch him.  Nox didn't dance around like he had with breakfast, there was no music and Dorian was tring to keep the conversation light and on topics other than where they had been before when Stella had called.

They ate dinner casually talking about what had gone down.  Dorian confided in Nox about the loss of his mother.  Nox mentioned Kai's favors he cashed in on his behalf with the whole breeding thing.  It was something he'd have to ask about at a later date, but the day grew on and Nox yawned and Dorian pulled him to his feet, "The bed tonight."

Nox smiled, "I wouldn't have it any other way."

Dorian walked Nox to his bedroom hand in hand.  He didn't turn on the light only pulled the sheets back and Nox ran his hand down the satin sheets.  "Microfiber.  Nice and silky and soft but annoying."

Dorian laughed, "Criticquing my sheets?"

Nox smiled as shrugged as he pulled his t-shirt over his head.  He caught Dorian watching him and he unbuttoned his jeans and unzipped them slower than usual just to tease Dorian and kicked off his shoes and stepped out of his jeans before he crawled into bed.  Dorian removed his short and t-shirt and they both were nearly naked, in only their boxers as Dorian crawled into bed next to him.  Nox curled up next to Dorian with his elbow propping up his head above Dorian's shoulder.  He leaned down and kissed Dorian.  It was slow and passionate and their tongues danced, a small moan escaped Nox's lips as he pulled away and slid down the length of Dorian to rest his head on the other man's shoulder and drapped his arm across him.  "Night."  Nox whispered.

Dorian kissed Nox's forehead, "Goodnight."
