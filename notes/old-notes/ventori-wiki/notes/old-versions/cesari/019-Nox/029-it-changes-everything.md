# It Changes Everything

Nox made it back to the Archives, he was a little winded, walking all those flights of stairs, it was great exercise and he had missed it though hiking was more adventerous in the long run, this felt more rewarding.  The air was not quite so thin here, he didn't feel like he'd run a marathon.  It was amazing what you got used to.

Nox sat down in the little room where he had found the files and started# trying to make the connections from Chicago to those who might have helped the exiled woman that seems to be behind the reason for this.  At least that was the best bet they could think of.  So Nox filtered through all the Exuli on file.  It was a daunting task but it was something he could at least do.

Oddly enough there were five Exuli families currently living in Chicago, including Levi's family. Nox grabbed the files of the five families and started towards Dae'lin's office.  He'd need someone to track down four of them.  Nox was going to go find Levi himself.  He had a very bad feeling about all of this.

A spurious little tune played on Nox's phone.  He was getting tired of the ring of unknown callers.  Nox answered, "Yeah?"

A familiar voice but yet unidentifieable started across the line.  "Nox?  Have you heard yet?"

Nox shrugged, "Heard what?"

"Your father..."  

Nox interupted, "What about my father?  I just saw him."

"He's..."  a short distance from the phone the voice called out.  "Dorian.  Good.  I've got Nox now.  Make sure to bring everyone up here."  

Nox heard on the other side Dorian speaking in his patient voice, one Nox knew well, "I know Father.  You told me already."

Nox sighed, "What happened Emilio?"  He at least now he knew who it was.

Emilio let out an exasperated huff of air, "Kai's been stabbed."

"WHAT?  I just saw him."

Emilio sounded rough, "He was found in a pool of his own blood.  We are hunting the footage as we speak.  I will be in the security room we were in last.  Meet me there."

Nox shook his head in disbeleif.  "I have a few things I have to do before hand.  I promise I'll help in a little bit."

"Nox, this is important!  Kai is in surgery, we have to find this man.  He's taking everything from us. Please help."  Emilio sounded desparate, he could forgive the anger, but what he had to do was important too.

Nox took a deep breathe, "Trust me, what I have to do is important.  We might be able to use what I find to get the guy."

Emilio sighed, "Alright fine!"  He hung up in a hurry and Nox was left with digital static before the phone cut off altogether.

Nox knew without a doubt now that Levi was somehow connected.  He had to find him.  But he couldn't beleive Kai had been hurt, what the hell had happened?  

Nox leaned against the wall in a daze.  The sounds of lockdown bringing him back to his senses.  Lockdown was going to inhibit his ability to move around.  This was not good for him in the short term, but in the long it was great.  No one without authorization was going to be moving around freely.

Nox called Emilio back, "Lockdown your idea?"

Emilio sighed, "No, Down from on high."

"I'll tell you what I'm doing, if you can help me."  Nox hoped that he'd help him.

"I won't agree until I know."

"I figured as much.  I think a kid I'm mentoring is involved.  If we find him, he is either the killer, or he's helping them.  He's Cesari, he's from Chicago, he's not been in classes for the better part of his stay here.  Today was his first day in classes and I'm pretty sure he has a Sox baseball cap but I don't remember exactly."

Emilio sighed, "Boy, you should have said that in the beginning.  I'll help you.  I can grant your access as you move around from here."

Nox nodded, "Good.  I have no idea where to start.  We need to find the scene of the attack and backtrack, maybe he'll show up there, or someplace.  I'm going to his rooms now."
