# Waiting

Nox stood in the hallway just watching the flames burn before the sickening stench of burning flesh rolled his stomach and he doused the corpse with a water pattern and turned around to walk away.  Emilio was calmly on the phone with someone, he was holding his shoulder like he was in pain.  Nox sighed, he'd hurt him saving him.  "Yeah, lift the lockdown.  Send people home.  We've a mess to clean outside the armory.  The fire is out now, so at least the danger is over."  Nox couldn't hear the other side of the conversation but Emilio chuckled, "Yeah the kid put it out finally.  You'd think he was a newb."

Nox grinned at that, he technically was, compared to Emilio anyway, he was only 3 years into his career.  3 years of being a solo hunter, and now he not only wasn't working alone, but with his father and Emilio Vega, two of the hunters nearly everyone looked up to.  And if he admitted it to himself he had as well before he'd found out who his father had been.  That was probably a big reason why he'd let Kai hate him so easily.  He could have tried to be nice instead of his usual prick self.  But it was hard to change when you had been hating your family your whole life.

Emilio hung up the phone with a smile of releif on his face.  "I thought you were going to let everything burn down."

Nox shook his head, "Sorry, got lost."

Emilio nodded, "Glad you are back with us.  Things are settling down.  Good job.  Though I think I need to head to the Infirmary now as well."

"As well?"  Nox asked confused?

"You are going there."  Emilio didn't sound like it was a question, it sounded more like a I'll drag you there if you don't go type of command.  

Nox grinned, "Yeah sure."

Emilio added as if it would have affect anything, "Dorian should still be there."

Nox rolled his eyes.  "I swear the two of you old people need to stay out of my love life."

Emilio laughed.  "I'm his father, it's unlikely.  And I think you father feels the same."

"You walk alright?  Or you need a shoulder?"  Nox asked Emilio nodding towards the injury.  "Sorry about that."

Emilio shrugged his shoulder and winced in pain.  "It could have been worse.  I'm thankful my blood remains on the inside, a fireball didn't scorch my body and that the worse that happened was a possible dislocated shoulder.  Thank you.  Though you are the cause of the missed fireball as well as the cause."

Nox grinned, "Sorry.  I play with my strengths."

Emilio nodded, "So I understand.  I won't breathe word of what the kid said.  I assume you told him in confidence to gain his trust."

Nox sighed, "Dae'lin and Kai already know.  I'm sure that the rest of the compound is well aware of my actions by now."

Emilio shook his head, "No son, Dae'lin only told Kai because she cares. "

Nox shook his head, "Telling Kai seemed reasonable to you?  The man has done nothing but tell me how worthless I am since he found out about me.  He's singing a different tune these days.  And I'll admit my part in it, but I'm still not impressed with Dae'lin telling my father what I did."

Emilio put his good arm around Nox and squeezed, "Let's go check on your father."  Nox took a deep breath and nodded.

Nox helped Emilio walk, he was sporting more than a dislocated shoulder his leg seemed to be dragging a little too.  But he was a live and that was what mattered in the long run.  And he'd be fixed up good as new soon anyway.

They reached the Infirmary by elevator, Nox's fear was only halved by the fact that he was still running on the adrenaline from the fight only a few minutes before.  They walked out and there was applause from the crowd.  Emilio beamed with pride and Nox tried to keep from rolling his eyes.  He didn't want their thanks, he'd taken a life without hesitation.  He'd broken a promise to himself.  But it had saved lives and he would do it again.  But it wasn't something to celebrate.  Men clapped Emilio on the shoulder and he winced in pain until Nox started fending them off with a glare.  Emilio smiled through the pain but it was still pain and there was no need for it.

Nox stopped at the nurses station, "He needs to be looked at.  Dislocated shoulder and I think his leg might have taken a beating too."  The nurse smiled at him with her crocked teeth and painted lips and took Emilio with a quick duck under Nox's arm.  He watched as Dorian's father hobbled away under the much shorter nurses guidance.  Emilio yelled back at Nox, "Thanks kid, now let's pray your father pulls his stubborn ass through that stabbing."

Nox grinned at Emilio's comment as he felt an arm wrap around his waist and the soft scent that meant Dorian was near tickled his nose.  Nox turned towars the man who'd come up behind him with a smile.  Dorian smiled at him and kissed him on top of the forehead, "Thanks for bringing him back alive."

Nox smiled, "No problem."  He looked around, the floor was nearly cleared for any bystanders now, Nox only saw Kai's family lingering in the waitingroom door way.  "How's Kai?"

Dorian shrugged, "Still in surgery.  Do you want me to stay?"

Nox looked around at the faced who were ragged with fear and grief.  Their father and grandfather was on the brink of life and they were praying for a miracle, but Nox didn't feel at home with them.  He nodded and Dorian guided him through the waitingroom door and they took a seat in the corner away from everyone else.  Nox leaned against Dorian's shoulder, "You have your father's angry voice."

Dorian chuckled, "No one's ever commented on that before."

Nox grinned, "He scared me like you did."

Dorian turned to look at Nox and Nox had to catch himself as he slide against Dorian's chest.  "I've never..."

Nox nodded, "Yes, once.  I was 6."  Nox leaned his forehead against Dorian's and whispered, "I lit Garret on fire - on purpose."

Dorian wrapped his arma round Nox's waist squeezed softly before he let go and pulled away to look Nox in the eyes.  "I knew then."

Nox could barely speak, he'd known.  Nox chocked out, "How?"

Dorian sat back against the chair and put his arm on the back of Nox's.  Nox sat back and Dorian's hand reached over his shoulder and rested against his neck, "Garret told me.  Told me he suspected it.  I knew you well enough, even then to know that you hadn't lost control.  I suppose that's why I was angry with you."

Nox leaned his head back against Dorian's arm, "I didn't hesitate again.  He's dead because of me."

Dorian nodded, "And the rest of us are alive because of you now.  Don't dwell on it, it's not your first kill."

Nox sighed, "It's the first I acted first on.  There was no blood traded.  I wasn't defending my life."

Dorian grinned, "You were defending my father's.  And for that I am grateful."

The doctor stepped in and Iris stepped over to him, they spoke in hushed whisperes and Nox watched Iris listen, the releif flooding over her face.  Kai would be okay.  She sat down on the nearest chair as the releif took her knees from under her, her hands cupping her face as she cried.  Nox wanted to know what the doctor said but he wasn't going to interrupt as the rest of the family huddled in around Iris and she whispered things.  

Nox only knew one of Kai's other sons by name, Marius was four years his senior.  He knew his brother's names, Tobias and Adam, but he couldn't tell one from the other, they'd changed since the alst time he'd seen them in grade school.  It was Marius who broke from their pack with a clap of his hand, "Hot damn!  Stubborn old man is gonna make it!"  He turned to look at Dorian.  "Provided he wakes up."

Dorian nodded, "Thanks man.  Apprciate it."

Iris looked up from their little group and nodded towards Nox, "I'll stay for a few hours, the rest of you all go home and get some much needed rest.  We'll take shifts.  No need for all of us to sit here and wait."

Nox nodded and stood up.  He put a hand on Iris' shoulder, "He'll make it.  I'll be back in the morning."  He didn't really wait around for an acknowledgement as Dorian followed him out the room.
