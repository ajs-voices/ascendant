# No Sleep

Nox took the stairs three at a time as he fled to his room. There was too much going through his head.   His father. Dae'lin wanting his seed.  Meeting Stella.  The least of which was a new appreciation for Dorian.  With a sigh he picked up the folder Dorian had given him and his laptop and plopped everything down on his bed.  The task felt daunting.  Too much on his mind.  But work was one way to forget everything that weighed on his mind.

Nox pulled off his t-shirts and threw them onto the nearby chair.  And lay down on the cool comforter than was really the only color in the room.  The walls were a beige gray sort of color, the carpeted floors near the same, the white molding being the only separation of color between the two boring colors.  The ceiling was white, stupid popcorn ceilings too, this room hadn't been remodeled since probably the early '80s.  The decor was poor, the paintings on the wall were flowers of unknown origin.  He hated flowers on the walls.  

Nox laid on his back and held up the folder over his head. He scanned the documents Dorian had thought were a good lead.  There were several cases that Kai and Emilio Vega had worked together.  But everything that Dorian had pulled seemed to end in the death of the creature.  There was little to go on from there.  Nox put the folder down and rolled over and ran his finger across the mouse pad on the laptop, the little machine roared to life.  His search results sitting neatly on top where he'd left them.

The same reports that Dorian had given him were sitting at the top of the search results.  More obscure references were left to follow.  Apparently Dae'lin had upped his security credentials in this mess. Nox saw all sorts of interesting tidbits of information that he hadn't had access to back in Boulder.  

The most notable being Headmaster reports from back in the days of Kai and Emilio as kids some 50 plus years ago.  Some little intern had gotten stuck some time ago putting every old record into the computer system, that had to be fun.  Nox glanced through those, mostly out of curiosity, not because they would hold any information that would be useful.

Kai was a trouble maker.  Not that it surprised Nox, not really.  Emilio appeared to be the one who tried to keep his friend from trouble, but almost always seemed to get caught up in the pranks.  Nox read through a few of the reports by the headmaster.  Kai had been a fire-starter too.  Not surprising.  He had nearly burnt down his room five times before he got his power under control.  

That was probably another reason Kai was angry with Nox.  He'd only done that once.  His first night in the compound.  Aaron, the prick that he was, had stolen his stuffed toy dragon Mushu, from the Disney flick Mulan.  Sure a girly flick, but Mushu rocked.  Who doesn't love talking dragons who help you pretend to be a boy.  Nox could feel Mulan's struggle through it all, being different was always something he'd felt.  

His sexual preferences being the least of his issues, he was younger than most in the academy.  He had been good at bending the elements, all of them.  He was born to a human mother and his father was Venatori, a fatal combination for mother and child usually, but they had both survived.  Then he became Cesari far younger than most other did.  The ability to bend all elements at the same time set him apart from everyone.  His training differed, it really had only been J who had gotten him through the last eight years at the academy.  His friendship pulling him along to parties and other things, other exploits as Dae'lin had put it.

He and his father were similar in many ways, but Kai's trip through the academy was far less hindered by his difference to his peers.  It was good insight into his father, but little help to the task at hand.

The trip down memory lane didn't really help matters.  Everything was still a  mess.

Nox started going through the more obscure files on the bombing case, those files not relating to to the Videns and Vegas in their school years.  Nox stretched out on his bed, the laptop in front of him while he laid on one arm, it was getting late.

Nox yawned and rubbed his eyes but sleep was still very far from reach, each time he closed his eyes visions collided with one another, everything from sky jumping with J to Stella answering the door without the towel wrapped around her body.  He saw visions of his father as a child and being friends with him at that age.  So instead of closing his eyes he pushed forward in the files until the sun started to creep up on the horizon.
