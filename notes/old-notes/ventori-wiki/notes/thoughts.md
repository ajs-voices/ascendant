# Thoughts

* What if the Aeternus were ancient ancestors of the Venatori?  The Ventatori being a subrace of the Aeternus to begin with.  The Venatori were the supernatural hunters that they were supposed to be.  But because the Venatori were born and breed to be the best possible hunters, mixture with other 'races' (predominately human) has made them mortal, and lessened their Aeternus likeness while enhancing their abilities.
 * Aeternus would be immortal yet a thought to be extinct race.  Much like the gods of old (think the Titans) their offspring erradicated them slowly one by one until none were left.
 * The Venatori breed with humans to increase their capacity as hunters for cleverness and 'outside the box' thinking.  Aeternus by their very nature are very stuck in their ways, they do things one way because they've always been done that way.  This interracial mix had a determental effect on all offspring, mortality, while they retained some of their supernatural abilities, mortality was deemed acceptable because they mental facalties and the ability to find creative solutions out weighed the death of their numbers.  Venatori typically lived short lives anyway due to their career 'choice'.
 * Aeternus have the ability to morph their appearance every 20 years to continue living a normal life. (ala Dr. Who)

Asher is remembers seeing the first Venatori (as they exist today) this first venatori is called a Preamble.  The first of many, and the key to the genetic code for the Venatori.  (Nox is a preamble for the next interation of the Venatori/Aeternus)
