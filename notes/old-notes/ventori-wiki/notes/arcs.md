# THE CCB

* The cult is 'political' in nature - it seeks to rid the world of Venatori rule. Until recently the cult used pacifist measures to state their claims, never coming to violence.  The cult is usurped by Garret and two were creatures who take this peaceful group and turn them into the Venatori's worst nightmare (and Asher's) by threateneing to expose their world.
