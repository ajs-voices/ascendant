# Levi Hughes, NNC4, Exuli (The Acheiver)

Levi's parents were both ANI2 when they left with their ability intact as they were deamed trust worthy.  Sara and Hamilton Hughes were upstanding citizens of the Venatori but they were unhappy with the way the politics of the system went.  They left the Venatori and became Exuli.  Upon their leaving they were approached by James Wright, a leading memeber of the CCB.  They joined and were active in their efforts.  A few years later they had a son.  Levi grew up with the CCB philosphies engrained in him.  When he 'accidentally' burned down his house with his parents inside even the CCB knew he was dangerous.  They sent the danger into the Venatori Academy itself to wreak havoc on their institution.  Levi's ulitimate goal was to take out as many key players as he possibly could before he would ultimately get caught.

Fear: Fear of being worthless (#3)
Desire: Right wrongs created by the Venatori
