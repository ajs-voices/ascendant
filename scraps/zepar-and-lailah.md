# Zepar and Lailah	

## Summoning Zepar

Bronson Durante was nothing more than a paralegal.  He worked for Smits, Smith, and Schmidt - a group of lawyers who focused predominately on divorce.  He wasn't tall at 5 food 8 inches.  He wasn't handsome in the traditional sense - he had scraggly brown hair that was already graying at the age of 25.  He wore a stylish mustache that made his nose look big and his mouth too small.  His gray eyes were deep set and hidden behind scraggly eye brows and droopy lids.  Even though his suits were tailored to fit when he was 22 they didn't fit him now, he'd lost weight, not that he'd been fat to begin with - stress decreased his appetite and work was just so damned busy Bronson didn't find any time to eat.

He was nothing short of ordinary.  But that was all about to change.  The problem with being a paralegal is the surmountable amount of research one must do.  While digging into to the nitty gritty of a marriage gone horribly wrong, Bronson found himself knee deep in witchcraft and wizardry.  You might think he was crazy if you saw the things he'd found.  But their client believed it - she claimed to be a witch.  

She preformed some parlor trick in the middle of their office - drawing a pentagram and lighting candles and the lights flickered and she want into a trance all to prove that her husband had been cheating on her.  He was - the could prove it.  The prenup pretty much declared her sole owner of their estate if he cheated - or she cheated he would - but there was no evidence of that.

But it was the after hours talks that drew Bronson to Ms. Delray - Delilah, as she liked him to call her.  Delilah gave him a book - The Surmountable Power of Zepar.

Zepar was a demon.  Bronson didn't believe in demons - or angels or magic really.  But the thing about magic was you didn't need to believe in it for it to be real - it was.

It had been a joke when Bronson pulled out the book - drew the circle and pentagram on the laminate floor of his dining room.  He didn't believe.

The words came out of his mouth unhindered by the disbelief he felt.  They held power that Bronson had never realized anyone in the world could have.  He still didn't believe it was magic - just a feeling - his own body reacting to the potential power he was about to unleash - but he still didn't believe.

A swirling mist of black dust rose up from the circle.  A faint glow of fires below lit the dark room.  The smell of rotten eggs permeated every crack and crevice of his apartment.  

When the dust died down, a strange creature stood in the circle - it was indescribable.  Razor sharp teeth, long piercing claws, that dripped black goo.  It was completely opaque yet Bronson could see through it - see beyond - see into the fires of hell.  It's eyes were dead and black as coal.  Looking into them was like getting lost in the depths of the ocean.  Bronson couldn't breathe.

But he didn't need to.  Zepar smiled with his razor like teeth as he crooked his finger and Bronson crossed the circle.  It was only a small slip.  A tiny little broken circle.  Zepar laughed as he devoured Bronson Durante.  The man was ordinary - completely not worthy of his time - but freedom called and Zepar gobbled up the chance to be free - to walk among humans - to procreate - to drink and laugh and be free - but most of all it was the freedom.

Zepar was free!

## Reprieve 

The world was a beautiful place - full of light and things to make anyone rejoice.  But Lailah was not human, nor was she of their world.  She was an angel.  Blessed to live forever.  Lailah loved watching over women who would soon be blessed with children.  But she envied them - never to give birth herself - never to hold a child in her arms.  She was sad in this beautiful world.

But it was the prayers of one of the faithful that called Lailah to the oncology ward at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital.  It wasn't something Lailah usually came for, but the prayers were unique - calling to save an unborn child - one that didn't yet exist.  Intrigued Lailah watched the woman - her name was Dawn.  

She was beautiful, strawberry blonde hair with gray eyes, there was a glow about her despite the cancer that Lailah clearly saw growing enmasse in this child of the heavens.  It made Lailah weep seeing the dark cancer growing inside the woman.  

The prayers were still being whispered on the winds as Dawn Payne put on a smile and listened to the doctors.  "Please save my yet conceived child.  There is greatness inside me, I want only enough time to give birth to it."

And Lailah saw the truth in the matter - saw the pure heart to be.  It was one of her gifts bestowed upon her creator oh so long ago - the precognition to see greatness and destruction in the children she watched over.   She saw greatness in the child yet to be born.

Lailah left her otherworldly body in that moment.  She cupped her hands around the face of the woman before her and whispered into the aether between them.  "Accept me, and I will grant your dying wish."

Dawn blinked as she heard the wind speak back to her, though Lailah hadn't understood how the world did not hear their calls all the time, it was no different this time than any other.  But Dawn smiled and nodded, "Yes." 

Lailah smiled and entered the body before it.  The pain was extraordinary.  It burned as her essence expanded into the human body.  It was the first time Lailah had done this and she didn't think she would ever do it again.  But she would grant this woman the wish and then flee to her home and watch the greatness that is the child born to the woman.  It would grant her own wish as well - to mother a child for the first time.

Senses blurred.  Names became mixed.  Thoughts and memories jarred into place.  Lailah was no longer herself - not completely.

## Meeting

The world saw Bronson Durante differently these past few months.  It showed in the way he held himself and the way he spoke to people.  He commanded power now.  He felt on top of the world.  It had been confusing at first, this change in demeanor.  But now, it was perfectly normal.  This paralegal was no longer anyone's doormat.

Bronson found himself out every night of the week - at a club or a bar, or a sporting event.  What better place to meet a woman of a like mind.  The women saw him differently.  It was noticeable when a blonde who was beyond the scale Bronson had ever attempted smiled at him first.  First!

She wore her hair off her neck, her skin was the perfect shade - almost glowing with life.  Her gray eyes were vibrant and she smelled like wildflowers in the summer rain.  She was heavenly.

Her voice was soft and demure as she asked, "Do you know anything about Oblivion?  I'm lost here.  But my father use to bring me here, I thought I'd remember something."

Bronson knew nothing about horses.  He came for a different breed of animal.  He smiled at her and tucked her under his arm and lead her away to the stands to watch.  "The best way to learn is to watch."

Once in the stands Bronson extended his hand.  "I'm Bronson Durante."

She took it his hand with care, caressing his knuckles before releasing it.  "Dawn Payne.  Amateur Horse Watcher."

Bronson chuckled.  "We are all Amateur's at something."  He leaned in and caught that beautiful scent lingering on her skin - he could swear he could almost smell the sweat forming on her delicate skin out of lust-filled desire.  He hummed to himself.  "Myself, I could use a few pointers when speaking to the ladies." 

She blushed and put her hand on his leg.  "I think you are doing just fine, Bronson.  It's alright if I call you that?"

Bronson nodded.  "Of course, Dawn.  Of course."

For three days Bronson courted Ms. Payne.  They watched the horses, they golfed, though neither of them had ever played before that first day.  It was a match made in heaven.  They went to a wine tasting in the Hamptons, and sailed on a yacht where they shared a first kiss.

That first kiss had lead straight to the bedroom.  She was as eager as he was to dim the lights and explore the nether regions of their bodies.  It was sensual, and fulfilling in every possible sense of the word.  

Fingers ignited nerves.  Mouths consumed each other.  Tongues danced across teeth and skin.  Teeth nipped at tender skin long before their bodies joined together in harmony.  

The yacht lifted anchor while the couple frolicked in their cabin below deck.  The moonlight guiding the captain to his nighttime berth.  The scent of the sea drifted in through the open window lingering with the scent of their passion.

A bell rang on deck and the crew disembarked leaving the couple alone in their passion.  Midnight stuck and Bronson woke to an eerie feeling - a feeling of a job well done - perfectly destructive, perfectly barren.  He looked down on the angel lying next to him and smiled, his libido wanted more but his legs spoke a different story.  He got up, pulled his clothes on and slipped out the door long before the elegant Ms. Payne woke from her own slumber.  

## Betrayal

Waking alone in bed had been dreadful, but three weeks later the news was wonderful - with child.  A wonderful beautiful child.  Greatness.  Wonder and enchantment lie in wake, erasing all sadness from the perfect three days with Bronson Durante.

Less than 9 months later the girl erupted from her womb with a raucous cry that Lailah felt in the depths of her belly.  She'd leave soon - leave Dawn to her fate, the child born - the greatest gift she could ever receive was about to happen - to hold the child of her loins.

The nurse placed the girl in her arms and she was pure and perfect and her skin as smooth as silk and the color of milk.  Perfect child - great child.

But that perfect moment was broken - shattered when a man stormed into the door of her birthing sweet.  Senses dulled from the labor pains slowed the recognition of Bronson staring back at her - there was fire in his eyes.  Hell burning in his soul.  He raved, "How did this happen?"

He seemed utterly confused as he raised the black barrel of a gun at Dawn.  The woman still in shock from her delivery.  The child was whisked away by the nurse only moments before for care.  He'd been oblivious to the transition.  Oblivious to his daughter leaving the room.

There were men in white shirts and black pants pulling and tugging at Bronson.  He was raving the same question over and over.  He pulled the trigger.  And it was the end.  Lailah drifted above the body that had been Dawn Payne.  Saddened by her death Lailah wailed but it was the second gun shot that echoed in Lailah's ears.

The being that rose from the now collapsed body of Bronson Payne chilled Lailah's soul - a demon.  The corrupter of wombs - the worst of them all.  Lailah's cry grew louder and Zepar only laughed.  "Stupid man, didn't kill the child.  Too bad for him.  I will have to find another way."

Lailah vowed, "You will have to go through me."  It was just a thought, a quick moment and she was hovering over the child.  The pure child born of demon and angel and human - a Nephilim - greatness bestowed upon both heaven and hell.  The world was about to change.
