## Description

### Physical

Nox is 6’0″ weighing approximately 145 lbs with a hard to maintain thin athletic build. He has chestnut brown hair with chocolate brown eyes framed with a thick set of eye lashes any woman would die for. He tends to have a few days growth beard mustache carefully managed. Nox almost always has a playful grin plastered on his lips, like everything’s a joke to him.

Nox tends to wear eye liner and dyes the tips of his hair in bright colors with matching finger-nail polish. His favorite colors being sapphire blue, crimson red and orange. He has been known to wear flavored lip gloss.

He likes to wear t-shirts with obnoxious sayings, he thinks they are funny and doesn’t care if you are offended by them. He always wears a hoodie (pull over or zip up). Nox’s hands with his long slender fingers are the most defined feature he possess other than his eyes and smile.

Nox’s body is host to a few scars he’s more than willing to tell you a false tale about how he got them. (A vampire bite on his right forearm. Claw marks on his left rib cage from a were-bear, a slash across his left cheek from the dagger of a ghost possessed human, burn on his right leg from knee to ankle from a dragon’s flame) And one set he doesn’t want to talk about and usually covers up at all times: a series of slash marks across his back from early childhood abuse. He tends to hide these scares underneath clothing or a personal veil he learned from his abuser.

Nox has a delicate black ink dragon he calls 'Mushu' at the back of his neck just below the base of his skull. During his Ad Aetatem Nox received his tribal tattoo – a pair of crossed swords at his right temple.
